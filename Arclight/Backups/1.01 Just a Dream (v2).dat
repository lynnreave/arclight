I snapped back out of it with a gasp as the air suddenly came back, inflating my chest. Too far. I still felt the rush of cold night air and black as I fell.{&1310}\par I hit the ground with my back, and all that breath got shoved back out in a rush. I didn't die, so I glanced down to that hole punched through my chest. It still hurt. The back of my skull hurt. But the hole was missing.{&1310}\par "What ...?"{&1310}\par I blinked up at the fury of motion all around me, but it was dark. Shapes started to come back in a rush so abrupt it made me sick to my stomach. Someone was standing over me.{&1310}\par "Ms. Weir - if you're ever going to move something with your mind, you might want to start using it for something other than daydreams and banging against the floor."{&1310}\par A chorus of laughs sprouted up in random pockets around me. I just turned my head aside, and puked.{&1310}\par {&1310}\par {&1310}\par {&1310}\par Things settled more by the time Dr. Holloway got me to the infirmary. Class was dismissed, but I couldn't take much joy in that today. The headache I got for my trouble was splitting, and one of the nurses had me holding a cold compress against my forehead while the doctor on call ran some perfunctory scans on me. He looked bored, and preoccupied as he rubbed his nose, looking at the screen.{&1310}\par "Nothing out of the ordinary, Evelyn," he was saying, sitting at the med terminal beside the bed they laid me down on. "I can give you something for the headache, but it won't get you out of any classes. Sorry."{&1310}\par He forced half a smile for me. Tired. It wasn't the first time I'd been in there. Not even the second. Maybe just the first time I'd vomited all over myself in front of Holloway and his intro class. He hadn't looked to happy about having to chaperone me to sick bay this time.{&1310}\par The nurses liked me. Most of the doctors didn't. I was in there too often for them - always for the same thing. Another episode, another scan, and another injection for the headache. It couldn't take away the big bruise on the back of my skull this time, though. Holloway had ripped me back out of that nightmare. Tired of it, I guess. It was the first time I'd fallen out of my chair.{&1310}\par I mumbled some thanks to him and got a few nice words from the nurse before they sent me on my way. Then I trudged back home and read up on a few of the things that dad assigned before passing out. More research papers and random history books. I skimmed, for the most part.{&1310}\par Dad didn't come home that night. I woke up, still hunched over my desk with half my face plastered to the metal, and no one had even opened the door.{&1310}\par {&1310}\par {&1310}\par {&1310}\par "Seemed a bit slow today, Evelyn."{&1310}\par I all but collapsed to the deck after Jonathon had finished putting me through my paces for the day. I'd been sluggish, and ran out of breath too easily. He beat me quicker than usual, and I had been excited about getting better. He retracted the fighting stick and tossed it my way. I didn't even have the wherewithal to catch it, watching it clatter across the floor and away instead. He frowned at me.{&1310}\par "I hope you're not getting bored."{&1310}\par I tried to shake my head, and the last of my hair came loose from its tie in sweaty, black knots.{&1310}\par "You sure?"{&1310}\par He gave me the hard edge of his voice. I bobbed my head, still trying to suck air in through my teeth. And he followed through with a heavy look for a minute as I pulled myself back together.{&1310}\par "Well, we'll see if you make it back tomorrow then."{&1310}\par I gathered my things, got showered and changed back home, then dragged myself to class for the day. They were pretty excited to see me again, just like always.{&1310}\par I got tired of the snickering partway through, and I had to ignore a few more pantomimes and dumb puns than usual. Lots of kids got a kick out of me still being in Holloway's class. I guess they thought I was pretty stupid for never progressing past the intro course on Peekay. It didn't matter that Dr. Weir was one of the most respected theorists and researchers on the station. His daughter was just a mundane - sitting in a room full of fifteen-year-olds after almost seven years of not once showing any spark of talent. Dr. Holloway wondered why I was still wasting his time. But he knew that dad made me go, every day.{&1310}\par I muddled through it in a haze for a few hours until I got out again. And then it was to go see the psychiatrist. Dad always bought his time out whenever I had another episode. I got the message this time, as soon as I got back home, and then I was sitting for Dr. Miller in his office. {&1310}\par \pard\fi720\sl480\slmult1 "Another dream?" he asked, pulling a pad out and glancing at me briefly. "Something new, or another of the same from before?"{&1310}\par I told him it was nothing new. I'd had that one about the man getting chased by whatever those things were and finding the woman in the river. All the details were the same. He ran me through them, over and over. Just like always. I thought he was trying to see if I would say something different, but I wasn't sure what that would tell him.{&1310}\par "Still seen through his eyes?"{&1310}\par "Like I was right there." I waved my free hand out irritably. "And inside his head." Maybe they all thought I was a bit crazy, but I'd lived with it long enough to just want to ignore and get past it. And Miller just wanted to disect every painful detail.{&1310}\par When we were finally done, he let me out with a generous smile. I got the feeling that he pitied me. Oh well. Hopefully it would be a few weeks until I saw him again. He probably felt the same.{&1310}\par \cf2\highlight0\f2 {&1310}\par }{&1310}
