You could always tell someone new to the station by how much they gawked at that.{&1310}\par "Too bad," Tess sighed aloud at some point. She was perched with her chin in one hand, leaning on the rail and looking up. I'd been looking down.{&1310}\par "Too bad what?"{&1310}\par "Out there," she pointed to the Rift. "It'd be nice to go out there."{&1310}\par "I guess."{&1310}\par "You know I could get us on one of those survey ships.

Who are you kidding?"{&1310}\par "Why not?"{&1310}\par Maybe I just sounded too bored, because she didn't bother to answer. Just kept giving me that eye.{&1310}\par "You going to skip out on Ressler again later?" I asked.{&1310}\par "I was thinking about it." She slumped down onto both elbows along the rail before glancing back up at me. "Why? You gonna ditch fer once too?"{&1310}\par "Nope. I just don't want to get stuck cleaning the ducts out for him again by myself."{&1310}\par A smile broke out slowly across her face{&1310}\par "Oh, yeah ... sorry."{&1310}\par "No you're not."{&1310}\par She laughed about the whole thing quietly to herself for a while. I went back to watching the people moving about below in the courtyards. Some of the gardeners were out now. Every so often dad loaned me out for some chores with them. It was better than working maintenance for Ressler at least. And the gardens were very pretty. Serene, I suppose. I could appreciate it a bit more having helped keep it that way more than a few times.{&1310}\par "By the way," Tess came back down at some point, "You wouldn't happen to have the- Oh."{&1310}\par I stuck out the data stick I'd pulled out of my jacket pocket for her. {&1310}\par "All of the books for the last week."{&1310}\par "Sweet."{&1310}\par She lit up at that, snatching the thing eagerly from my fingers and tucking it away. It was habit by now, but I still shook my head. I was already sick of them before dad even opened his mouth to assign a new one. Not her, though. I guess it was easier to want what you couldn't have. God knows, no one would trust her around anything valuable or important.{&1310}\par "You remembered it this time," she couldn't help muttering under her breath, and barking a laugh of a sudden. "Ya know what? Yesterday, I was- oh shit."{&1310}\par Her eyes went wide. Horrified. And I turned around to see where she was looking.{&1310}\par "What?"{&1310}\par I got my answer just as quickly. Part of it, anyways. A man in Watch uniform was making his way toward us from the other end of the catwalk. Fast.{&1310}\par I twisted right back around at Tess.{&1310}\par "What did you do?"{&1310}\par I started to cry out at her. But I only got partway. Before I could even open my mouth, she was already moving.{&1310}\par "Run!" she shouted back over her shoulder at me without even glancing back.{&1310}\par "HEY!"{&1310}\par That man bellowed out as us from behind. \i Us\i0 , because he wasn't just looking at Tess. So much for keeping out of it. I glanced back at him, then to Tess darting off and away.{&1310}\par "Shit."{&1310}\par I took off after Tess in a blind rush, and the Watchman broke into a run too. My legs were still a little shaky from the other day with Jonathon, but I could outrun Tess - or any of them - in a flat sprint any day. I bolted, and flew right past her with barely a second to spare. She huffed something back at me, but I could care less. Whatever it was, it was her fault anyways. Then I just heard that Watchman behind us.{&1310}\par "... The hell with this."{&1310}\par Tess broke left and hopped the railing. I don't know what the hell she was thinking, but I didn't get a chance to care. A step away from the end of the catwalk, something bit into my back. Then every muscle in my body suddenly went limp all at once. I toppled like a dropped sack, folded up, and half-rolled over onto my face into the first stair down.{&1310}\par And then I had just enough time to watch the Watchman make the last few steps easy on himself catching up with me as I lay there twitching in spurts against the metal.{&1310}\par "Nice try, kid."{&1310}\par He gave that stun gun a few more clicks for good measure, but I couldn't feel it.

I didn't get very far by the time I heard heavy footsteps clomping past just outside. I just put a finger to my lips for the woman, and held my breath.{&1310}\par The door hadn't closed. And Ressler must have taken that for an invitation. The old woman's eyes flashed back toward the open doorway as the short man puffed his way up to it. He caught himself there.{&1310}\par "Sorry to bother you, Eleanor," he started after a moment, the polite tone contrasting harshly enough with the past few minutes for me to scowl there in the corner. "Mrs. Sweeney," he amended. "But did you see that black-eyed brat run through here just now?"{&1310}\par The old woman just folder her wrinkled hands carefully with a small smile.{&1310}\par "And which brat would that be, Ressler?"{&1310}\par I could hear him sigh loudly in the door. He made it sound more like a grunt.{&1310}\par "Nolan's kid. Not the other one."{&1310}\par "Oh." Eleanor shook her head ever so slightly. Then turned her attention back to whatever she had been working on before I showed up.{&1310}\par "No. I can't say that I have."{&1310}\par Ressler stood there for a few moments longer. I would have sighed in relief, had I dared. But I settled for shouting how much I loved that old woman inside my head instead. I think Elle even heard me.{&1310}\par "Then why was your door open?"{&1310}\par That caught me up. I stiffened, and nearly blurted something out before I could stop it. I didn't, though.{&1310}\par Elle didn't even miss a beat. She just looked leisurely back toward Ressler at the door, and smiled.{&1310}\par "I like the fresh air."{&1310}\par I guess that was enough for him. I waited on pins and needles while he sighed heartily at the door. Then apologized and left.{&1310}\par "Now, tell me, Evelyn," the old woman was demanding after he had gone. "Why did I just lie to poor Ressler?" Her tone had turned harsh again. "He works so hard to keep this place in working order ..."{&1310}\par I was too busy sliding down against the bulkhead with my back in relief. The bags touched down around me, and I just sat there for a few seconds, feeling much better.{&1310}\par "Evelyn."{&1310}\par "What? Oh." I blinked my eyes back open. "I forgot to do something for him," came the tentative excuse. "But it's really too late now."{&1310}\par Surprisingly, the old woman took that for what it was.{&1310}\par "Ah. Your father told me you were leaving today." She looked back to her work, as if the matter was done. I just leapt back to my feet at that.{&1310}\par "He was here?"{&1310}\par She nodded at me, glancing up once more. {&1310}\par "About an hour ago. Just picked up some of his work from the past few months and said his goodbyes," she waved a spotted hand aside. "Seemed like he was in quite a hurry."{&1310}\par "Where did he go?" I had the edge of her desk clutched under my knuckles at that, leaning forward.{&1310}\par She regarded me for a moment. I guess I was being a bit overbearing, and I eased back a bit. She took off her glasses to wipe at them with a sleeve. {&1310}\par "I'm not sure. But if he's planning on leaving the station," she gave me that wise, old thoughtful tone, "I would think he would have to go through the shuttle bay at some point. Wouldn't you agree?"{&1310}\par "\i Yes \i0 ..."{&1310}\par I twisted away, frustrated. It made perfect sense, of course. But I hadn't thought of it. Not in all those hours I spent running around looking uselessly.{&1310}\par And he would have assumed I was smarter than that. His mistake.{&1310}\par "Thanks, Elle!"{&1310}\par I was almost out the door again without a second thought. Almost. I ended up smacking straight into a wall, though, instead. An invisible one.{&1310}\par I managed to stumble back a step without falling flat on my ass. When I came back around, Elle was sitting there smirking in that patient way she had. She extended an elegant finger back toward the corner.{&1310}\par "I hope you're not planning on leaving those here with me."{&1310}\par "Oh. Yeah."{&1310}\par As I trudged back over and grabbed my bags again, she mumbled something unintelligible under her breath. And when I got back to the door, that wall was gone.{&1310}\par "Evelyn?"{&1310}\par "Yes?"{&1310}\par I came back around at the last before slipping all the way out. The older woman didn't say anything, though. Just smiled at me and shook her head. I smiled back.{&1310}\par Then I left.{&1310}\par }{&1310}

I went back to watching the people moving about below in the courtyards. Some of the gardeners were out now. Every so often dad loaned me out for some chores with them. It was better than working maintenance for Ressler at least. And the gardens were very pretty. Serene, I suppose. I could appreciate it a bit more having helped keep it that way more than a few times.{&1310}\par "By the way," Tess came back down at some point, "You wouldn't happen to have the- Oh."{&1310}\par I stuck out the data stick I'd pulled out of my jacket pocket for her. {&1310}\par "All of the books for the last week."{&1310}\par "Sweet."{&1310}\par She lit up at that, snatching the thing eagerly from my fingers and tucking it away. It was habit by now, but I still shook my head. I was already sick of them before dad even opened his mouth to assign a new one. Not her, though. I guess it was easier to want what you couldn't have. God knows, no one would trust her around anything valuable or important.{&1310}\par "You remembered it this time," she couldn't help muttering under her breath, and barking a laugh of a sudden. "Ya know what? Yesterday, I was- oh shit."{&1310}\par Her eyes went wide. Horrified. And I turned around to see where she was looking.{&1310}\par "What?"{&1310}\par I got my answer just as quickly.

So much for keeping out of it. I glanced back at him, then to Tess darting off and away.{&1310}\par "Shit."{&1310}\par I took off after Tess in a blind rush, and the Watchman broke into a run too. My legs were still a little shaky from the other day with Jonathon, but I could outrun Tess - or any of them - in a flat sprint any day.

I don't know what the hell she was thinking, but I didn't get a chance to care. A step away from the end of the catwalk, something bit into my back.

I toppled like a dropped sack, folded up, and half-rolled over onto my face into the first stair down.{&1310}\par And then I had just enough time to watch the Watchman make the last few steps easy on himself catching up with me as I lay there twitching in spurts against the metal.{&1310}\par "Nice try, kid."{&1310}\par He gave that stun gun a few more clicks for good measure, but I couldn't feel it.
