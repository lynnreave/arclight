I hadn't been up here since in-processing, filtering in with all the other raw recruits brave, reckless, or stupid enough to sign their life away to the Grand Admirals and the Dreggoran Navy. There was a moment then when the knowing of had finally caught up with me. Up until that point, it had felt like a dream -- a distant possibility that couldn't really change things so much but would just \i happen\i0  eventually. Fear had settled over me like a cold blanket being drawn up by unseen hands and I'd looked around at everyone else, noticing that same dawning realizing mirrored back on their faces. {&1310}\par What the hell was I thinking? What have I gotten myself into?{&1310}\par I'd been just a civilian back then. Frightened. Alone. Vulnerable. We all had been. Now we were trainees and cadets, and it seemed like a lifetime ago. Like it had been someone else who had done it. Not me.{&1310}\par I remembered Komi from back then. Aloof, but not like I had been with so many civilians I hadn't grown up around suddenly jostling around me. Recruitment campaigns were effective, and everyone hated what the pirates were doing. Komi had joined because she wanted to do something about it. She had been sure of herself even back then, though it was a quieter and less vetted confidence in herself. I'd barely paid her any mind until we were suddenly rackmates. I had joined because of dad.{&1310}\par They'd called Komi up here a few times -- for good reasons -- so she mostly knew the way. Escorting me wasn't quite the right way to think about it since we weren't supposed to go anywhere without at least one other person and certainly not to the officers' decks. We got stopped almost every five steps, offering a perfunctory salute to some crewman or naval officer wanting to know what we were even doing there. Cadets were usually escorted by their training officer. Morisant didn't meet us until we were right outside the commander's office.{&1310}\par "Cadets Kominshk and Weir, reporting as ordered, sir," Komi stated formally for the both of us. Only one of us had to.{&1310}\par "Cadets," he acknowledged us crisply, but didn't return our respectful salute. Active service members didn't have to do that onboard a ship. We did. {&1310}\par Conditioning.{&1310}\par "Kominshk."{&1310}\par "Aye, sir?"{&1310}\par "You're dismissed, cadet. Head back to the squad bay."{&1310}\par Komi glanced at me out of the corner of her eye, but she didn't object about being sent back alone instead of being told to wait. Not to an officer. Not to Morisant. It was strange, and a whole bunch of worries started crowding back in my head along with that creeping sensation that something was wrong. Something more than just my poor scores. Komi must have thought that too because she hesitated for an almost imperceptible fraction of a second. I wouldn't even have noticed if I hadn't been looking for it since the idea of being left alone was so suddenly more terrifying than even coming here in the first place. But then she was about-facing and marching away toward the lifts back down to our squad bay's deck. There was nothing else for her to do.{&1310}\par I felt whatever courage was left go with her and was suddenly vastly alone in this alien world on the officers' deck.{&1310}\par "Now, listen to me, Weir," Morisant started once my eyes had stopped trailing Komi out of the sides and were forlornly back on him. I kept it from my face, however, hiding behind my position at attention. "You will be as respectful with the Commander as you have been with me -- with any officer in uniform you might have seen about decks. You will not speak unless asked a question, and you will be clear and brief when you respond. Do you understand?"{&1310}\par "A-aye, sir."{&1310}\par "Do you understand me, Cadet?"{&1310}\par "Aye, sir," I repeated, forcing it out raggedly this time.{&1310}\par He studied me for a few more seconds. It was hard not to shake in my service boots under that heavy stare. I lost myself in wonder about what sort of abilities he might have had and been hiding from us this whole time, but my face was a wooden mask. I think he could see past it, but it was enough that I had learned how to wear it like plastic under pressure. It was enough, and it was all I had left.{&1310}\par "Stay behind and to my left as we enter," he told me, "and then stay put until you are dismissed. Understood, Cadet?"{&1310}\par "Aye, sir."{&1310}\par The lieutenant turned back toward the door he'd been standing in front of, flashed a hand to the panel beside it, and swept me inside as it opened. His step was crisp and brisk and military, and I suddenly felt so much more nervous stepping into the unknown that I was sure I would trip over myself as I plodded along dutifully after. I didn't, somehow. I even managed to stop behind him in time as he came to stand before a spartan-looking workstation with a man that couldn't have been much older than me sitting behind it with his thumb in his mouth and watching several viewscreens. He looked up at Morisant.{&1310}\par "Lieutenant," the other man acknowledged with a slow, unimpressed tone that held some underlying meaning in it that I couldn't follow in my currently piqued state. I did have enough awareness to recognize that the man was the same rank by the pips on his stiff collar. But somehow, Morisant just seemed so much older.{&1310}\par "Lieutenant," Morisant returned.{&1310}\par "She's waiting," the man told him with that same, pregnant tone. I realized he must have been an adjutant, and the way he said that made me suddenly worry about how \i long\i0  she'd been waiting. I'd only seen the commander once -- hard, cold, with lines on her face that she didn't get from age and haired pulled back so tight I was sure it should've split her head into a rictus grin. She never smiled that I'd seen, though. Not that that was unusual. But her eye was. She'd lost it at some point in her career and there was only a beady-red cybernetic in its place. She'd been short -- barely more than a meter-and-a-half tall -- shorter than me and most of everyone else around her. But that eye ... god, that creepy fucking eye. I swear a few times during her introductory address to us future cadets that it had moved without the other one -- the still flesh-and-blood one.{&1310}\par The adjutant had pressed a button somewhere because a door to our right slipped open of a sudden. At least, I think he pressed a button. This \i was\i0  the academy's command so he could have been a psycho too, and probably was. It was easy to forget that other officers used their talents for mundane tasks like that all the time when Morisant didn't. He used his hands. He \i always\i0  used his hands. I don't know why that sometimes unsettled me even more.{&1310}\par Morisant turned and marched in through that door. I kept close on his heels, remembering to stay just a little behind and to the left until he stopped again. This time, it was in front of a rather large desk with every cadet's nightmare sitting right behind it.{&1310}\par Commander Delacroix.{&1310}\par There had been a creeping terror building in me ever since Morisant had commed into our room back at the squad bay. It had followed us up through the decks and all the way to the lieutenant standing outside this office. I hadn't thought about it. I couldn't \i let\i0  myself think about it. Even now it was hard to come out from hiding and face this tiny woman with her piercing red robotic eye. It wasn't on me yet, though.{&1310}\par "This is not standard procedure," Morisant was saying. For the moment, the commander's attention was totally on him and I started desperately trying to get my head back together now that I was finally here. "I want that noted."{&1310}\par "It's noted.{&1310}\par "If you'll please. Lieutenant."{&1310}\par The commander showed him the way to stand aside with a hand that was gloved to the wrist in immaculate black. He did. Then the moment I'd been secretly dreading before I'd even become aware of it but somewhere only recognized deep down when Morisant first said her name over the comm -- came.{&1310}\par Commander Delacroix turned to me.{&1310}\par "Cadet -- Evelyn -- Weir."{&1310}\par She enunciated each word in careful, clipped tones. If I'd expected some sort of fanfare when she looked at me like the sudden realization of all my fears and doubts as a cadet pulverizing me to dust there in her office ... I was disappointed. Instead there was just this feeling like being a tiny insect that had been put under a scope for disection -- some unintelligible assurance in the back of my head that I'd just been judged and found grossly inadequate. That everything I was was small, weak, and utterly insignificant in the grand schemes of this woman sitting with her hands steepled in mock-thought with me in front of her.{&1310}\par And that creepy, \i fucking\i0  eye.{&1310}\par "Twenty-three years old. Port of origin: Riftwatch Station research center. Father: Doctor Nolan Weir, rear admiral, retired. Mother: Doctor Evelyn Weir, deceased."{&1310}\par She started itemizing me in smooth, soft tones that were almost disarming. Indifferently casual. But not if you looked in her eyes. --\i Eye\i0 . It was dead cold, mirroring the other, and I didn't want to look at it anymore. I just stared straight ahead, right over the top of her screwed-tight bun.{&1310}\par "For someone of your father's reputation" -- she grasped a datapad in her hand that must have had my record on it, but only spared it a flick of her living eye -- "I expected a much more impressive performance report." Her hand brushed the pad aside. I got the distinct impression that she already knew my entire story by heart for some reason. Why -- I had \i no\i0  idea.{&1310}\par "Is that why I'm here, ma'am?" I asked of a sudden. "Poor performance?" It was a miracle I didn't choke on my words but I still had to squeeze them out in a rush to avoid sounding terrified and hoarse. It was stupid and Morisant had warned me not to speak unless she asked me a question. But I had to know. There was no reason to call a shitty cadet into the commander's office like this and the why had eaten away at me the whole way as much as the fear. Stupid. I had to resist the urge not to swallow, my tongue was so thick in my throat.{&1310}\par The commander spared a brief glance for Morisant standing at parade rest to one side of her desk at a respectful distance. Or was it wary?{&1310}\par "You are here, cadet," she started slowly, "because of your poor performance, yes." And then she began to itemize me there, too. In alphabetical order.{&1310}\par "Applied Physics: eighty-five percent efficiency.{&1310}\par "Combat Theory: seventy-four percent efficiency.{&1310}\par "Hand-to-Hand Combat: ninety-two percent efficiency.{&1310}\par "Historical Events: eighty-two percent efficiency.{&1310}\par "Leadership: sixty-two percent efficiency.{&1310}\par "System Politics: seventy-seven percent efficiency."{&1310}\par And, finally, she came to the last and most important one of all.{&1310}\par "Psychokinetic Aptitude ... {&1310}\par "Zero percent."{&1310}\par She paused again, letting that sink into me as I stood there staring off at nothing and just listening. I could feel her cybernetic eye with its bloody red light glaring at me as if the heat would start burning into my skin at any minute. I didn't look at her.{&1310}\par "You realize this is a failing performance, cadet."{&1310}\par It wasn't a question and I didn't bother answering. I just stood there, waiting for what would come next. No one in this room didn't already know all of this and what it meant. I still had no reason to be here.{&1310}\par She studied me for a moment before a small, tight-lipped not-quite-a-smile split her face like that bun had finally started tearing it in two. "You must be wondering why you're here." She leaned back a little and I felt her eyes wander a bit, sizing me up that much more. "We all know your poor performance is a problem -- a problem that is ultimately \i your\i0  responsibility to remediate. This is a proving ground, not strictly training, and the burden is on \i you\i0  to prove yourself to \i us\i0 . Now, there have been a number of cadets that have come back from pre-finals leave to demonstrate their first ever psychokinetic potential. I know that. Lieutenant Morisant knows that. Even \i you\i0  must know that from talking with your fellow cadets. It's part of the reason why we bother having them at all right before your final tests. It's \i not\i0  why you're here in my office.{&1310}\par "Lieutenant," she abruptly called on the man beside her desk who had been completely and dutifully silent this whole time while she was speaking.{&1310}\par "Ma'am." He popped back to life like he'd been turned to stone.{&1310}\par "Wait for your cadet outside, please."{&1310}\par "Ma'am?"{&1310}\par "You heard me," she repeated while she kept her eye locked on me. I could still feel it.{&1310}\par "Ma'am, this is not--"{&1310}\par "Lieutenant." She cut him off just as abruptly as she'd brought him back into the conversation. If I'd had more presence of mind I might have realized he was about to object to what was undoubtedly going to be a private discussion with me, a lowly cadet, and that it was probably against most protocols considering her rank. Or maybe not. A minute or so later I would remember his tone being rather protective, though, as far as Morisant went. Not intrusive. And that should have scared me a hell of a lot more.{&1310}\par As it was, I just waited anxiously there while the lieutenant marched out of her office and the doors slipped silently shut behind him. My body was frozen in place but my mind followed him out like he was my last lifeline back to what had always seemed a hostile and unknown environment but now, ironically, seemed so much more comfortable than this one. And that Lieutenant Morisant would seem like a friendly alternative was only due to how intimidating this tiny little career officer was with her mechanical eye pinning me down for study in front of her. If I'd been smarter, I might have wondered why she could make me so scared and asked what could she possibly do to hurt me other than send me home? Firing squad? Space me for improper ettiquette? No, that wouldn't look good for recruitment. Or maybe they could just make me disappear. Who would ever know? A few lies and I was gone forever. Maybe. Or maybe I was just afraid to get sent back home.{&1310}\par "Do you know how many soldiers I've lost under my command, cadet?"{&1310}\par I came back to awareness of the commander to realize that she was standing right in front of me, looking up at me because she was shorter and somehow making \i me\i0  feel like the small one. Her fine chin was jutting toward my throat like she meant to gouge me with it and that robot eye was glaring at me while the other one scanned my face.{&1310}\par "N-no, ma'am," I somehow managed to say.{&1310}\par "A hundred and forty-six. Do you know how many I regret?"{&1310}\par I shook my head, only realizing too late that that was \i not\i0  how you answered a superior officer. Especially as a cadet. But she seemed not to notice.{&1310}\par "Two. Why?" she asked herself rhetorically. "A rather big and grotesquely-modified mutie from Tau. They like to unleash the freaks on small squads sometimes to see how fast they break, did you know that? Tear through combat armor down to the bone and crack your spin" --she snapped her fingers loudly to one side of my head, making me wince-- "just like that. Luckily for me, this was only one of the intelligent ones I had to deal with. Just four arms filled with firebolts and happy to melt a few faces off my squad before retreating into the vents to take another shot at us later. I hesitated. I was young, didn't know what I was doing, and I hesitated. And two people died because I did.{&1310}\par "I lost my eye to that freak," she said, holding up a gloved hand, "and most of the fingers on this hand. I could have had the eye replaced with a cloned one, and why not?" She pointed at the cybernetic orb in her right socket. "This one's ugly, limited, and often times will hurt where you can't get at it, cadet. But it reminds me of what happens when you're stupid and you make decisions without thinking. Or don't make them at all."{&1310}\par She backed up a step and walked back to her desk.{&1310}\par "It also scares the living shit out of most recruits."{&1310}\par Somehow, I didn't think that was meant to be a joke.{&1310}\par "Project Arclight."{&1310}\par She'd had her back to me for a second. Just a second, and I felt some kind of relief from that onslaught. I almost slumped where I stood it was so exhausting to be so out-of-sorts and completely confused as to what the hell I was even here for and might happen next. Then she was on me again, twisting her head back around.{&1310}\par "Project Arclight, cadet," she repeated, giving me a strange, scrutinizing look. "Tell me what it is."{&1310}\par "What?"{&1310}\par The word came stumbling out of my mouth, stupified.{&1310}\par "Someone is making damn sure you stay in this program no matter what. I'd guess that they'd pull just the right strings to get you to graduate even if you never show a flicker of psychokinetic ability by finals, as impossible as that might be. Not really that unusual considering how many noteworthy candidates we get from influential military and civilian leaders. But this is different. This is borderline obssessive."{&1310}\par She turned fully back around and stared me down again. This time her face was not so much like a cat baiting a puny, ineffectual mouse, but a wolf or a lion or some other big planetary predator with lots of teeth going for the face and throat. \i My\i0  face and throat. It fixed me so hard I was sure she could draw blood with a look.{&1310}\par That mechanical eye twirled around a full three hundred and sixty degrees in its socket like it suddenly had a mind of its own.{&1310}\par "I usually check up on these things because I like to know who's trying to pull my strings. I won't send men and women to their deaths for no reason, cadet, and every cadet I let graduate is \i going\i0  to send people to their deaths. Maybe even cause them, like I did. Usually it's a father, mother, an uncle, grandfather -- something familial. Not in your case, Weir. I dug as deep as I could and my clearance apparently wasn't enough. All I could get on you past Riftwatch was Project Arclight. Now tell me," she ordered. "What is it."{&1310}\par "I don't ..."{&1310}\par I shook my head, and I kept shaking my head at her. On top of everything else, this was suddenly just \i too\i0  much information to process. Project Arclight? What the fuck was that even supposed to \i mean\i0  to me?{&1310}\par "I can't read you, Weir." She was suddenly in my face again and bearing down. Or up. Whatever. It sure felt like down. "I'm strong enough to get stray thoughts and most emotions off of people, but I can't get a single thing off you. I haven't had to use physical tells this much in years. Something's off about you. You're either lying or ignorant and both are deadly. Now tell me or I won't only make sure you don't graduate, but I will personally take you apart piece by bloody piece until I know for sure that you aren't a threat to anyone in Dreggoran space or beyond. If you're part of some fucked up genetic experiment, I better fucking know about it. Do I make myself clear?"{&1310}\par If she was expecting an affirmative or even a nod, all she got was a horrified expression of abject confusion. And maybe that was enough. Her whole posture made me expect some sudden incoming blow -- probably unseen. The material on my uniform had rippled from some invisible hand as she laid into me with that intense look in her eye of animal cunning and merciless cruelty. She looked at me like an enemy. An enemy she didn't understand yet, but she meant to. But she released me so abruptly from her crushing jaws that I nearly fell over flat on my face.{&1310}\par "You think about it, cadet. When you're back home. You think about it. If you come back, I'll expect an answer. If you don't come back ... well. I might just come looking for it myself, eventually.{&1310}\par "Dismissed."\cf2\f1 {&1310}\par }{&1310}

Mother: Doctor Evelyn Weir, deceased."{&1310}\par She started itemizing me in smooth, soft tones that were almost disarming. Indifferently casual. But not if you looked in her eyes. --\i Eye\i0 . It was dead cold, mirroring the other, and I didn't want to look at it anymore. I just stared straight ahead, right over the top of her screwed-tight bun.{&1310}\par "For someone of your father's reputation" -- she grasped a datapad in her hand that must have had my record on it, but only spared it a flick of her living eye -- "I expected a much more impressive performance report." Her hand brushed the pad aside. I got the distinct impression that she already knew my entire story by heart for some reason. Why -- I had \i no\i0  idea.{&1310}\par "Is that why I'm here, ma'am?" I asked of a sudden. "Poor performance?" It was a miracle I didn't choke on my words but I still had to squeeze them out in a rush to avoid sounding terrified and hoarse. It was stupid and Morisant had warned me not to speak unless she asked me a question. But I had to know. There was no reason to call a shitty cadet into the commander's office like this and the why had eaten away at me the whole way as much as the fear. Stupid. I had to resist the urge not to swallow, my tongue was so thick in my throat.{&1310}\par The commander spared a brief glance for Morisant standing at parade rest to one side of her desk at a respectful distance. Or was it wary?{&1310}\par "You are here, cadet," she started slowly, "because of your poor performance, yes." And then she began to itemize me there, too. In alphabetical order.{&1310}\par "Applied Physics: eighty-five percent efficiency.{&1310}\par "Combat Theory: seventy-four percent efficiency.{&1310}\par "Hand-to-Hand Combat: ninety-two percent efficiency.{&1310}\par "Historical Events: eighty-two percent efficiency.{&1310}\par "Leadership: sixty-two percent efficiency.{&1310}\par "System Politics: seventy-seven percent efficiency."{&1310}\par And, finally, she came to the last and most important one of all.{&1310}\par "Psychokinetic Aptitude ... {&1310}\par "Zero percent."{&1310}\par She paused again, letting that sink into me as I stood there staring off at nothing and just listening. I could feel her cybernetic eye with its bloody red light glaring at me as if the heat would start burning into my skin at any minute. I didn't look at her.{&1310}\par "You realize this is a failing performance, cadet."{&1310}\par It wasn't a question and I didn't bother answering. I just stood there, waiting for what would come next. No one in this room didn't already know all of this and what it meant. I still had no reason to be here.{&1310}\par She studied me for a moment before a small, tight-lipped not-quite-a-smile split her face like that bun had finally started tearing it in two. "You must be wondering why you're here." She leaned back a little and I felt her eyes wander a bit, sizing me up that much more. "We all know your poor performance is a problem -- a problem that is ultimately \i your\i0  responsibility to remediate. This is a proving ground, not strictly training, and the burden is on \i you\i0  to prove yourself to \i us\i0 . Now, there have been a number of cadets that have come back from pre-finals leave to demonstrate their first ever psychokinetic potential. I know that. Lieutenant Morisant knows that. Even \i you\i0  must know that from talking with your fellow cadets. It's part of the reason why we bother having them at all right before your final tests. It's \i not\i0  why you're here in my office.{&1310}\par "Lieutenant," she abruptly called on the man beside her desk who had been completely and dutifully silent this whole time while she was speaking.{&1310}\par "Ma'am." He popped back to life like he'd been turned to stone.{&1310}\par "Wait for your cadet outside, please."{&1310}\par "Ma'am?"{&1310}\par "You heard me," she repeated while she kept her eye locked on me. I could still feel it.{&1310}\par "Ma'am, this is not--"{&1310}\par "Lieutenant." She cut him off just as abruptly as she'd brought him back into the conversation. If I'd had more presence of mind I might have realized he was about to object to what was undoubtedly going to be a private discussion with me, a lowly cadet, and that it was probably against most protocols considering her rank. Or maybe not. A minute or so later I would remember his tone being rather protective, though, as far as Morisant went. Not intrusive. And that should have scared me a hell of a lot more.{&1310}\par As it was, I just waited anxiously there while the lieutenant marched out of her office and the doors slipped silently shut behind him. My body was frozen in place but my mind followed him out like he was my last lifeline back to what had always seemed a hostile and unknown environment but now, ironically, seemed so much more comfortable than this one. And that Lieutenant Morisant would seem like a friendly alternative was only due to how intimidating this tiny little career officer was with her mechanical eye pinning me down for study in front of her. If I'd been smarter, I might have wondered why she could make me so scared and asked what could she possibly do to hurt me other than send me home? Firing squad? Space me for improper ettiquette? No, that wouldn't look good for recruitment. Or maybe they could just make me disappear. Who would ever know? A few lies and I was gone forever. Maybe. Or maybe I was just afraid to get sent back home.{&1310}\par "Do you know how many soldiers I've lost under my command, cadet?"{&1310}\par I came back to awareness of the commander to realize that she was standing right in front of me, looking up at me because she was shorter and somehow making \i me\i0  feel like the small one. Her fine chin was jutting toward my throat like she meant to gouge me with it and that robot eye was glaring at me while the other one scanned my face.{&1310}\par "N-no, ma'am," I somehow managed to say.{&1310}\par "A hundred and forty-six. Do you know how many I regret?"{&1310}\par I shook my head, only realizing too late that that was \i not\i0  how you answered a superior officer. Especially as a cadet. But she seemed not to notice.{&1310}\par "Two. Why?" she asked herself rhetorically. "A rather big and grotesquely-modified mutie from Tau. They like to unleash the freaks on small squads sometimes to see how fast they break, did you know that? Tear through combat armor down to the bone and crack your spin" --she snapped her fingers loudly to one side of my head, making me wince-- "just like that. Luckily for me, this was only one of the intelligent ones I had to deal with. Just four arms filled with firebolts and happy to melt a few faces off my squad before retreating into the vents to take another shot at us later. I hesitated. I was young, didn't know what I was doing, and I hesitated. And two people died because I did.{&1310}\par "I lost my eye to that freak," she said, holding up a gloved hand, "and most of the fingers on this hand. I could have had the eye replaced with a cloned one, and why not?" She pointed at the cybernetic orb in her right socket. "This one's ugly, limited, and often times will hurt where you can't get at it, cadet. But it reminds me of what happens when you're stupid and you make decisions without thinking. Or don't make them at all."{&1310}\par She backed up a step and walked back to her desk.{&1310}\par "It also scares the living shit out of most recruits."{&1310}\par Somehow, I didn't think that was meant to be a joke.{&1310}\par "Project Arclight."{&1310}\par She'd had her back to me for a second. Just a second, and I felt some kind of relief from that onslaught. I almost slumped where I stood it was so exhausting to be so out-of-sorts and completely confused as to what the hell I was even here for and might happen next. Then she was on me again, twisting her head back around.{&1310}\par "Project Arclight, cadet," she repeated, giving me a strange, scrutinizing look. "Tell me what it is."{&1310}\par "What?"{&1310}\par The word came stumbling out of my mouth, stupified.{&1310}\par "Someone is making damn sure you stay in this program no matter what. I'd guess that they'd pull just the right strings to get you to graduate even if you never show a flicker of psychokinetic ability by finals, as impossible as that might be. Not really that unusual considering how many noteworthy candidates we get from influential military and civilian leaders. But this is different. This is borderline obssessive."{&1310}\par She turned fully back around and stared me down again. This time her face was not so much like a cat baiting a puny, ineffectual mouse, but a wolf or a lion or some other big planetary predator with lots of teeth going for the face and throat. \i My\i0  face and throat. It fixed me so hard I was sure she could draw blood with a look.{&1310}\par That mechanical eye twirled around a full three hundred and sixty degrees in its socket like it suddenly had a mind of its own.{&1310}\par "I usually check up on these things because I like to know who's trying to pull my strings. I won't send men and women to their deaths for no reason, cadet, and every cadet I let graduate is \i going\i0  to send people to their deaths. Maybe even cause them, like I did. Usually it's a father, mother, an uncle, grandfather -- something familial. Not in your case, Weir. I dug as deep as I could and my clearance apparently wasn't enough. All I could get on you past Riftwatch was Project Arclight. Now tell me," she ordered. "What is it."{&1310}\par "I don't ..."{&1310}\par I shook my head, and I kept shaking my head at her. On top of everything else, this was suddenly just \i too\i0  much information to process. Project Arclight? What the fuck was that even supposed to \i mean\i0  to me?{&1310}\par "I can't read you, Weir." She was suddenly in my face again and bearing down. Or up. Whatever. It sure felt like down. "I'm strong enough to get stray thoughts and most emotions off of people, but I can't get a single thing off you. I haven't had to use physical tells this much in years. Something's off about you. You're either lying or ignorant and both are deadly. Now tell me or I won't only make sure you don't graduate, but I will personally take you apart piece by bloody piece until I know for sure that you aren't a threat to anyone in Dreggoran space or beyond. If you're part of some fucked up genetic experiment, I better fucking know about it. Do I make myself clear?"{&1310}\par If she was expecting an affirmative or even a nod, all she got was a horrified expression of abject confusion. And maybe that was enough. Her whole posture made me expect some sudden incoming blow -- probably unseen. The material on my uniform had rippled from some invisible hand as she laid into me with that intense look in her eye of animal cunning and merciless cruelty. She looked at me like an enemy. An enemy she didn't understand yet, but she meant to. But she released me so abruptly from her crushing jaws that I nearly fell over flat on my face.{&1310}\par "You think about it, cadet. When you're back home. You think about it. If you come back, I'll expect an answer. If you don't come back ... well. I might just come looking for it myself, eventually.{&1310}\par "Dismissed."\cf2\f1 {&1310}\par }{&1310}

There was nothing else for her to do.{&1310}\par I felt that little bit of courage go with her and was suddenly vastly alone in this alien world on the officers' deck.{&1310}\par "Now, listen to me, Weir," Morisant started once my eyes had stopped trailing Komi out of the sides and were forlornly back on him. I kept it from my face, however, hiding behind my position at attention. "You will be as respectful with the Commander as you have been with me -- with any officer in uniform you might have seen about decks. You will not speak unless asked a question, and you will be clear and brief when you respond. Do you understand?"{&1310}\par "A-aye, sir."{&1310}\par "Do you understand me, Cadet?"{&1310}\par "Aye, sir," I repeated, forcing it out raggedly this time.{&1310}\par He studied me for a few more seconds. It was hard not to shake in my service boots under that heavy stare. I lost myself in wonder about what sort of abilities he might have had and been hiding from us this whole time, but my face was a wooden mask. I think he could see past it, but it was enough that I had learned how to wear it like plastic under pressure. It was enough.{&1310}\par "Stay behind and to my left as we enter," he told me, "and then stay put until you are dismissed. Understood, Cadet?"{&1310}\par "Aye, sir."{&1310}\par The lieutenant turned back toward the door he'd been standing in front of, flashed a hand to the panel beside it, and swept me inside as it opened. His step was crisp and brisk and military, and I suddenly felt so much more nervous stepping into the unknown that I was sure I would trip over myself as I plodded along dutifully after. I didn't, somehow. I even managed to stop behind him in time as he came to stand before a spartan-looking workstation with a man that couldn't have been much older than me sitting behind it with his thumb in his mouth and watching several viewscreens. He looked up at Morisant.{&1310}\par "Lieutenant," the other man acknowledged with a slow, unimpressed tone that held some underlying meaning in it that I couldn't follow in my piqued state. I did have enough awareness to recognize that the man was also an O-3 by the pips on his stiff collar.{&1310}\par "Lieutenant," Morisant returned.{&1310}\par "She's waiting," the man told him with that same, pregnant tone. I realized he must have been an adjutant, and the way he said that made me suddenly worry about how \i long\i0  she'd been waiting. I'd only seen the commander once -- hard, cold, with lines on her face that she didn't get from age and haired pulled back so tight I was sure it should've split her face in a rictus grin. She never smiled, though. Not that that was unusual. But her eye was. She'd lost it at some point in her career and there was only a beady-red cybernetic in its place. She'd been short -- barely more than a meter-and-a-half tall -- shorter than me and most of everyone else around her. But that eye ... god, that creepy fucking eye. I swear sometimes it moved without the other one -- the still flesh-and-blood one.{&1310}\par The adjutant had pressed a button somewhere because a door to our right slipped open of a sudden. At least, I think he pressed a button. This \i was\i0  the academy's command so he could have been a psycho too, and probably was. It was easy to forget that other officers used their talents for mundane tasks all the time when Morisant didn't. He used his hands. He \i always\i0  used his hands. I don't know why that sometimes unsettled me even more.{&1310}\par Morisant turned and marched in through that door. I kept close on his heels, remembering to stay just a little behind and to the left until he stopped again. This time, it was in front of a rather large desk with a cadet's nightmare sitting right behind it.{&1310}\par Commander Delacroix.{&1310}\par There had been a creeping terror building in me ever since Morisant had commed into our room back at the squad bay. It had followed up up through the decks and all the way to the lieutenant standing outside this office. I hadn't thought about. I couldn't \i let\i0  myself think about it. Even now it was hard to come out from hiding and face this tiny woman with her piercing red robot eye. It wasn't on me yet, though.{&1310}\par "This is not standard procedure," Morisant was saying. For the moment, the commander's attention was totally on him and I started desperately trying to get my head back together now that I was finally here. "I want that noted. "{&1310}\par "It's noted.{&1310}\par "If you'll please. Lieutenant."{&1310}\par The commander showed him the way to stand aside with a hand that was gloved to the wrist in immaculate black. He did. Then the moment I'd been secretly dreading before I'd even become aware of it but somewhere only recognized deep downw hen Morisant first said her name over the comm -- came.{&1310}\par Commander Delacroix turned to me.{&1310}\par "Cadet -- Evelyn -- Weir."{&1310}\par She enunciated each word in careful, clipped tones. If I'd expected smoe sort of fanfare whens he looked at me like the sudden realization of all my fears and doubts as a cadet pulverizing me to dust there in her office, I was disappointed. Instead there was just this feeling like being a tiny insect that had been put under a scope for disection -- some unintelligible assurance in the back of my head that I'd just been judged and found grossly inadequate, that everything I was was small, weak, and utterly insignificant in the grand schemes of this woman sitting with her hands steepled in mock-thought with me in front of her.{&1310}\par And that creepy, \i fucking\i0  eye.{&1310}\par "Twenty-three years old.

I asked of a sudden. "Poor performance?" It was a miracle I didn't choke on my words but I still had to squeeze them out in a rush to avoid sounding terrified and hoarse. It was stupid and Morisant had warned me not to speak unless she asked me a question. But I had to know. There was no reason to call a shitty cadet into the commander's office like this and the why had eaten away at me the whole way as much as the fear. Stupid. I had to resist the urge not to swallow, my tongue was so thick in my throat.{&1310}\par The commander spared a brief glance for Morisant standing at parade rest to one side of her desk at a respectful distance. Or was it wary?{&1310}\par "You are here, cadet," she started slowly, "because of your poor performance, yes." And then she began to itemize me there, too.

I didn't look at her.{&1310}\par "You realize this is a failing performance, cadet."{&1310}\par It wasn't a question and I didn't bother answering. I just stood there, waiting for what would come next. No one in this room didn't already know all of this and what it meant. I still had no reason to be here.{&1310}\par She studied me for a moment before a small, tight-lipped smile split her face like that bun had finally started tearing it in two. "You must be wondering why you're here." She leaned back a little and I felt her eyes wander a bit, sizing me up that much more. "We all know your poor performance is a problem -- a problem that is ultimately \i your\i0  responsibility to remediate. This is a proving ground, not strictly training, and the burden is on \i you\i0  to prove yourself to \i us\i0 .

Or maybe not. A minute or so later I would remember his tone being rather protective, though, as far as Morisant went. Not intrusive. And that should have scared me a lot more.{&1310}\par As it was, I just waited anxiously there while the lieutenant marched out of her office and the doors slipped silently shut behind him. My body was frozen in place but my mind followed him out like he was my last lifeline back to what had always seemed a hostile and unknown environment but now, ironically, seemed so much more comfortable than this one. And that Lieutenant Morisant would seem like a friendly alternative was only due to how intimidating this tiny little officer was with her mechanical eye pinning me down for study in front of her. If I'd been smarter, I might have wondered why she could make me so scared and asked what could she possibly do to hurt me other than send me home? Firing squad? Space me for improper ettiquette? No, that wouldn't look good for recruitment. Or maybe they could just make me disappear. Who would ever know? A few lies and I was gone forever. Maybe. Or maybe I was just afraid to get sent back home.{&1310}\par "Do you know how many soldiers I've lost under my command, cadet?"{&1310}\par I came back to awareness of the commander to realize that she was standing right in front of me, looking up at me because she was shorter and somehow making \i me\i0  feel like the small one. Her fine chin was jutting toward my throat like she meant to gouge me with it and that robot eye was glaring at me while the other one scanned my face.{&1310}\par "N-no, ma'am," I somehow managed to say.{&1310}\par "A hundred and forty-six. Do you know how many I regret?"{&1310}\par I shook my head, only realizing too late that that was \i not\i0  how you answered a superior officer. Especially as a cadet. But she seemed not to notice.{&1310}\par "Two. Why?" she asked herself rhetorically. "A rather big and grotesquely-modified mutie from Tau. They like to unleash the freaks on small squads sometimes to see how fast they break, did you know that? Tear through combat armor down to the bone and crack your spin" --she snapped her fingers loudly to one side of my head, making me wince-- "just like that. Luckily for me, this was one of the intelligent ones I had to deal with. Just four arms filled with firebolts and happy to melt a few faces off my squad before retreating into the vents to take another shot at us later. I hesitated. I was young, didn't know what I was doing, and I hesitated. And two people died because I did.{&1310}\par "I lost my eye to that freak," she said, holding up a gloved hand, "and most of the fingers on this hand. I could have had the eye replaced with a cloned one, and why not?" She pointed at the cybernetic orb in her right socket. "This one's ugly, limited, and often times will hurt where you can't get at it, cadet. But it reminds me of what happens when you're stupid and you make decisions without thinking. Or don't make them at all."{&1310}\par She backed up a step and walked back to her desk.{&1310}\par "It also scares the living shit out of most recruits."{&1310}\par Somehow, I didn't think that was meant to be a joke.{&1310}\par "Project Arclight."{&1310}\par She'd had her back to me for a second. Just a second, and I felt some kind of relief from that onslaught. I almost slumped where I stood it was so exhausting to be so out-of-sorts and completely confused as to what the hell I was even here for and might happen next. Then she was on me again, twisting her head back around.{&1310}\par "Project Arclight, cadet," she repeated, giving me a strange, scrutinizing look. "Tell me what it is."{&1310}\par "What?"{&1310}\par The word came stumbling out of my mouth, stupified.{&1310}\par "Someone is making damn sure you stay in this program no matter what.

Not really that unusual considering how many noteworthy candidates we get from influential military and civilian leaders. But this is different. This is borderline obssessive."{&1310}\par She turned fully back around and stared me down again. This time her face was not so much like a cat baiting a puny, ineffectual mouse, but a wolf or a lion or some other big predator with lots of teeth going for the face and throat. \i My\i0  face and throat. It fixed me so hard I was sure she could draw blood with a look.{&1310}\par That mechanical eye twirled around a full three hundred and sixty degrees in its socket like it suddenly had a mind of its own.{&1310}\par "I usually check up on these things because I like to know who's trying to pull my strings. I won't send men and women to their deaths for no reason, cadet, and every cadet I let graduate is \i going\i0  to send people to their deaths. Maybe even cause them, like I did. Usually it's a father, mother, an uncle, grandfather -- something familial. Not in your case, Weir. I dug as deep as I could and my clearance apparently wasn't enough. All I could get on you past Riftwatch was Project Arclight. Now tell me," she ordered. "What is it."{&1310}\par "I don't ..."{&1310}\par I shook my head, and I kept shaking my head at her. On top of everything else, this was suddenly just \i too\i0  much information to process. Project Arclight? What the fuck was that even supposed to \i mean\i0  to me?{&1310}\par "I can't read you, Weir." She was suddenly in my face again and bearing down. Or up. Whatever. It sure felt like down. "I'm strong enough to get stray thoughts and most emotions off of people, but I can't get a single thing off you. I haven't had to use physical tells this much in years. Something's off about you. You're either lying or ignorant and both are deadly. Now tell me or I won't only make sure you don't graduate, but I will personally take you apart piece by bloody piece until I know for sure that you aren't a threat to anyone in Dreggoran space or beyond. If you're part of some fucked up genetic experiment, I better fucking know about it. Do I make myself clear?"{&1310}\par If she was expecting an affirmative or even a nod, all she got was a horrified expression of abject confusion. And maybe that was enough. Her whole posture made me expect some sudden incoming blow -- probably unseen. The material on my uniform had rippled from some invisible hand as she laid into me with that intense look in her eye of animal cunning and merciless cruelty. She looked at me like an enemy. An enemy she didn't understand yet, but she meant to. But she released me so abruptly from her crushing jaws that I nearly fell over flat on my face.{&1310}\par "You think about it, cadet.

I hadn't been up here since in-processing, filtering in with all the other raw recruits brave, reckless, or stupid enough to sign their life away to the Grand Admirals and the Dreggoran Navy. There was a moment then when the knowing of had finally caught up with me. Up until that point, it had felt like a dream -- a distant possibility that couldn't really change things so much but would just \i happen\i0  eventually. Fear had settled over me like a cold blanket being drawn up by unseen hands and I'd looked around at everyone else, noticing that same dawning realization mirrored back on their faces. {&1310}\par What the hell was I thinking? What have I gotten myself into?{&1310}\par I'd been just a civilian back then. Frightened. Alone. Vulnerable. We all had been. Now we were trainees and cadets, and it seemed like a lifetime ago. Like it had been someone else who had done it. Not me.{&1310}\par I remembered Komi from back then. Aloof, but not like I had been with so many civilians I hadn't grown up around suddenly jostling around me. Recruitment campaigns were effective, and everyone hated what the pirates were doing. Komi had joined because she wanted to do something about it. She had been sure of herself even back then, though it was a quieter and less vetted confidence in herself. I'd barely paid her any mind until we were suddenly rackmates. I had joined because of dad.{&1310}\par They'd called Komi up here a few times -- for good reasons -- so she mostly knew the way. Escorting me wasn't quite the right way to think about it since we weren't supposed to go anywhere without at least one other person and certainly not to the officers' decks. We got stopped almost every five steps, offering a perfunctory salute to some crewman or naval officer wanting to know what we were even doing there. Cadets were usually escorted by their training officer. Morisant didn't meet us until we were right outside the commander's office.{&1310}\par "Cadets Kominshk and Weir, reporting as ordered, sir," Komi stated formally for the both of us. Only one of us had to.{&1310}\par "Cadets," he acknowledged us crisply, but didn't return our respectful salute. Active service members didn't have to do that onboard a ship. We did. {&1310}\par Conditioning.{&1310}\par "Kominshk."{&1310}\par "Aye, sir?"{&1310}\par "You're dismissed, cadet. Head back to the squad bay."{&1310}\par Komi glanced at me out of the corner of her eye, but she didn't object about being sent back alone instead of being told to wait. Not to an officer. Not to Morisant. It was strange, and a whole bunch of worries started crowding back in my head along with that creeping sensation that something was wrong. Something more than just my poor scores. Komi must have thought that too because she hesitated for an almost imperceptible fraction of a second. I wouldn't even have noticed if I hadn't been looking for it since the idea of being left alone was so suddenly more terrifying than even coming here in the first place. But then she was about-facing and marching away toward the lifts back down to our squad bay's deck. There was nothing else for her to do.{&1310}\par I felt whatever courage was left go with her and was suddenly vastly alone in this alien world on the officers' deck.{&1310}\par "Now, listen to me, Weir," Morisant started once my eyes had stopped trailing Komi out of the sides and were forlornly back on him. I kept it from my face, however, hiding behind my position at attention. "You will be as respectful with the Commander as you have been with me -- with any officer in uniform you might have seen about decks. You will not speak unless asked a question, and you will be clear and brief when you respond. Do you understand?"{&1310}\par "A-aye, sir."{&1310}\par "Do you understand me, Cadet?"{&1310}\par "Aye, sir," I repeated, forcing it out raggedly this time.{&1310}\par He studied me for a few more seconds. It was hard not to shake in my service boots under that heavy stare. I lost myself in wonder about what sort of abilities he might have had and been hiding from us this whole time, but my face was a wooden mask. I think he could see past it, but it was enough that I had learned how to wear it like plastic under pressure. It was enough, and it was all I had left.{&1310}\par "Stay behind and to my left as we enter," he told me, "and then stay put until you are dismissed. Understood, Cadet?"{&1310}\par "Aye, sir."{&1310}\par The lieutenant turned back toward the door he'd been standing in front of, flashed a hand to the panel beside it, and swept me inside as it opened. His step was crisp and brisk and military, and I suddenly felt so much more nervous stepping into the unknown that I was sure I would trip over myself as I plodded along dutifully after. I didn't, somehow. I even managed to stop behind him in time as he came to stand before a spartan-looking workstation with a man that couldn't have been much older than me sitting behind it with his thumb in his mouth and watching several viewscreens. He looked up at Morisant.{&1310}\par "Lieutenant," the other man acknowledged with a slow, unimpressed tone that held some underlying meaning in it that I couldn't follow in my currently piqued state. I did have enough awareness to recognize that the man was the same rank by the pips on his stiff collar. But somehow, Morisant just seemed so much older.{&1310}\par "Lieutenant," Morisant returned.{&1310}\par "She's waiting," the man told him with that same, pregnant tone. I realized he must have been an adjutant, and the way he said that made me suddenly worry about how \i long\i0  she'd been waiting. I'd only seen the commander once -- hard, cold, with lines on her face that she didn't get from age and haired pulled back so tight I was sure it should've split her head into a rictus grin. She never smiled that I'd seen, though. Not that that was unusual. But her eye was. She'd lost it at some point in her career and there was only a beady-red cybernetic in its place. She'd been short -- barely more than a meter-and-a-half tall -- shorter than me and most of everyone else around her. But that eye ... god, that creepy fucking eye. I swear a few times during her introductory address to us future cadets that it had moved without the other one -- the still flesh-and-blood one.{&1310}\par The adjutant had pressed a button somewhere because a door to our right slipped open of a sudden. At least, I think he pressed a button. This \i was\i0  the academy's command so he could have been a psycho too, and probably was. It was easy to forget that other officers used their talents for mundane tasks like that all the time when Morisant didn't. He used his hands. He \i always\i0  used his hands. I don't know why that sometimes unsettled me even more.{&1310}\par Morisant turned and marched in through that door. I kept close on his heels, remembering to stay just a little behind and to the left until he stopped again. This time, it was in front of a rather large desk with every cadet's nightmare sitting right behind it.{&1310}\par Commander Delacroix.{&1310}\par There had been a creeping terror building in me ever since Morisant had commed into our room back at the squad bay. It had followed us up through the decks and all the way to the lieutenant standing outside this office. I hadn't thought about it. I couldn't \i let\i0  myself think about it. Even now it was hard to come out from hiding and face this tiny woman with her piercing red robotic eye. It wasn't on me yet, though.{&1310}\par "This is not standard procedure," Morisant was saying. For the moment, the commander's attention was totally on him and I started desperately trying to get my head back together now that I was finally here. "I want that noted."{&1310}\par "It's noted.{&1310}\par "If you'll please. Lieutenant."{&1310}\par The commander showed him the way to stand aside with a hand that was gloved to the wrist in immaculate black. He did. Then the moment I'd been secretly dreading before I'd even become aware of it but somewhere only recognized deep down when Morisant first said her name over the comm -- came.{&1310}\par Commander Delacroix turned to me.{&1310}\par "Cadet -- Evelyn -- Weir."{&1310}\par She enunciated each word in careful, clipped tones. If I'd expected some sort of fanfare when she looked at me like the sudden realization of all my fears and doubts as a cadet pulverizing me to dust there in her office ... I was disappointed. Instead there was just this feeling like being a tiny insect that had been put under a scope for disection -- some unintelligible assurance in the back of my head that I'd just been judged and found grossly inadequate. That everything I was was small, weak, and utterly insignificant in the grand schemes of this woman sitting with her hands steepled in mock-thought with me in front of her.{&1310}\par And that creepy, \i fucking\i0  eye.{&1310}\par "Twenty-three years old. Port of origin: Riftwatch Station research center. Father: Doctor Nolan Weir, rear admiral, retired. Mother: Doctor Evelyn Weir, deceased."{&1310}\par She started itemizing me in smooth, soft tones that were almost disarming. Indifferently casual. But not if you looked in her eyes. --\i Eye\i0 . It was dead cold, mirroring the other, and I didn't want to look at it anymore. I just stared straight ahead, right over the top of her screwed-tight bun.{&1310}\par "For someone of your father's reputation" -- she grasped a datapad in her hand that must have had my record on it, but only spared it a flick of her living eye -- "I expected a much more impressive performance report." Her hand brushed the pad aside. I got the distinct impression that she already knew my entire story by heart for some reason. Why -- I had \i no\i0  idea.{&1310}\par "Is that why I'm here, ma'am?" I asked of a sudden. "Poor performance?" It was a miracle I didn't choke on my words but I still had to squeeze them out in a rush to avoid sounding terrified and hoarse. It was stupid and Morisant had warned me not to speak unless she asked me a question. But I had to know. There was no reason to call a shitty cadet into the commander's office like this and the why had eaten away at me the whole way as much as the fear. Stupid. I had to resist the urge not to swallow, my tongue was so thick in my throat.{&1310}\par The commander spared a brief glance for Morisant standing at parade rest to one side of her desk at a respectful distance. Or was it wary?{&1310}\par "You are here, cadet," she started slowly, "because of your poor performance, yes." And then she began to itemize me there, too. In alphabetical order.{&1310}\par "Applied Physics: eighty-five percent efficiency.{&1310}\par "Combat Theory: seventy-four percent efficiency.{&1310}\par "Hand-to-Hand Combat: ninety-two percent efficiency.{&1310}\par "Historical Events: eighty-two percent efficiency.{&1310}\par "Leadership: sixty-two percent efficiency.{&1310}\par "System Politics: seventy-seven percent efficiency."{&1310}\par And, finally, she came to the last and most important one of all.{&1310}\par "Psychokinetic Aptitude ... {&1310}\par "Zero percent."{&1310}\par She paused again, letting that sink into me as I stood there staring off at nothing and just listening. I could feel her cybernetic eye with its bloody red light glaring at me as if the heat would start burning into my skin at any minute. I didn't look at her.{&1310}\par "You realize this is a failing performance, cadet."{&1310}\par It wasn't a question and I didn't bother answering. I just stood there, waiting for what would come next. No one in this room didn't already know all of this and what it meant. I still had no reason to be here.{&1310}\par She studied me for a moment before a small, tight-lipped not-quite-a-smile split her face like that bun had finally started tearing it in two. "You must be wondering why you're here." She leaned back a little and I felt her eyes wander a bit, sizing me up that much more. "We all know your poor performance is a problem -- a problem that is ultimately \i your\i0  responsibility to remediate. This is a proving ground, not strictly training, and the burden is on \i you\i0  to prove yourself to \i us\i0 .

It's \i not\i0  why you're here in my office.{&1310}\par "Lieutenant," she abruptly called on the man beside her desk who had been completely and dutifully silent this whole time while she was speaking.{&1310}\par "Ma'am." He popped back to life like he'd been turned to stone.{&1310}\par "Wait for your cadet outside, please."{&1310}\par "Ma'am?"{&1310}\par "You heard me," she repeated while she kept her eye locked on me.

Or maybe I was just afraid to get sent back home.{&1310}\par "Do you know how many soldiers I've lost under my command, cadet?"{&1310}\par I came back to awareness of the commander to realize that she was standing right in front of me, looking up at me because she was shorter and somehow making \i me\i0  feel like the small one. Her fine chin was jutting toward my throat like she meant to gouge me with it and that robot eye was glaring at me while the other one scanned my face.{&1310}\par "N-no, ma'am," I somehow managed to say.{&1310}\par "A hundred and forty-six.

Fear had settled over me like a cold blanket being drawn up by unseen hands and I'd looked around at everyone else, noticing that same dawning realization mirrored back on their faces. {&1310}\par What the hell was I thinking? What have I gotten myself into?{&1310}\par I'd been just a civilian back then. Frightened. Alone. Vulnerable. We all had been. Now we were trainees and cadets, and it seemed like a lifetime ago. Like it had been someone else who had done it. Not me.{&1310}\par I remembered Komi from back then. Aloof, but not like I had been with so many civilians I hadn't grown up around suddenly jostling around me. Recruitment campaigns were effective, and everyone hated what the pirates were doing. Komi had joined because she wanted to do something about it. She had been sure of herself even back then, though it was a quieter and less vetted confidence in herself. I'd barely paid her any mind until we were suddenly rackmates. I had joined because of dad.{&1310}\par They'd called Komi up here a few times -- for good reasons -- so she mostly knew the way. Escorting me wasn't quite the right way to think about it since we weren't supposed to go anywhere without at least one other person and certainly not to the officers' decks. We got stopped almost every five steps, offering a perfunctory salute to some crewman or naval officer wanting to know what we were even doing there. Cadets were usually escorted by their training officer. Morisant didn't meet us until we were right outside the commander's office.{&1310}\par "Cadets Kominshk and Weir, reporting as ordered, sir," Komi stated formally for the both of us. Only one of us had to.{&1310}\par "Cadets," he acknowledged us crisply, but didn't return our respectful salute. Active service members didn't have to do that onboard a ship. We did. {&1310}\par Conditioning.{&1310}\par "Kominshk."{&1310}\par "Aye, sir?"{&1310}\par "You're dismissed, cadet. Head back to the squad bay."{&1310}\par Komi glanced at me out of the corner of her eye, but she didn't object about being sent back alone instead of being told to wait. Not to an officer. Not to Morisant. It was strange, and a whole bunch of worries started crowding back in my head along with that creeping sensation that something was wrong. Something more than just my poor scores. Komi must have thought that too because she hesitated for an almost imperceptible fraction of a second. I wouldn't even have noticed if I hadn't been looking for it since the idea of being left alone was so suddenly more terrifying than even coming here in the first place. But then she was about-facing and marching away toward the lifts back down to our squad bay's deck. There was nothing else for her to do.{&1310}\par I felt whatever courage was left go with her and was suddenly vastly alone in this alien world on the officers' deck.{&1310}\par "Now, listen to me, Weir," Morisant started once my eyes had stopped trailing Komi out of the sides and were forlornly back on him. I kept it from my face, however, hiding behind my position at attention. "You will be as respectful with the Commander as you have been with me -- with any officer in uniform you might have seen about decks. You will not speak unless asked a question, and you will be clear and brief when you respond. Do you understand?"{&1310}\par "A-aye, sir."{&1310}\par "Do you understand me, Cadet?"{&1310}\par "Aye, sir," I repeated, forcing it out raggedly this time.{&1310}\par He studied me for a few more seconds. It was hard not to shake in my service boots under that heavy stare. I lost myself in wonder about what sort of abilities he might have had and been hiding from us this whole time, but my face was a wooden mask. I think he could see past it, but it was enough that I had learned how to wear it like plastic under pressure. It was enough, and it was all I had left.{&1310}\par "Stay behind and to my left as we enter," he told me, "and then stay put until you are dismissed. Understood, Cadet?"{&1310}\par "Aye, sir."{&1310}\par The lieutenant turned back toward the door he'd been standing in front of, flashed a hand to the panel beside it, and swept me inside as it opened. His step was crisp and brisk and military, and I suddenly felt so much more nervous stepping into the unknown that I was sure I would trip over myself as I plodded along dutifully after. I didn't, somehow. I even managed to stop behind him in time as he came to stand before a spartan-looking workstation with a man that couldn't have been much older than me sitting behind it with his thumb in his mouth and watching several viewscreens. He looked up at Morisant.{&1310}\par "Lieutenant," the other man acknowledged with a slow, unimpressed tone that held some underlying meaning in it that I couldn't follow in my currently piqued state. I did have enough awareness to recognize that the man was the same rank by the pips on his stiff collar. But somehow, Morisant just seemed so much older.{&1310}\par "Lieutenant," Morisant returned.{&1310}\par "She's waiting," the man told him with that same, pregnant tone. I realized he must have been an adjutant, and the way he said that made me suddenly worry about how \i long\i0  she'd been waiting. I'd only seen the commander once -- hard, cold, with lines on her face that she didn't get from age and haired pulled back so tight I was sure it should've split her head into a rictus grin. She never smiled that I'd seen, though. Not that that was unusual. But her eye was. She'd lost it at some point in her career and there was only a beady-red cybernetic in its place. She'd been short -- barely more than a meter-and-a-half tall -- shorter than me and most of everyone else around her. But that eye ... god, that creepy fucking eye. I swear a few times during her introductory address to us future cadets that it had moved without the other one -- the still flesh-and-blood one.{&1310}\par The adjutant had pressed a button somewhere because a door to our right slipped open of a sudden. At least, I think he pressed a button. This \i was\i0  the academy's command so he could have been a psycho too, and probably was. It was easy to forget that other officers used their talents for mundane tasks like that all the time when Morisant didn't. He used his hands. He \i always\i0  used his hands. I don't know why that sometimes unsettled me even more.{&1310}\par Morisant turned and marched in through that door. I kept close on his heels, remembering to stay just a little behind and to the left until he stopped again. This time, it was in front of a rather large desk with every cadet's nightmare sitting right behind it.{&1310}\par Commander Delacroix.{&1310}\par There had been a creeping terror building in me ever since Morisant had commed into our room back at the squad bay. It had followed us up through the decks and all the way to the lieutenant standing outside this office. I hadn't thought about it. I couldn't \i let\i0  myself think about it. Even now it was hard to come out from hiding and face this tiny woman with her piercing red robotic eye. It wasn't on me yet, though.{&1310}\par "This is not standard procedure," Morisant was saying. For the moment, the commander's attention was totally on him and I started desperately trying to get my head back together now that I was finally here. "I want that noted."{&1310}\par "It's noted.{&1310}\par "If you'll please. Lieutenant."{&1310}\par The commander showed him the way to stand aside with a hand that was gloved to the wrist in immaculate black. He did. Then the moment I'd been secretly dreading before I'd even become aware of it but somewhere only recognized deep down when Morisant first said her name over the comm -- came.{&1310}\par Commander Delacroix turned to me.{&1310}\par "Cadet -- Evelyn -- Weir."{&1310}\par She enunciated each word in careful, clipped tones. If I'd expected some sort of fanfare when she looked at me like the sudden realization of all my fears and doubts as a cadet pulverizing me to dust there in her office ... I was disappointed. Instead there was just this feeling like being a tiny insect that had been put under a scope for disection -- some unintelligible assurance in the back of my head that I'd just been judged and found grossly inadequate. That everything I was was small, weak, and utterly insignificant in the grand schemes of this woman sitting with her hands steepled in mock-thought with me in front of her.{&1310}\par And that creepy, \i fucking\i0  eye.{&1310}\par "Twenty-three years old. Port of origin: Riftwatch Station research center. Father: Doctor Nolan Weir, rear admiral, retired. Mother: Doctor Evelyn Weir, deceased."{&1310}\par She started itemizing me in smooth, soft tones that were almost disarming. Indifferently casual. But not if you looked in her eyes. --\i Eye\i0 . It was dead cold, mirroring the other, and I didn't want to look at it anymore. I just stared straight ahead, right over the top of her screwed-tight bun.{&1310}\par "For someone of your father's reputation" -- she grasped a datapad in her hand that must have had my record on it, but only spared it a flick of her living eye -- "I expected a much more impressive performance report." Her hand brushed the pad aside. I got the distinct impression that she already knew my entire story by heart for some reason. Why -- I had \i no\i0  idea.{&1310}\par "Is that why I'm here, ma'am?" I asked of a sudden. "Poor performance?" It was a miracle I didn't choke on my words but I still had to squeeze them out in a rush to avoid sounding terrified and hoarse. It was stupid and Morisant had warned me not to speak unless she asked me a question. But I had to know. There was no reason to call a shitty cadet into the commander's office like this and the why had eaten away at me the whole way as much as the fear. Stupid. I had to resist the urge not to swallow, my tongue was so thick in my throat.{&1310}\par The commander spared a brief glance for Morisant standing at parade rest to one side of her desk at a respectful distance. Or was it wary?{&1310}\par "You are here, cadet," she started slowly, "because of your poor performance, yes." And then she began to itemize me there, too. In alphabetical order.{&1310}\par "Applied Physics: eighty-five percent efficiency.{&1310}\par "Combat Theory: seventy-four percent efficiency.{&1310}\par "Hand-to-Hand Combat: ninety-two percent efficiency.{&1310}\par "Historical Events: eighty-two percent efficiency.{&1310}\par "Leadership: sixty-two percent efficiency.{&1310}\par "System Politics: seventy-seven percent efficiency."{&1310}\par And, finally, she came to the last and most important one of all.{&1310}\par "Psychokinetic Aptitude ... {&1310}\par "Zero percent."{&1310}\par She paused again, letting that sink into me as I stood there staring off at nothing and just listening. I could feel her cybernetic eye with its bloody red light glaring at me as if the heat would start burning into my skin at any minute. I didn't look at her.{&1310}\par "You realize this is a failing performance, cadet."{&1310}\par It wasn't a question and I didn't bother answering. I just stood there, waiting for what would come next. No one in this room didn't already know all of this and what it meant. I still had no reason to be here.{&1310}\par She studied me for a moment before a small, tight-lipped not-quite-a-smile split her face like that bun had finally started tearing it in two. "You must be wondering why you're here." She leaned back a little and I felt her eyes wander a bit, sizing me up that much more. "We all know your poor performance is a problem -- a problem that is ultimately \i your\i0  responsibility to remediate. This is a proving ground, not strictly training, and the burden is on \i you\i0  to prove yourself to \i us\i0 . Now, there have been a number of cadets that have come back from pre-finals leave to demonstrate their first ever psychokinetic potential. I know that. Lieutenant Morisant knows that. Even \i you\i0  must know that from talking with your fellow cadets. It's part of the reason why we bother having them at all right before your final tests. It's \i not\i0  why you're here in my office.{&1310}\par "Lieutenant," she abruptly called on the man beside her desk who had been completely and dutifully silent this whole time while she was speaking.{&1310}\par "Ma'am." He popped back to life like he'd been turned to stone.{&1310}\par "Wait for your cadet outside, please."{&1310}\par "Ma'am?"{&1310}\par "You heard me," she repeated while she kept her eye locked on me. I could still feel it.{&1310}\par "Ma'am, this is not--"{&1310}\par "Lieutenant." She cut him off just as abruptly as she'd brought him back into the conversation. If I'd had more presence of mind I might have realized he was about to object to what was undoubtedly going to be a private discussion with me, a lowly cadet, and that it was probably against most protocols considering her rank. Or maybe not. A minute or so later I would remember his tone being rather protective, though, as far as Morisant went. Not intrusive. And that should have scared me a hell of a lot more.{&1310}\par As it was, I just waited anxiously there while the lieutenant marched out of her office and the doors slipped silently shut behind him. My body was frozen in place but my mind followed him out like he was my last lifeline back to what had always seemed a hostile and unknown environment but now, ironically, seemed so much more comfortable than this one. And that Lieutenant Morisant would seem like a friendly alternative was only due to how intimidating this tiny little career officer was with her mechanical eye pinning me down for study in front of her. If I'd been smarter, I might have wondered why she could make me so scared and asked what could she possibly do to hurt me other than send me home? Firing squad? Space me for improper ettiquette? No, that wouldn't look good for recruitment. Or maybe they could just make me disappear. Who would ever know? A few lies and I was gone forever. Maybe. Or maybe I was just afraid to get sent back home.{&1310}\par "Do you know how many soldiers I've lost under my command, cadet?"{&1310}\par I came back to awareness of the commander to realize that she was standing right in front of me, looking up at me because she was shorter and somehow making \i me\i0  feel like the small one. Her fine chin was jutting toward my throat like she meant to gouge me with it and that robot eye was glaring at me while the other one scanned my face.{&1310}\par "N-no, ma'am," I somehow managed to say.{&1310}\par "A hundred and forty-six. Do you know how many I regret?"{&1310}\par I shook my head, only realizing too late that that was \i not\i0  how you answered a superior officer. Especially as a cadet. But she seemed not to notice.{&1310}\par "Two. Why?" she asked herself rhetorically. "A rather big and grotesquely-modified mutie from Tau. They like to unleash the freaks on small squads sometimes to see how fast they break, did you know that? Tear through combat armor down to the bone and crack your spin" --she snapped her fingers loudly to one side of my head, making me wince-- "just like that. Luckily for me, this was only one of the intelligent ones I had to deal with. Just four arms filled with firebolts and happy to melt a few faces off my squad before retreating into the vents to take another shot at us later. I hesitated. I was young, didn't know what I was doing, and I hesitated. And two people died because I did.{&1310}\par "I lost my eye to that freak," she said, holding up a gloved hand, "and most of the fingers on this hand. I could have had the eye replaced with a cloned one, and why not?" She pointed at the cybernetic orb in her right socket. "This one's ugly, limited, and often times will hurt where you can't get at it, cadet. But it reminds me of what happens when you're stupid and you make decisions without thinking. Or don't make them at all."{&1310}\par She backed up a step and walked back to her desk.{&1310}\par "It also scares the living shit out of most recruits."{&1310}\par Somehow, I didn't think that was meant to be a joke.{&1310}\par "Project Arclight."{&1310}\par She'd had her back to me for a second. Just a second, and I felt some kind of relief from that onslaught. I almost slumped where I stood it was so exhausting to be so out-of-sorts and completely confused as to what the hell I was even here for and might happen next. Then she was on me again, twisting her head back around.{&1310}\par "Project Arclight, cadet," she repeated, giving me a strange, scrutinizing look. "Tell me what it is."{&1310}\par "What?"{&1310}\par The word came stumbling out of my mouth, stupified.{&1310}\par "Someone is making damn sure you stay in this program no matter what. I'd guess that they'd pull just the right strings to get you to graduate even if you never show a flicker of psychokinetic ability by finals, as impossible as that might be. Not really that unusual considering how many noteworthy candidates we get from influential military and civilian leaders. But this is different. This is borderline obssessive."{&1310}\par She turned fully back around and stared me down again. This time her face was not so much like a cat baiting a puny, ineffectual mouse, but a wolf or a lion or some other big planetary predator with lots of teeth going for the face and throat. \i My\i0  face and throat. It fixed me so hard I was sure she could draw blood with a look.{&1310}\par That mechanical eye twirled around a full three hundred and sixty degrees in its socket like it suddenly had a mind of its own.{&1310}\par "I usually check up on these things because I like to know who's trying to pull my strings. I won't send men and women to their deaths for no reason, cadet, and every cadet I let graduate is \i going\i0  to send people to their deaths. Maybe even cause them, like I did. Usually it's a father, mother, an uncle, grandfather -- something familial. Not in your case, Weir. I dug as deep as I could and my clearance apparently wasn't enough. All I could get on you past Riftwatch was Project Arclight. Now tell me," she ordered. "What is it."{&1310}\par "I don't ..."{&1310}\par I shook my head, and I kept shaking my head at her. On top of everything else, this was suddenly just \i too\i0  much information to process. Project Arclight? What the fuck was that even supposed to \i mean\i0  to me?{&1310}\par "I can't read you, Weir." She was suddenly in my face again and bearing down. Or up. Whatever. It sure felt like down. "I'm strong enough to get stray thoughts and most emotions off of people, but I can't get a single thing off you. I haven't had to use physical tells this much in years. Something's off about you. You're either lying or ignorant and both are deadly. Now tell me or I won't only make sure you don't graduate, but I will personally take you apart piece by bloody piece until I know for sure that you aren't a threat to anyone in Dreggoran space or beyond. If you're part of some fucked up genetic experiment, I better fucking know about it. Do I make myself clear?"{&1310}\par If she was expecting an affirmative or even a nod, all she got was a horrified expression of abject confusion. And maybe that was enough. Her whole posture made me expect some sudden incoming blow -- probably unseen. The material on my uniform had rippled from some invisible hand as she laid into me with that intense look in her eye of animal cunning and merciless cruelty. She looked at me like an enemy. An enemy she didn't understand yet, but she meant to. But she released me so abruptly from her crushing jaws that I nearly fell over flat on my face.{&1310}\par "You think about it, cadet. When you're back home. You think about it. If you come back, I'll expect an answer. If you don't come back ... well. I might just come looking for it myself, eventually.{&1310}\par "Dismissed."\cf2\f1 {&1310}\par }{&1310}

I hadn't been up here since in-processing, filtering in with all the other raw recruits brave, reckless, or stupid enough to sign their life away to the Grand Admirals and the Dreggoran Navy.

I asked of a sudden. "Poor performance?" It was a miracle I didn't choke on my words but I still had to squeeze them out in a rush to avoid sounding terrified and hoarse. It was stupid and Morisant had warned me not to speak unless she asked me a question. But I had to know. There was no reason to call a shitty cadet into the commander's office like this and the why had eaten away at me the whole way as much as the fear. Stupid. I had to resist the urge not to swallow, my tongue was so thick in my throat.{&1310}\par The commander spared a brief glance for Morisant standing at parade rest to one side of her desk at a respectful distance. Or was it wary?{&1310}\par "You are here, cadet," she started slowly, "because of your poor performance, yes." And then she began to itemize me there, too. In alphabetical order.{&1310}\par "Applied Physics: eighty-five percent efficiency.{&1310}\par "Combat Theory: seventy-four percent efficiency.{&1310}\par "Hand-to-Hand Combat: ninety-two percent efficiency.{&1310}\par "Historical Events: eighty-two percent efficiency.{&1310}\par "Leadership: sixty-two percent efficiency.{&1310}\par "System Politics: seventy-seven percent efficiency."{&1310}\par And, finally, she came to the last and most important one of all.{&1310}\par "Psychokinetic Aptitude ... {&1310}\par "Zero percent."{&1310}\par She paused again, letting that sink into me as I stood there staring off at nothing and just listening. I could feel her cybernetic eye with its bloody red light glaring at me as if the heat would start burning into my skin at any minute. I didn't look at her.{&1310}\par "You realize this is a failing performance, cadet."{&1310}\par It wasn't a question and I didn't bother answering. I just stood there, waiting for what would come next. No one in this room didn't already know all of this and what it meant. I still had no reason to be here.{&1310}\par She studied me for a moment before a small, tight-lipped not-quite-a-smile split her face like that bun had finally started tearing it in two. "You must be wondering why you're here." She leaned back a little and I felt her eyes wander a bit, sizing me up that much more. "We all know your poor performance is a problem -- a problem that is ultimately \i your\i0  responsibility to remediate. This is a proving ground, not strictly training, and the burden is on \i you\i0  to prove yourself to \i us\i0 . Now, there have been a number of cadets that have come back from pre-finals leave to demonstrate their first ever psychokinetic potential. I know that. Lieutenant Morisant knows that. Even \i you\i0  must know that from talking with your fellow cadets. It's part of the reason why we bother having them at all right before your final tests. It's \i not\i0  why you're here in my office.{&1310}\par "Lieutenant," she abruptly called on the man beside her desk who had been completely and dutifully silent this whole time while she was speaking.{&1310}\par "Ma'am." He popped back to life like he'd been turned to stone.{&1310}\par "Wait for your cadet outside, please."{&1310}\par "Ma'am?"{&1310}\par "You heard me," she repeated while she kept her eye locked on me. I could still feel it.{&1310}\par "Ma'am, this is not--"{&1310}\par "Lieutenant." She cut him off just as abruptly as she'd brought him back into the conversation. If I'd had more presence of mind I might have realized he was about to object to what was undoubtedly going to be a private discussion with me, a lowly cadet, and that it was probably against most protocols considering her rank. Or maybe not. A minute or so later I would remember his tone being rather protective, though, as far as Morisant went. Not intrusive. And that should have scared me a hell of a lot more.{&1310}\par As it was, I just waited anxiously there while the lieutenant marched out of her office and the doors slipped silently shut behind him. My body was frozen in place but my mind followed him out like he was my last lifeline back to what had always seemed a hostile and unknown environment but now, ironically, seemed so much more comfortable than this one. And that Lieutenant Morisant would seem like a friendly alternative was only due to how intimidating this tiny little career officer was with her mechanical eye pinning me down for study in front of her. If I'd been smarter, I might have wondered why she could make me so scared and asked what could she possibly do to hurt me other than send me home? Firing squad? Space me for improper ettiquette? No, that wouldn't look good for recruitment. Or maybe they could just make me disappear. Who would ever know? A few lies and I was gone forever. Maybe. Or maybe I was just afraid to get sent back home.{&1310}\par "Do you know how many soldiers I've lost under my command, cadet?"{&1310}\par I came back to awareness of the commander to realize that she was standing right in front of me, looking up at me because she was shorter and somehow making \i me\i0  feel like the small one. Her fine chin was jutting toward my throat like she meant to gouge me with it and that robot eye was glaring at me while the other one scanned my face.{&1310}\par "N-no, ma'am," I somehow managed to say.{&1310}\par "A hundred and forty-six. Do you know how many I regret?"{&1310}\par I shook my head, only realizing too late that that was \i not\i0  how you answered a superior officer. Especially as a cadet. But she seemed not to notice.{&1310}\par "Two. Why?" she asked herself rhetorically. "A rather big and grotesquely-modified mutie from Tau. They like to unleash the freaks on small squads sometimes to see how fast they break, did you know that? Tear through combat armor down to the bone and crack your spin" --she snapped her fingers loudly to one side of my head, making me wince-- "just like that. Luckily for me, this was only one of the intelligent ones I had to deal with. Just four arms filled with firebolts and happy to melt a few faces off my squad before retreating into the vents to take another shot at us later. I hesitated. I was young, didn't know what I was doing, and I hesitated. And two people died because I did.{&1310}\par "I lost my eye to that freak," she said, holding up a gloved hand, "and most of the fingers on this hand. I could have had the eye replaced with a cloned one, and why not?" She pointed at the cybernetic orb in her right socket. "This one's ugly, limited, and often times will hurt where you can't get at it, cadet. But it reminds me of what happens when you're stupid and you make decisions without thinking. Or don't make them at all."{&1310}\par She backed up a step and walked back to her desk.{&1310}\par "It also scares the living shit out of most recruits."{&1310}\par Somehow, I didn't think that was meant to be a joke.{&1310}\par "Project Arclight."{&1310}\par She'd had her back to me for a second. Just a second, and I felt some kind of relief from that onslaught. I almost slumped where I stood it was so exhausting to be so out-of-sorts and completely confused as to what the hell I was even here for and might happen next. Then she was on me again, twisting her head back around.{&1310}\par "Project Arclight, cadet," she repeated, giving me a strange, scrutinizing look. "Tell me what it is."{&1310}\par "What?"{&1310}\par The word came stumbling out of my mouth, stupified.{&1310}\par "Someone is making damn sure you stay in this program no matter what. I'd guess that they'd pull just the right strings to get you to graduate even if you never show a flicker of psychokinetic ability by finals, as impossible as that might be. Not really that unusual considering how many noteworthy candidates we get from influential military and civilian leaders. But this is different. This is borderline obssessive."{&1310}\par She turned fully back around and stared me down again. This time her face was not so much like a cat baiting a puny, ineffectual mouse, but a wolf or a lion or some other big planetary predator with lots of teeth going for the face and throat. \i My\i0  face and throat. It fixed me so hard I was sure she could draw blood with a look.{&1310}\par That mechanical eye twirled around a full three hundred and sixty degrees in its socket like it suddenly had a mind of its own.{&1310}\par "I usually check up on these things because I like to know who's trying to pull my strings. I won't send men and women to their deaths for no reason, cadet, and every cadet I let graduate is \i going\i0  to send people to their deaths. Maybe even cause them, like I did. Usually it's a father, mother, an uncle, grandfather -- something familial. Not in your case, Weir. I dug as deep as I could and my clearance apparently wasn't enough. All I could get on you past Riftwatch was Project Arclight. Now tell me," she ordered. "What is it."{&1310}\par "I don't ..."{&1310}\par I shook my head, and I kept shaking my head at her. On top of everything else, this was suddenly just \i too\i0  much information to process. Project Arclight? What the fuck was that even supposed to \i mean\i0  to me?{&1310}\par "I can't read you, Weir." She was suddenly in my face again and bearing down. Or up. Whatever. It sure felt like down. "I'm strong enough to get stray thoughts and most emotions off of people, but I can't get a single thing off you. I haven't had to use physical tells this much in years. Something's off about you. You're either lying or ignorant and both are deadly. Now tell me or I won't only make sure you don't graduate, but I will personally take you apart piece by bloody piece until I know for sure that you aren't a threat to anyone in Dreggoran space or beyond. If you're part of some fucked up genetic experiment, I better fucking know about it. Do I make myself clear?"{&1310}\par If she was expecting an affirmative or even a nod, all she got was a horrified expression of abject confusion. And maybe that was enough. Her whole posture made me expect some sudden incoming blow -- probably unseen. The material on my uniform had rippled from some invisible hand as she laid into me with that intense look in her eye of animal cunning and merciless cruelty. She looked at me like an enemy. An enemy she didn't understand yet, but she meant to. But she released me so abruptly from her crushing jaws that I nearly fell over flat on my face.{&1310}\par "You think about it, cadet. When you're back home. You think about it. If you come back, I'll expect an answer. If you don't come back ... well. I might just come looking for it myself, eventually.{&1310}\par "Dismissed."\cf2\f1 {&1310}\par }{&1310}

I hadn't been up here since in-processing, filtering in with all the other raw recruits brave, reckless, or stupid enough to sign their life away to the Grand Admirals and the Dreggoran Navy. There was a moment then when the knowing of had finally caught up with me. Up until that point, it had felt like a dream -- a distant possibility that couldn't really change things so much but would just \i happen\i0  eventually. Fear had settled over me like a cold blanket being drawn up by unseen hands and I'd looked around at everyone else, noticing that same dawning realization mirrored back on their faces. {&1310}\par What the hell was I thinking? What have I gotten myself into?{&1310}\par I'd been just a civilian back then. Frightened. Alone. Vulnerable. We all had been. Now we were trainees and cadets, and it seemed like a lifetime ago. Like it had been someone else who had done it. Not me.{&1310}\par I remembered Komi from back then. Aloof, but not like I had been with so many civilians I hadn't grown up around suddenly jostling around me. Recruitment campaigns were effective, and everyone hated what the pirates were doing. Komi had joined because she wanted to do something about it. She had been sure of herself even back then, though it was a quieter and less vetted confidence in herself. I'd barely paid her any mind until we were suddenly rackmates. I had joined because of dad.{&1310}\par They'd called Komi up here a few times -- for good reasons -- so she mostly knew the way. Escorting me wasn't quite the right way to think about it since we weren't supposed to go anywhere without at least one other person and certainly not to the officers' decks. We got stopped almost every five steps, offering a perfunctory salute to some crewman or naval officer wanting to know what we were even doing there. Cadets were usually escorted by their training officer. Morisant didn't meet us until we were right outside the commander's office.{&1310}\par "Cadets Kominshk and Weir, reporting as ordered, sir," Komi stated formally for the both of us. Only one of us had to.{&1310}\par "Cadets," he acknowledged us crisply, but didn't return our respectful salute. Active service members didn't have to do that onboard a ship. We did. {&1310}\par Conditioning.{&1310}\par "Kominshk."{&1310}\par "Aye, sir?"{&1310}\par "You're dismissed, cadet. Head back to the squad bay."{&1310}\par Komi glanced at me out of the corner of her eye, but she didn't object about being sent back alone instead of being told to wait. Not to an officer. Not to Morisant. It was strange, and a whole bunch of worries started crowding back in my head along with that creeping sensation that something was wrong. Something more than just my poor scores. Komi must have thought that too because she hesitated for an almost imperceptible fraction of a second. I wouldn't even have noticed if I hadn't been looking for it since the idea of being left alone was so suddenly more terrifying than even coming here in the first place. But then she was about-facing and marching away toward the lifts back down to our squad bay's deck. There was nothing else for her to do.{&1310}\par I felt whatever courage was left go with her and was suddenly vastly alone in this alien world on the officers' deck.{&1310}\par "Now, listen to me, Weir," Morisant started once my eyes had stopped trailing Komi out of the sides and were forlornly back on him. I kept it from my face, however, hiding behind my position at attention. "You will be as respectful with the Commander as you have been with me -- with any officer in uniform you might have seen about decks. You will not speak unless asked a question, and you will be clear and brief when you respond. Do you understand?"{&1310}\par "A-aye, sir."{&1310}\par "Do you understand me, Cadet?"{&1310}\par "Aye, sir," I repeated, forcing it out raggedly this time.{&1310}\par He studied me for a few more seconds. It was hard not to shake in my service boots under that heavy stare. I lost myself in wonder about what sort of abilities he might have had and been hiding from us this whole time, but my face was a wooden mask. I think he could see past it, but it was enough that I had learned how to wear it like plastic under pressure. It was enough, and it was all I had left.{&1310}\par "Stay behind and to my left as we enter," he told me, "and then stay put until you are dismissed. Understood, Cadet?"{&1310}\par "Aye, sir."{&1310}\par The lieutenant turned back toward the door he'd been standing in front of, flashed a hand to the panel beside it, and swept me inside as it opened. His step was crisp and brisk and military, and I suddenly felt so much more nervous stepping into the unknown that I was sure I would trip over myself as I plodded along dutifully after. I didn't, somehow. I even managed to stop behind him in time as he came to stand before a spartan-looking workstation with a man that couldn't have been much older than me sitting behind it with his thumb in his mouth and watching several viewscreens. He looked up at Morisant.{&1310}\par "Lieutenant," the other man acknowledged with a slow, unimpressed tone that held some underlying meaning in it that I couldn't follow in my currently piqued state. I did have enough awareness to recognize that the man was the same rank by the pips on his stiff collar. But somehow, Morisant just seemed so much older.{&1310}\par "Lieutenant," Morisant returned.{&1310}\par "She's waiting," the man told him with that same, pregnant tone. I realized he must have been an adjutant, and the way he said that made me suddenly worry about how \i long\i0  she'd been waiting. I'd only seen the commander once -- hard, cold, with lines on her face that she didn't get from age and haired pulled back so tight I was sure it should've split her head into a rictus grin. She never smiled that I'd seen, though. Not that that was unusual. But her eye was. She'd lost it at some point in her career and there was only a beady-red cybernetic in its place. She'd been short -- barely more than a meter-and-a-half tall -- shorter than me and most of everyone else around her. But that eye ... god, that creepy fucking eye. I swear a few times during her introductory address to us future cadets that it had moved without the other one -- the still flesh-and-blood one.{&1310}\par The adjutant had pressed a button somewhere because a door to our right slipped open of a sudden. At least, I think he pressed a button. This \i was\i0  the academy's command so he could have been a psycho too, and probably was. It was easy to forget that other officers used their talents for mundane tasks like that all the time when Morisant didn't. He used his hands. He \i always\i0  used his hands. I don't know why that sometimes unsettled me even more.{&1310}\par Morisant turned and marched in through that door. I kept close on his heels, remembering to stay just a little behind and to the left until he stopped again. This time, it was in front of a rather large desk with every cadet's nightmare sitting right behind it.{&1310}\par Commander Delacroix.{&1310}\par There had been a creeping terror building in me ever since Morisant had commed into our room back at the squad bay. It had followed us up through the decks and all the way to the lieutenant standing outside this office. I hadn't thought about it. I couldn't \i let\i0  myself think about it. Even now it was hard to come out from hiding and face this tiny woman with her piercing red robotic eye. It wasn't on me yet, though.{&1310}\par "This is not standard procedure," Morisant was saying. For the moment, the commander's attention was totally on him and I started desperately trying to get my head back together now that I was finally here. "I want that noted."{&1310}\par "It's noted.{&1310}\par "If you'll please. Lieutenant."{&1310}\par The commander showed him the way to stand aside with a hand that was gloved to the wrist in immaculate black. He did. Then the moment I'd been secretly dreading before I'd even become aware of it but somewhere only recognized deep down when Morisant first said her name over the comm -- came.{&1310}\par Commander Delacroix turned to me.{&1310}\par "Cadet -- Evelyn -- Weir."{&1310}\par She enunciated each word in careful, clipped tones. If I'd expected some sort of fanfare when she looked at me like the sudden realization of all my fears and doubts as a cadet pulverizing me to dust there in her office ... I was disappointed. Instead there was just this feeling like being a tiny insect that had been put under a scope for disection -- some unintelligible assurance in the back of my head that I'd just been judged and found grossly inadequate. That everything I was was small, weak, and utterly insignificant in the grand schemes of this woman sitting with her hands steepled in mock-thought with me in front of her.{&1310}\par And that creepy, \i fucking\i0  eye.{&1310}\par "Twenty-three years old. Port of origin: Riftwatch Station research center. Father: Doctor Nolan Weir, rear admiral, retired. Mother: Doctor Evelyn Weir, deceased."{&1310}\par She started itemizing me in smooth, soft tones that were almost disarming. Indifferently casual. But not if you looked in her eyes. --\i Eye\i0 . It was dead cold, mirroring the other, and I didn't want to look at it anymore. I just stared straight ahead, right over the top of her screwed-tight bun.{&1310}\par "For someone of your father's reputation" -- she grasped a datapad in her hand that must have had my record on it, but only spared it a flick of her living eye -- "I expected a much more impressive performance report." Her hand brushed the pad aside. I got the distinct impression that she already knew my entire story by heart for some reason. Why -- I had \i no\i0  idea.{&1310}\par "Is that why I'm here, ma'am?"

What the fuck was that even supposed to \i mean\i0  to me?{&1310}\par "I can't read you, Weir." She was suddenly in my face again and bearing down. Or up. Whatever. It sure felt like down. "I'm strong enough to get stray thoughts and most emotions off of people, but I can't get a single thing off you. I haven't had to use physical tells this much in years. Something's off about you. You're either lying or ignorant and both are deadly. Now tell me or I won't only make sure you don't graduate, but I will personally take you apart piece by bloody piece until I know for sure that you aren't a threat to anyone in Dreggoran space or beyond.

Her whole posture made me expect some sudden incoming blow -- probably unseen. The material on my uniform had rippled from some invisible hand as she laid into me with that intense look in her eye of animal cunning and merciless cruelty. She looked at me like an enemy. An enemy she didn't understand yet, but she meant to. But she released me so abruptly from her crushing jaws that I nearly fell over flat on my face.{&1310}\par "You think about it, cadet.

I hadn't been up here since in-processing, filtering in with all the other raw recruits brave, reckless, or stupid enough to sign their life away to the Grand Admirals and the Dreggoran Navy. There was a moment then when the knowing of had finally caught up with me. Up until that point, it had felt like a dream -- a distant possibility that couldn't really change things so much but would just \i happen\i0  eventually. Fear had settled over me like a cold blanket being drawn up by unseen hands and I'd looked around at everyone else, noticing that same dawning realization mirrored back on their faces. {&1310}\par What the hell was I thinking? What have I gotten myself into?{&1310}\par I'd been just a civilian back then. Frightened. Alone. Vulnerable. We all had been. Now we were trainees and cadets, and it seemed like a lifetime ago. Like it had been someone else who had done it. Not me.{&1310}\par I remembered Komi from back then. Aloof, but not like I had been with so many civilians I hadn't grown up around suddenly jostling around me. Recruitment campaigns were effective, and everyone hated what the pirates were doing. Komi had joined because she wanted to do something about it. She had been sure of herself even back then, though it was a quieter and less vetted confidence in herself. I'd barely paid her any mind until we were suddenly rackmates. I had joined because of dad.{&1310}\par They'd called Komi up here a few times -- for good reasons -- so she mostly knew the way. Escorting me wasn't quite the right way to think about it since we weren't supposed to go anywhere without at least one other person and certainly not to the officers' decks. We got stopped almost every five steps, offering a perfunctory salute to some crewman or naval officer wanting to know what we were even doing there. Cadets were usually escorted by their training officer. Morisant didn't meet us until we were right outside the commander's office.{&1310}\par "Cadets Kominshk and Weir, reporting as ordered, sir," Komi stated formally for the both of us. Only one of us had to.{&1310}\par "Cadets," he acknowledged us crisply, but didn't return our respectful salute. Active service members didn't have to do that onboard a ship. We did. {&1310}\par Conditioning.{&1310}\par "Kominshk."{&1310}\par "Aye, sir?"{&1310}\par "You're dismissed, cadet. Head back to the squad bay."{&1310}\par Komi glanced at me out of the corner of her eye, but she didn't object about being sent back alone instead of being told to wait. Not to an officer. Not to Morisant. It was strange, and a whole bunch of worries started crowding back in my head along with that creeping sensation that something was wrong. Something more than just my poor scores. Komi must have thought that too because she hesitated for an almost imperceptible fraction of a second. I wouldn't even have noticed if I hadn't been looking for it since the idea of being left alone was so suddenly more terrifying than even coming here in the first place. But then she was about-facing and marching away toward the lifts back down to our squad bay's deck. There was nothing else for her to do.{&1310}\par I felt whatever courage was left go with her and was suddenly vastly alone in this alien world on the officers' deck.{&1310}\par "Now, listen to me, Weir," Morisant started once my eyes had stopped trailing Komi out of the sides and were forlornly back on him. I kept it from my face, however, hiding behind my position at attention. "You will be as respectful with the Commander as you have been with me -- with any officer in uniform you might have seen about decks. You will not speak unless asked a question, and you will be clear and brief when you respond. Do you understand?"{&1310}\par "A-aye, sir."{&1310}\par "Do you understand me, Cadet?"{&1310}\par "Aye, sir," I repeated, forcing it out raggedly this time.{&1310}\par He studied me for a few more seconds. It was hard not to shake in my service boots under that heavy stare. I lost myself in wonder about what sort of abilities he might have had and been hiding from us this whole time, but my face was a wooden mask. I think he could see past it, but it was enough that I had learned how to wear it like plastic under pressure. It was enough, and it was all I had left.{&1310}\par "Stay behind and to my left as we enter," he told me, "and then stay put until you are dismissed. Understood, Cadet?"{&1310}\par "Aye, sir."{&1310}\par The lieutenant turned back toward the door he'd been standing in front of, flashed a hand to the panel beside it, and swept me inside as it opened. His step was crisp and brisk and military, and I suddenly felt so much more nervous stepping into the unknown that I was sure I would trip over myself as I plodded along dutifully after. I didn't, somehow. I even managed to stop behind him in time as he came to stand before a spartan-looking workstation with a man that couldn't have been much older than me sitting behind it with his thumb in his mouth and watching several viewscreens. He looked up at Morisant.{&1310}\par "Lieutenant," the other man acknowledged with a slow, unimpressed tone that held some underlying meaning in it that I couldn't follow in my currently piqued state. I did have enough awareness to recognize that the man was the same rank by the pips on his stiff collar. But somehow, Morisant just seemed so much older.{&1310}\par "Lieutenant," Morisant returned.{&1310}\par "She's waiting," the man told him with that same, pregnant tone. I realized he must have been an adjutant, and the way he said that made me suddenly worry about how \i long\i0  she'd been waiting. I'd only seen the commander once -- hard, cold, with lines on her face that she didn't get from age and haired pulled back so tight I was sure it should've split her head into a rictus grin. She never smiled that I'd seen, though. Not that that was unusual. But her eye was. She'd lost it at some point in her career and there was only a beady-red cybernetic in its place. She'd been short -- barely more than a meter-and-a-half tall -- shorter than me and most of everyone else around her. But that eye ... god, that creepy fucking eye. I swear a few times during her introductory address to us future cadets that it had moved without the other one -- the still flesh-and-blood one.{&1310}\par The adjutant had pressed a button somewhere because a door to our right slipped open of a sudden. At least, I think he pressed a button. This \i was\i0  the academy's command so he could have been a psycho too, and probably was. It was easy to forget that other officers used their talents for mundane tasks like that all the time when Morisant didn't. He used his hands. He \i always\i0  used his hands. I don't know why that sometimes unsettled me even more.{&1310}\par Morisant turned and marched in through that door. I kept close on his heels, remembering to stay just a little behind and to the left until he stopped again. This time, it was in front of a rather large desk with every cadet's nightmare sitting right behind it.{&1310}\par Commander Delacroix.{&1310}\par There had been a creeping terror building in me ever since Morisant had commed into our room back at the squad bay. It had followed us up through the decks and all the way to the lieutenant standing outside this office. I hadn't thought about it. I couldn't \i let\i0  myself think about it. Even now it was hard to come out from hiding and face this tiny woman with her piercing red robotic eye. It wasn't on me yet, though.{&1310}\par "This is not standard procedure," Morisant was saying. For the moment, the commander's attention was totally on him and I started desperately trying to get my head back together now that I was finally here. "I want that noted."{&1310}\par "It's noted.{&1310}\par "If you'll please. Lieutenant."{&1310}\par The commander showed him the way to stand aside with a hand that was gloved to the wrist in immaculate black. He did. Then the moment I'd been secretly dreading before I'd even become aware of it but somewhere only recognized deep down when Morisant first said her name over the comm -- came.{&1310}\par Commander Delacroix turned to me.{&1310}\par "Cadet -- Evelyn -- Weir."{&1310}\par She enunciated each word in careful, clipped tones. If I'd expected some sort of fanfare when she looked at me like the sudden realization of all my fears and doubts as a cadet pulverizing me to dust there in her office ... I was disappointed. Instead there was just this feeling like being a tiny insect that had been put under a scope for disection -- some unintelligible assurance in the back of my head that I'd just been judged and found grossly inadequate. That everything I was was small, weak, and utterly insignificant in the grand schemes of this woman sitting with her hands steepled in mock-thought with me in front of her.{&1310}\par And that creepy, \i fucking\i0  eye.{&1310}\par "Twenty-three years old. Port of origin: Riftwatch Station research center. Father: Doctor Nolan Weir, rear admiral, retired. Mother: Doctor Evelyn Weir, deceased."{&1310}\par She started itemizing me in smooth, soft tones that were almost disarming. Indifferently casual. But not if you looked in her eyes. --\i Eye\i0 . It was dead cold, mirroring the other, and I didn't want to look at it anymore. I just stared straight ahead, right over the top of her screwed-tight bun.{&1310}\par "For someone of your father's reputation" -- she grasped a datapad in her hand that must have had my record on it, but only spared it a flick of her living eye -- "I expected a much more impressive performance report." Her hand brushed the pad aside. I got the distinct impression that she already knew my entire story by heart for some reason. Why -- I had \i no\i0  idea.{&1310}\par "Is that why I'm here, ma'am?" I asked of a sudden. "Poor performance?" It was a miracle I didn't choke on my words but I still had to squeeze them out in a rush to avoid sounding terrified and hoarse. It was stupid and Morisant had warned me not to speak unless she asked me a question. But I had to know. There was no reason to call a shitty cadet into the commander's office like this and the why had eaten away at me the whole way as much as the fear. Stupid. I had to resist the urge not to swallow, my tongue was so thick in my throat.{&1310}\par The commander spared a brief glance for Morisant standing at parade rest to one side of her desk at a respectful distance. Or was it wary?{&1310}\par "You are here, cadet," she started slowly, "because of your poor performance, yes." And then she began to itemize me there, too. In alphabetical order.{&1310}\par "Applied Physics: eighty-five percent efficiency.{&1310}\par "Combat Theory: seventy-four percent efficiency.{&1310}\par "Hand-to-Hand Combat: ninety-two percent efficiency.{&1310}\par "Historical Events: eighty-two percent efficiency.{&1310}\par "Leadership: sixty-two percent efficiency.{&1310}\par "System Politics: seventy-seven percent efficiency."{&1310}\par And, finally, she came to the last and most important one of all.{&1310}\par "Psychokinetic Aptitude ... {&1310}\par "Zero percent."{&1310}\par She paused again, letting that sink into me as I stood there staring off at nothing and just listening. I could feel her cybernetic eye with its bloody red light glaring at me as if the heat would start burning into my skin at any minute. I didn't look at her.{&1310}\par "You realize this is a failing performance, cadet."{&1310}\par It wasn't a question and I didn't bother answering. I just stood there, waiting for what would come next. No one in this room didn't already know all of this and what it meant. I still had no reason to be here.{&1310}\par She studied me for a moment before a small, tight-lipped not-quite-a-smile split her face like that bun had finally started tearing it in two. "You must be wondering why you're here." She leaned back a little and I felt her eyes wander a bit, sizing me up that much more. "We all know your poor performance is a problem -- a problem that is ultimately \i your\i0  responsibility to remediate. This is a proving ground, not strictly training, and the burden is on \i you\i0  to prove yourself to \i us\i0 . Now, there have been a number of cadets that have come back from pre-finals leave to demonstrate their first ever psychokinetic potential. I know that. Lieutenant Morisant knows that. Even \i you\i0  must know that from talking with your fellow cadets. It's part of the reason why we bother having them at all right before your final tests. It's \i not\i0  why you're here in my office.{&1310}\par "Lieutenant," she abruptly called on the man beside her desk who had been completely and dutifully silent this whole time while she was speaking.{&1310}\par "Ma'am." He popped back to life like he'd been turned to stone.{&1310}\par "Wait for your cadet outside, please."{&1310}\par "Ma'am?"{&1310}\par "You heard me," she repeated while she kept her eye locked on me. I could still feel it.{&1310}\par "Ma'am, this is not--"{&1310}\par "Lieutenant." She cut him off just as abruptly as she'd brought him back into the conversation. If I'd had more presence of mind I might have realized he was about to object to what was undoubtedly going to be a private discussion with me, a lowly cadet, and that it was probably against most protocols considering her rank. Or maybe not. A minute or so later I would remember his tone being rather protective, though, as far as Morisant went. Not intrusive. And that should have scared me a hell of a lot more.{&1310}\par As it was, I just waited anxiously there while the lieutenant marched out of her office and the doors slipped silently shut behind him. My body was frozen in place but my mind followed him out like he was my last lifeline back to what had always seemed a hostile and unknown environment but now, ironically, seemed so much more comfortable than this one. And that Lieutenant Morisant would seem like a friendly alternative was only due to how intimidating this tiny little career officer was with her mechanical eye pinning me down for study in front of her. If I'd been smarter, I might have wondered why she could make me so scared and asked what could she possibly do to hurt me other than send me home? Firing squad? Space me for improper ettiquette? No, that wouldn't look good for recruitment. Or maybe they could just make me disappear. Who would ever know? A few lies and I was gone forever. Maybe. Or maybe I was just afraid to get sent back home.{&1310}\par "Do you know how many soldiers I've lost under my command, cadet?"{&1310}\par I came back to awareness of the commander to realize that she was standing right in front of me, looking up at me because she was shorter and somehow making \i me\i0  feel like the small one. Her fine chin was jutting toward my throat like she meant to gouge me with it and that robot eye was glaring at me while the other one scanned my face.{&1310}\par "N-no, ma'am," I somehow managed to say.{&1310}\par "A hundred and forty-six. Do you know how many I regret?"{&1310}\par I shook my head, only realizing too late that that was \i not\i0  how you answered a superior officer. Especially as a cadet. But she seemed not to notice.{&1310}\par "Two. Why?" she asked herself rhetorically. "A rather big and grotesquely-modified mutie from Tau. They like to unleash the freaks on small squads sometimes to see how fast they break, did you know that? Tear through combat armor down to the bone and crack your spin" --she snapped her fingers loudly to one side of my head, making me wince-- "just like that. Luckily for me, this was only one of the intelligent ones I had to deal with. Just four arms filled with firebolts and happy to melt a few faces off my squad before retreating into the vents to take another shot at us later. I hesitated. I was young, didn't know what I was doing, and I hesitated. And two people died because I did.{&1310}\par "I lost my eye to that freak," she said, holding up a gloved hand, "and most of the fingers on this hand. I could have had the eye replaced with a cloned one, and why not?" She pointed at the cybernetic orb in her right socket. "This one's ugly, limited, and often times will hurt where you can't get at it, cadet. But it reminds me of what happens when you're stupid and you make decisions without thinking. Or don't make them at all."{&1310}\par She backed up a step and walked back to her desk.{&1310}\par "It also scares the living shit out of most recruits."{&1310}\par Somehow, I didn't think that was meant to be a joke.{&1310}\par "Project Arclight."{&1310}\par She'd had her back to me for a second. Just a second, and I felt some kind of relief from that onslaught. I almost slumped where I stood it was so exhausting to be so out-of-sorts and completely confused as to what the hell I was even here for and might happen next. Then she was on me again, twisting her head back around.{&1310}\par "Project Arclight, cadet," she repeated, giving me a strange, scrutinizing look. "Tell me what it is."{&1310}\par "What?"{&1310}\par The word came stumbling out of my mouth, stupified.{&1310}\par "Someone is making damn sure you stay in this program no matter what. I'd guess that they'd pull just the right strings to get you to graduate even if you never show a flicker of psychokinetic ability by finals, as impossible as that might be. Not really that unusual considering how many noteworthy candidates we get from influential military and civilian leaders. But this is different. This is borderline obssessive."{&1310}\par She turned fully back around and stared me down again. This time her face was not so much like a cat baiting a puny, ineffectual mouse, but a wolf or a lion or some other big planetary predator with lots of teeth going for the face and throat. \i My\i0  face and throat. It fixed me so hard I was sure she could draw blood with a look.{&1310}\par That mechanical eye twirled around a full three hundred and sixty degrees in its socket like it suddenly had a mind of its own.{&1310}\par "I usually check up on these things because I like to know who's trying to pull my strings. I won't send men and women to their deaths for no reason, cadet, and every cadet I let graduate is \i going\i0  to send people to their deaths. Maybe even cause them, like I did. Usually it's a father, mother, an uncle, grandfather -- something familial. Not in your case, Weir. I dug as deep as I could and my clearance apparently wasn't enough. All I could get on you past Riftwatch was Project Arclight. Now tell me," she ordered. "What is it."{&1310}\par "I don't ..."{&1310}\par I shook my head, and I kept shaking my head at her. On top of everything else, this was suddenly just \i too\i0  much information to process. Project Arclight? What the fuck was that even supposed to \i mean\i0  to me?{&1310}\par "I can't read you, Weir." She was suddenly in my face again and bearing down. Or up. Whatever. It sure felt like down. "I'm strong enough to get stray thoughts and most emotions off of people, but I can't get a single thing off you. I haven't had to use physical tells this much in years. Something's off about you. You're either lying or ignorant and both are deadly. Now tell me or I won't only make sure you don't graduate, but I will personally take you apart piece by bloody piece until I know for sure that you aren't a threat to anyone in Dreggoran space or beyond. If you're part of some fucked up genetic experiment, I better fucking know about it. Do I make myself clear?"{&1310}\par If she was expecting an affirmative or even a nod, all she got was a horrified expression of abject confusion. And maybe that was enough. Her whole posture made me expect some sudden incoming blow -- probably unseen. The material on my uniform had rippled from some invisible hand as she laid into me with that intense look in her eye of animal cunning and merciless cruelty. She looked at me like an enemy. An enemy she didn't understand yet, but she meant to. But she released me so abruptly from her crushing jaws that I nearly fell over flat on my face.{&1310}\par "You think about it, cadet.

This time, it was in front of a rather large desk with every cadet's nightmare sitting right behind it.{&1310}\par Commander Delacroix.{&1310}\par There had been a creeping terror building in me ever since Morisant had commed into our room back at the squad bay. It had followed us up through the decks and all the way to the lieutenant standing outside this office. I hadn't thought about it. I couldn't \i let\i0  myself think about it. Even now it was hard to come out from hiding and face this tiny woman with her piercing red robotic eye. It wasn't on me yet, though.{&1310}\par "This is not standard procedure," Morisant was saying. For the moment, the commander's attention was totally on him and I started desperately trying to get my head back together now that I was finally here. "I want that noted."{&1310}\par "It's noted.{&1310}\par "If you'll please. Lieutenant."{&1310}\par The commander showed him the way to stand aside with a hand that was gloved to the wrist in immaculate black. He did. Then the moment I'd been secretly dreading before I'd even become aware of it but somewhere only recognized deep down when Morisant first said her name over the comm -- came.{&1310}\par Commander Delacroix turned to me.{&1310}\par "Cadet -- Evelyn -- Weir."{&1310}\par She enunciated each word in careful, clipped tones. If I'd expected some sort of fanfare when she looked at me like the sudden realization of all my fears and doubts as a cadet pulverizing me to dust there in her office ... I was disappointed. Instead there was just this feeling like being a tiny insect that had been put under a scope for disection -- some unintelligible assurance in the back of my head that I'd just been judged and found grossly inadequate. That everything I was was small, weak, and utterly insignificant in the grand schemes of this woman sitting with her hands steepled in mock-thought with me in front of her.{&1310}\par And that creepy, \i fucking\i0  eye.{&1310}\par "Twenty-three years old. Port of origin: Riftwatch Station research center. Father: Doctor Nolan Weir, rear admiral, retired. Mother: Doctor Evelyn Weir, deceased."{&1310}\par She started itemizing me in smooth, soft tones that were almost disarming. Indifferently casual. But not if you looked in her eyes. --\i Eye\i0 . It was dead cold, mirroring the other, and I didn't want to look at it anymore. I just stared straight ahead, right over the top of her screwed-tight bun.{&1310}\par "For someone of your father's reputation" -- she grasped a datapad in her hand that must have had my record on it, but only spared it a flick of her living eye -- "I expected a much more impressive performance report." Her hand brushed the pad aside. I got the distinct impression that she already knew my entire story by heart for some reason. Why -- I had \i no\i0  idea.{&1310}\par "Is that why I'm here, ma'am?" I asked of a sudden. "Poor performance?" It was a miracle I didn't choke on my words but I still had to squeeze them out in a rush to avoid sounding terrified and hoarse. It was stupid and Morisant had warned me not to speak unless she asked me a question. But I had to know. There was no reason to call a shitty cadet into the commander's office like this and the why had eaten away at me the whole way as much as the fear. Stupid. I had to resist the urge not to swallow, my tongue was so thick in my throat.{&1310}\par The commander spared a brief glance for Morisant standing at parade rest to one side of her desk at a respectful distance. Or was it wary?{&1310}\par "You are here, cadet," she started slowly, "because of your poor performance, yes." And then she began to itemize me there, too. In alphabetical order.{&1310}\par "Applied Physics: eighty-five percent efficiency.{&1310}\par "Combat Theory: seventy-four percent efficiency.{&1310}\par "Hand-to-Hand Combat: ninety-two percent efficiency.{&1310}\par "Historical Events: eighty-two percent efficiency.{&1310}\par "Leadership: sixty-two percent efficiency.{&1310}\par "System Politics: seventy-seven percent efficiency."{&1310}\par And, finally, she came to the last and most important one of all.{&1310}\par "Psychokinetic Aptitude ... {&1310}\par "Zero percent."{&1310}\par She paused again, letting that sink into me as I stood there staring off at nothing and just listening. I could feel her cybernetic eye with its bloody red light glaring at me as if the heat would start burning into my skin at any minute. I didn't look at her.{&1310}\par "You realize this is a failing performance, cadet."{&1310}\par It wasn't a question and I didn't bother answering. I just stood there, waiting for what would come next. No one in this room didn't already know all of this and what it meant. I still had no reason to be here.{&1310}\par She studied me for a moment before a small, tight-lipped not-quite-a-smile split her face like that bun had finally started tearing it in two. "You must be wondering why you're here." She leaned back a little and I felt her eyes wander a bit, sizing me up that much more. "We all know your poor performance is a problem -- a problem that is ultimately \i your\i0  responsibility to remediate. This is a proving ground, not strictly training, and the burden is on \i you\i0  to prove yourself to \i us\i0 . Now, there have been a number of cadets that have come back from pre-finals leave to demonstrate their first ever psychokinetic potential. I know that. Lieutenant Morisant knows that. Even \i you\i0  must know that from talking with your fellow cadets. It's part of the reason why we bother having them at all right before your final tests. It's \i not\i0  why you're here in my office.{&1310}\par "Lieutenant," she abruptly called on the man beside her desk who had been completely and dutifully silent this whole time while she was speaking.{&1310}\par "Ma'am." He popped back to life like he'd been turned to stone.{&1310}\par "Wait for your cadet outside, please."{&1310}\par "Ma'am?"{&1310}\par "You heard me," she repeated while she kept her eye locked on me. I could still feel it.{&1310}\par "Ma'am, this is not--"{&1310}\par "Lieutenant." She cut him off just as abruptly as she'd brought him back into the conversation. If I'd had more presence of mind I might have realized he was about to object to what was undoubtedly going to be a private discussion with me, a lowly cadet, and that it was probably against most protocols considering her rank. Or maybe not. A minute or so later I would remember his tone being rather protective, though, as far as Morisant went. Not intrusive. And that should have scared me a hell of a lot more.{&1310}\par As it was, I just waited anxiously there while the lieutenant marched out of her office and the doors slipped silently shut behind him. My body was frozen in place but my mind followed him out like he was my last lifeline back to what had always seemed a hostile and unknown environment but now, ironically, seemed so much more comfortable than this one. And that Lieutenant Morisant would seem like a friendly alternative was only due to how intimidating this tiny little career officer was with her mechanical eye pinning me down for study in front of her. If I'd been smarter, I might have wondered why she could make me so scared and asked what could she possibly do to hurt me other than send me home? Firing squad? Space me for improper ettiquette? No, that wouldn't look good for recruitment. Or maybe they could just make me disappear. Who would ever know? A few lies and I was gone forever. Maybe. Or maybe I was just afraid to get sent back home.{&1310}\par "Do you know how many soldiers I've lost under my command, cadet?"{&1310}\par I came back to awareness of the commander to realize that she was standing right in front of me, looking up at me because she was shorter and somehow making \i me\i0  feel like the small one. Her fine chin was jutting toward my throat like she meant to gouge me with it and that robot eye was glaring at me while the other one scanned my face.{&1310}\par "N-no, ma'am," I somehow managed to say.{&1310}\par "A hundred and forty-six. Do you know how many I regret?"{&1310}\par I shook my head, only realizing too late that that was \i not\i0  how you answered a superior officer. Especially as a cadet. But she seemed not to notice.{&1310}\par "Two. Why?" she asked herself rhetorically. "A rather big and grotesquely-modified mutie from Tau. They like to unleash the freaks on small squads sometimes to see how fast they break, did you know that? Tear through combat armor down to the bone and crack your spin" --she snapped her fingers loudly to one side of my head, making me wince-- "just like that. Luckily for me, this was only one of the intelligent ones I had to deal with. Just four arms filled with firebolts and happy to melt a few faces off my squad before retreating into the vents to take another shot at us later. I hesitated. I was young, didn't know what I was doing, and I hesitated. And two people died because I did.{&1310}\par "I lost my eye to that freak," she said, holding up a gloved hand, "and most of the fingers on this hand. I could have had the eye replaced with a cloned one, and why not?" She pointed at the cybernetic orb in her right socket. "This one's ugly, limited, and often times will hurt where you can't get at it, cadet. But it reminds me of what happens when you're stupid and you make decisions without thinking. Or don't make them at all."{&1310}\par She backed up a step and walked back to her desk.{&1310}\par "It also scares the living shit out of most recruits."{&1310}\par Somehow, I didn't think that was meant to be a joke.{&1310}\par "Project Arclight."{&1310}\par She'd had her back to me for a second. Just a second, and I felt some kind of relief from that onslaught. I almost slumped where I stood it was so exhausting to be so out-of-sorts and completely confused as to what the hell I was even here for and might happen next. Then she was on me again, twisting her head back around.{&1310}\par "Project Arclight, cadet," she repeated, giving me a strange, scrutinizing look. "Tell me what it is."{&1310}\par "What?"{&1310}\par The word came stumbling out of my mouth, stupified.{&1310}\par "Someone is making damn sure you stay in this program no matter what. I'd guess that they'd pull just the right strings to get you to graduate even if you never show a flicker of psychokinetic ability by finals, as impossible as that might be. Not really that unusual considering how many noteworthy candidates we get from influential military and civilian leaders. But this is different. This is borderline obssessive."{&1310}\par She turned fully back around and stared me down again. This time her face was not so much like a cat baiting a puny, ineffectual mouse, but a wolf or a lion or some other big planetary predator with lots of teeth going for the face and throat. \i My\i0  face and throat. It fixed me so hard I was sure she could draw blood with a look.{&1310}\par That mechanical eye twirled around a full three hundred and sixty degrees in its socket like it suddenly had a mind of its own.{&1310}\par "I usually check up on these things because I like to know who's trying to pull my strings. I won't send men and women to their deaths for no reason, cadet, and every cadet I let graduate is \i going\i0  to send people to their deaths. Maybe even cause them, like I did. Usually it's a father, mother, an uncle, grandfather -- something familial. Not in your case, Weir. I dug as deep as I could and my clearance apparently wasn't enough. All I could get on you past Riftwatch was Project Arclight. Now tell me," she ordered. "What is it."{&1310}\par "I don't ..."{&1310}\par I shook my head, and I kept shaking my head at her. On top of everything else, this was suddenly just \i too\i0  much information to process. Project Arclight? What the fuck was that even supposed to \i mean\i0  to me?{&1310}\par "I can't read you, Weir." She was suddenly in my face again and bearing down. Or up. Whatever. It sure felt like down. "I'm strong enough to get stray thoughts and most emotions off of people, but I can't get a single thing off you. I haven't had to use physical tells this much in years. Something's off about you. You're either lying or ignorant and both are deadly. Now tell me or I won't only make sure you don't graduate, but I will personally take you apart piece by bloody piece until I know for sure that you aren't a threat to anyone in Dreggoran space or beyond. If you're part of some fucked up genetic experiment, I better fucking know about it. Do I make myself clear?"{&1310}\par If she was expecting an affirmative or even a nod, all she got was a horrified expression of abject confusion. And maybe that was enough. Her whole posture made me expect some sudden incoming blow -- probably unseen. The material on my uniform had rippled from some invisible hand as she laid into me with that intense look in her eye of animal cunning and merciless cruelty. She looked at me like an enemy. An enemy she didn't understand yet, but she meant to. But she released me so abruptly from her crushing jaws that I nearly fell over flat on my face.{&1310}\par "You think about it, cadet. When you're back home. You think about it. If you come back, I'll expect an answer. If you don't come back ... well. I might just come looking for it myself, eventually.{&1310}\par "Dismissed."\cf2\f1 {&1310}\par }{&1310}

I hadn't been up here since in-processing, filtering in with all the other raw recruits brave, reckless, or stupid enough to sign their life away to the Grand Admirals and the Dreggoran Navy. There was a moment then when the knowing of had finally caught up with me. Up until that point, it had felt like a dream -- a distant possibility that couldn't really change things so much but would just \i happen\i0  eventually. Fear had settled over me like a cold blanket being drawn up by unseen hands and I'd looked around at everyone else, noticing that same dawning realization mirrored back on their faces. {&1310}\par What the hell was I thinking? What have I gotten myself into?{&1310}\par I'd been just a civilian back then. Frightened. Alone. Vulnerable. We all had been. Now we were trainees and cadets, and it seemed like a lifetime ago. Like it had been someone else who had done it. Not me.{&1310}\par I remembered Komi from back then. Aloof, but not like I had been with so many civilians I hadn't grown up around suddenly jostling around me. Recruitment campaigns were effective, and everyone hated what the pirates were doing. Komi had joined because she wanted to do something about it. She had been sure of herself even back then, though it was a quieter and less vetted confidence in herself. I'd barely paid her any mind until we were suddenly rackmates. I had joined because of dad.{&1310}\par They'd called Komi up here a few times -- for good reasons -- so she mostly knew the way. Escorting me wasn't quite the right way to think about it since we weren't supposed to go anywhere without at least one other person and certainly not to the officers' decks. We got stopped almost every five steps, offering a perfunctory salute to some crewman or naval officer wanting to know what we were even doing there. Cadets were usually escorted by their training officer. Morisant didn't meet us until we were right outside the commander's office.{&1310}\par "Cadets Kominshk and Weir, reporting as ordered, sir," Komi stated formally for the both of us. Only one of us had to.{&1310}\par "Cadets," he acknowledged us crisply, but didn't return our respectful salute. Active service members didn't have to do that onboard a ship. We did. {&1310}\par Conditioning.{&1310}\par "Kominshk."{&1310}\par "Aye, sir?"{&1310}\par "You're dismissed, cadet. Head back to the squad bay."{&1310}\par Komi glanced at me out of the corner of her eye, but she didn't object about being sent back alone instead of being told to wait. Not to an officer. Not to Morisant. It was strange, and a whole bunch of worries started crowding back in my head along with that creeping sensation that something was wrong. Something more than just my poor scores. Komi must have thought that too because she hesitated for an almost imperceptible fraction of a second. I wouldn't even have noticed if I hadn't been looking for it since the idea of being left alone was so suddenly more terrifying than even coming here in the first place. But then she was about-facing and marching away toward the lifts back down to our squad bay's deck. There was nothing else for her to do.{&1310}\par I felt whatever courage was left go with her and was suddenly vastly alone in this alien world on the officers' deck.{&1310}\par "Now, listen to me, Weir," Morisant started once my eyes had stopped trailing Komi out of the sides and were forlornly back on him. I kept it from my face, however, hiding behind my position at attention. "You will be as respectful with the Commander as you have been with me -- with any officer in uniform you might have seen about decks. You will not speak unless asked a question, and you will be clear and brief when you respond. Do you understand?"{&1310}\par "A-aye, sir."{&1310}\par "Do you understand me, Cadet?"{&1310}\par "Aye, sir," I repeated, forcing it out raggedly this time.{&1310}\par He studied me for a few more seconds. It was hard not to shake in my service boots under that heavy stare. I lost myself in wonder about what sort of abilities he might have had and been hiding from us this whole time, but my face was a wooden mask. I think he could see past it, but it was enough that I had learned how to wear it like plastic under pressure. It was enough, and it was all I had left.{&1310}\par "Stay behind and to my left as we enter," he told me, "and then stay put until you are dismissed. Understood, Cadet?"{&1310}\par "Aye, sir."{&1310}\par The lieutenant turned back toward the door he'd been standing in front of, flashed a hand to the panel beside it, and swept me inside as it opened. His step was crisp and brisk and military, and I suddenly felt so much more nervous stepping into the unknown that I was sure I would trip over myself as I plodded along dutifully after. I didn't, somehow. I even managed to stop behind him in time as he came to stand before a spartan-looking workstation with a man that couldn't have been much older than me sitting behind it with his thumb in his mouth and watching several viewscreens. He looked up at Morisant.{&1310}\par "Lieutenant," the other man acknowledged with a slow, unimpressed tone that held some underlying meaning in it that I couldn't follow in my currently piqued state. I did have enough awareness to recognize that the man was the same rank by the pips on his stiff collar. But somehow, Morisant just seemed so much older.{&1310}\par "Lieutenant," Morisant returned.{&1310}\par "She's waiting," the man told him with that same, pregnant tone. I realized he must have been an adjutant, and the way he said that made me suddenly worry about how \i long\i0  she'd been waiting. I'd only seen the commander once -- hard, cold, with lines on her face that she didn't get from age and haired pulled back so tight I was sure it should've split her head into a rictus grin. She never smiled that I'd seen, though. Not that that was unusual. But her eye was. She'd lost it at some point in her career and there was only a beady-red cybernetic in its place. She'd been short -- barely more than a meter-and-a-half tall -- shorter than me and most of everyone else around her. But that eye ... god, that creepy fucking eye. I swear a few times during her introductory address to us future cadets that it had moved without the other one -- the still flesh-and-blood one.{&1310}\par The adjutant had pressed a button somewhere because a door to our right slipped open of a sudden. At least, I think he pressed a button. This \i was\i0  the academy's command so he could have been a psycho too, and probably was. It was easy to forget that other officers used their talents for mundane tasks like that all the time when Morisant didn't. He used his hands. He \i always\i0  used his hands. I don't know why that sometimes unsettled me even more.{&1310}\par Morisant turned and marched in through that door. I kept close on his heels, remembering to stay just a little behind and to the left until he stopped again. This time, it was in front of a rather large desk with every cadet's nightmare sitting right behind it.{&1310}\par Commander Delacroix.{&1310}\par There had been a creeping terror building in me ever since Morisant had commed into our room back at the squad bay.

Or don't make them at all."{&1310}\par She backed up a step and walked back to her desk.{&1310}\par "It also scares the living shit out of most recruits."{&1310}\par Somehow, I didn't think that was meant to be a joke.{&1310}\par "Project Arclight."{&1310}\par She'd had her back to me for a second. Just a second, and I felt some kind of relief from that onslaught. I almost slumped where I stood it was so exhausting to be so out-of-sorts and completely confused as to what the hell I was even here for and might happen next. Then she was on me again, twisting her head back around.{&1310}\par "Project Arclight, cadet," she repeated, giving me a strange, scrutinizing look. "Tell me what it is."{&1310}\par "What?"{&1310}\par The word came stumbling out of my mouth, stupified.{&1310}\par "Someone is making damn sure you stay in this program no matter what. I'd guess that they'd pull just the right strings to get you to graduate even if you never show a flicker of psychokinetic ability by finals, as impossible as that might be. Not really that unusual considering how many noteworthy candidates we get from influential military and civilian leaders. But this is different. This is borderline obssessive."{&1310}\par She turned fully back around and stared me down again. This time her face was not so much like a cat baiting a puny, ineffectual mouse, but a wolf or a lion or some other big planetary predator with lots of teeth going for the face and throat. \i My\i0  face and throat. It fixed me so hard I was sure she could draw blood with a look.{&1310}\par That mechanical eye twirled around a full three hundred and sixty degrees in its socket like it suddenly had a mind of its own.{&1310}\par "I usually check up on these things because I like to know who's trying to pull my strings. I won't send men and women to their deaths for no reason, cadet, and every cadet I let graduate is \i going\i0  to send people to their deaths. Maybe even cause them, like I did. Usually it's a father, mother, an uncle, grandfather -- something familial. Not in your case, Weir. I dug as deep as I could and my clearance apparently wasn't enough. All I could get on you past Riftwatch was Project Arclight. Now tell me," she ordered. "What is it."{&1310}\par "I don't ..."{&1310}\par I shook my head, and I kept shaking my head at her. On top of everything else, this was suddenly just \i too\i0  much information to process. Project Arclight? What the fuck was that even supposed to \i mean\i0  to me?{&1310}\par "I can't read you, Weir." She was suddenly in my face again and bearing down. Or up. Whatever. It sure felt like down. "I'm strong enough to get stray thoughts and most emotions off of people, but I can't get a single thing off you. I haven't had to use physical tells this much in years. Something's off about you. You're either lying or ignorant and both are deadly. Now tell me or I won't only make sure you don't graduate, but I will personally take you apart piece by bloody piece until I know for sure that you aren't a threat to anyone in Dreggoran space or beyond. If you're part of some fucked up genetic experiment, I better fucking know about it. Do I make myself clear?"{&1310}\par If she was expecting an affirmative or even a nod, all she got was a horrified expression of abject confusion. And maybe that was enough. Her whole posture made me expect some sudden incoming blow -- probably unseen. The material on my uniform had rippled from some invisible hand as she laid into me with that intense look in her eye of animal cunning and merciless cruelty. She looked at me like an enemy. An enemy she didn't understand yet, but she meant to. But she released me so abruptly from her crushing jaws that I nearly fell over flat on my face.{&1310}\par "You think about it, cadet. When you're back home. You think about it. If you come back, I'll expect an answer. If you don't come back ... well. I might just come looking for it myself, eventually.{&1310}\par "Dismissed."\cf2\f1 {&1310}\par }{&1310}
