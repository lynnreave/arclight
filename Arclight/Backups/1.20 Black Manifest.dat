They were in a corridor then, leading back toward the deck ports where they had boarded - where there were ladder and stairwells to the upper decks. None of the poor running in the bowels of the ship were supposed to be allowed out, though, and a uniformed man came at them immediately with a heavy cudgel and an angry look.{&1310}\par "No one's allowed out of the aft lounge during transit," he started to say. Disinterested. Almost bored. He was used to dealing with the kinds of people stuffed together back in the hold behind.

It crackled with life, slowing everything around them down to a perceived crawl.

He had been very careful never to let her see him use any form of pyschokinesis on another human being before. It was a shock that could not be helped.{&1310}\par "Keep moving," was all Nolan said, not bothering to answer, or wait for her to pick up pace again.

A cold sweat sheathed his face, and he had to grit his teeth to make himself go on when they reached a stairwell. It ascended farther up than he needed it to, but he was having a hard time keeping his thinking straight. Not with that rending sound like the gnashing of teeth on space itself so deafening in his ears. A lesser man might have clawed them out.

Not that there was anything else he could do for her. He was scared himself, and with much more good reason to be. He knew everything that she did not, and there were a good many reasons to worry about whether or not they would even survive the next few minutes. That he had somehow been outmaneuvered was not lost on him in the slightest.{&1310}\par And that was why, in some ways, it was a godsend when they reached the next corridor and they were suddenly not alone anymore.

He knew everything that she did not, and there were a good many reasons to worry about whether or not they would even survive the next few minutes.

The girl's frown turned anxious and worried as he sat staring off into space and through her like she wasn't even there. His face went white, and he started to shake.{&1310}\par "Dad ...?"{&1310}\par When she reached to touch him, he gasped back to life so suddenly she jumped herself. It took him another moment to steady his trembling hands. But then he was digging them into her arm.{&1310}\par "We need to get out of here!" he hissed in her face.{&1310}\par She opened her mouth to say something, but he never gave her the chance. Bounding back up to his feet, he hauled her up bodily with him. She might have cried out in surprise at the suddenness of it, but it was the furthest thing from Nolan's mind just then. He could \i feel\i0  the universe coming apart around them. {&1310}\par Like he had only one time before in his entire life.{&1310}\par They had to climb over the destitute hordes to get to the other side of the cabin. Those ones barely seemed to notice. He didn't. A lot of coughing, low whispers, and a few children crying. He ignored it, pulling the girl along and stomping right through now as if it were nothing.{&1310}\par In a few minutes, they undoubtedly would be.{&1310}\par "Uh ..."{&1310}\par He hit the doors and yanked her through without another word. They were in a corridor then, leading back toward the deck ports where they had boarded - where there were ladder and stairwells to the upper decks. None of the poor running in the bowels of the ship were supposed to be allowed out, though, and a uniformed man came at them immediately with a heavy cudgel and an angry look.{&1310}\par "No one's allowed out of the aft lounge during transit," he started to say. Disinterested. Almost bored. He was used to dealing with the kinds of people stuffed together back in the hold behind. But Nolan didn't give him a chance to do much else.{&1310}\par The air was abruptly thick, thunderheads flashing across Weir's brow. It crackled with life, slowing everything around them down to a perceived crawl. Then the guard leapt up abruptly from the deck and threw himself over into the bulkhead, out cold in an instant without another sound. The man slumped down to the floor on his side.
