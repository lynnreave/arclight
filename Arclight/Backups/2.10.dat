He stared at me while the other one kept talking into his comm to someone else. It was the first time I'd actually gotten a good look at either of them, and that one who'd chased me down sure looked like he'd be into attacking people in their own quarters in the middle of the night. He had a roughly trimmed beard and head, except for a short mohawk spike of hair sticking up from the middle like a buzzsaw out of the top of his skull. Scars crisscrossed the stubble on either side of his scalp with one really big, \i ugly \i0 one cutting down over his left eyebrow. He had combat armor plating underneath a light, brown coat hanging down and not doing much to hide the fact that he was mostly corded muscle beneath that. While I stared back, he put his knife to the other side of his face and just kept staring at me with this dead-eyed, calculating look.{&1310}\par "What do you want?" I started to ask, my voice -- thankfully -- barely quavering. But he cut me off by bouncing his gun down and pointing it straight at my head. My eyes snapped shut and I threw my hands in front of my face, waiting for a blinding pain and flash of light, but ... nothing came. I tentatively opened them a couple seconds later and he was just sitting there pointing that pistol at me without saying a word. The other guy was still talking, low and agitated.{&1310}\par "That wasn't what we were told to do," he grunted into his comm. "I don't care if you-" whoever it was cut him off abruptly and he started pacing. I didn't take my eyes off the gun pointed at me but I could hear the other one's boots clomping back and forth as he paced. I could tell he was limping slightly.{&1310}\par "Let's get one thing straight, fuckhead -- I \i don't\i0  take orders from you. If you don't have a way out, then we'll just have to take our chances with the head instead of the whole body. He told me that was enough and a helluva lot better than nothing."{&1310}\par Head? \i What\i0 ?{&1310}\par I tried to make sense of that, but ... No. This whole thing didn't make sense, and I started to realize that as I finally got a chance to sit here and think about it. It just made a cold sort of desperation creep up inside me as I started to wonder if they were just going to kill me after all.{&1310}\par Head? My head? My \i head\i0  ...?{&1310}\par Who else could they mean?{&1310}\par No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. That couldn't be right.{&1310}\par "You just do your fucking job and let me do mine now that you've fucked it up," that other one was growling, still trying to keep his voice down but not doing a very good job of it. The thought dawned on me that these guys might not have been after me at all really, but Dad. It was the only thing that \i did\i0  make sense.{&1310}\par "Whatever." The call terminated. "Dumb prick." And that other one finally turned back to us.{&1310}\par "Well?" the knife guy finally asked, but his voice was flat. Dispassionate. He never took his eyes off me on the ground and I felt my skin crawl underneath it. The other one sighed.{&1310}\par "He's fucking useless. Couldn't get the clearance to clear a path."{&1310}\par "Then we can't take her with us," the creepy one said, and I felt a sudden surge of hope. Whatever the hell was going on here, they'd botched it somehow and couldn't get me out. The fact that they'd been going to kidnap me in the first place was only slightly more comforting than the original thought that they were just going to kill me. But then why hadn't he just shot me when I tried to run? Unless he couldn't. Even if he had meant to kill me, he hadn't bothered to shoot that poor drunk marine. Just bludgeon him to death.{&1310}\par "Don't you think I know that? He said he only needed the head."{&1310}\par "So?"{&1310}\par \i Uhhhh\i0  ...{&1310}\par "So why don't you get your hacksaw? Can you do that? \i Please\i0 ?" the one who'd tried to shoot me first asked with too much exasperated sarcasm. The creepy guy, in turn, just cocked his head to one side and got off the bed.{&1310}\par \i No nonononononono.\i0 {&1310}\par "Don't you fucking move, little girl."{&1310}\par The mouthy one had his gun trained on me now from behind. I noticed the other guy digging in a pack he had on the floor to one side. I didn't like what I was seeing come out.{&1310}\par Eyes wide, I flipped around toward the one behind me and shoved both my hands at him, pleading. "Please don't!"{&1310}\par "Shut up."{&1310}\par "Whatever you're going to do, please don't -- I can -- I know s ... I ..."{&1310}\par I struggled with something -- anything -- to give him, but I just sat there on my knees, stammering in a violent, desperate rush.{&1310}\par The guy with the gun on me -- he was taller than the other one, with long, rough and dull brown hair limping down past his jaw and his untrimmed, full-faced beard -- he just took a step forward and shoved a boot in my guts.{&1310}\par I was dimly aware of dry-heaving on the deck a little while later, my face almost kissing carpet. Saliva trailed down from my mouth and my insides felt like they were coming apart. Eventually, I couldn't hold myself upright any longer and I flopped down on my side, cradling those shards of glass inside my stomach.{&1310}\par "Hey."{&1310}\par A head swam above me.{&1310}\par "Heyheyhey."{&1310}\par Then a hand was buried in my hair. It started pulling and pain shot through my scalp like it would rip right off. I grabbed that hand with both of mine and it yanked me partially up off the floor.{&1310}\par I was looking into the bearded guy's face then, baring my teeth. I wish it was because I was filled with rage and death-defying defiance, ready to spinkick my way right through his guts. I thought about it.{&1310}\par But no. It just fucking hurt. \i Everything\i0  hurt. {&1310}\par He smiled at me.{&1310}\par "My friend's going to take just a little bit off the top here," he said, still with that lop-sided grin that said "cat playing with a mouse," and jabbed a finger into my neck. The gun replaced his finger a second later, and he snapped my head back so I was looking up at him.{&1310}\par My eyes drifted sideways toward that other one pulling out of a carrybag what looked like one of those hand-held, molecular-bladed bonesaws the medical officers kept in their emergency kits for field amputations. I felt sick in my throat, looking at it. The room felt surreal, spinning around me.{&1310}\par Where was Dad? I was going to die -- right \i here\i0  -- and he wouldn't even know until long after these two were gone. Why had I ever let him kick me back out in the first place? Why hadn't I gone to see Tess? Why had I run away from Mills?{&1310}\par A dozen things differently and I wouldn't be here right now. Somehow, that wasn't comforting. Because I was still -- \i right\i0  -- \i here\i0 .{&1310}\par "Hold her down," the knife guy said, and started moving back over toward us. And I threw a wild, desperate punch at the bearded guy's crotch.{&1310}\par My knuckles crunched against a protective cup and went numb for a split second before screaming out at me in pain. That hand let go of my hair, though, and I collapsed to the deck.{&1310}\par The bearded guy stumbled back a step, cupping himself and growling. It wasn't the reaction I was hoping for, though. Not the one I needed. And before I could even think to make another move on either of them, the other one swung a boot right up into my face.{&1310}\par My jaw clacked shut and the tip of my tongue burst into blood. My head snapped back and things went white.{&1310}\par I was on the deck in a daze when I came back to, the taste of blood in my mouth. My tongue hurt. I tried to look up and around, but someone had their hands on my back, pushing me down. I started to scream unintelligibly with my swollen tongue, kicking out with everything I still had.{&1310}\par "Cut her," one of them said. The other pushed a button and a shimmering blue blade came to life in the saw behind my head.{&1310}\par And so did the station alarms.{&1310}\par Everything stopped. Klaxons blared overhead, the lights dimmed too much, came back slightly, and flashed red. Those two guys both looked sharply up and around, shocked and pissed all at once. I froze, buzzing inside my head.{&1310}\par "Fuck!"{&1310}\par "... He didn't ..."{&1310}\par They got off me, but I barely felt it. White noise crept across my skull and everything washed over fuzzy. Something tugged at the back of my brain.{&1310}\par "Too early. He's too fucking early!"{&1310}\par "We need to move ..."{&1310}\par "Fuck! No. Grab her first!"{&1310}\par They came back to me. I didn't even notice. Something was wrong.{&1310}\par With me.{&1310}\par With everything.{&1310}\par I felt it all start coming apart.{&1310}\par That tugging at something inside my head got more insistent. I looked down, and I was on my hands and knees. The wire around my legs was loose and I kicked my way out of it without feeling. I still had to get out of there -- away. Those two were staring at me.{&1310}\par No. Something behind me.{&1310}\par They didn't forget me, though.{&1310}\par A gun flashed in front of my face. Mohawk guy. I watched him bare his teeth and waited for the end ... but he just kept on staring like he had been. There was a flicker of ... \i something \i0 ... in his cruel eyes. The other one was agape.{&1310}\par That tug was physical now too. I felt my clothes pulling me backwards toward nothing. My bed? I tried to look around, but everything felt heavy and slow -- like I was stuck trying to run inside a dream.{&1310}\par Then that something inside my head snapped, and everything folded in on itself until there was only black.{&1310}\par {&1310}\par {&1310}\par Red warning lights were blinking in my face.{&1310}\par I winced, and tried to open my eyes. Everything was black laced with bright red and, for a second, I had no idea where I was.{&1310}\par Then, I remembered.{&1310}\par I was floating. I had no idea how fast I was moving, but that blaring HUD screaming "NO TETHER DETECTED" at me told me all I ever needed to know.{&1310}\par ... To freak the fuck out.{&1310}\par I'd hit the emergency airlock release on my borrowed suit in a panic and been catapulted out into empty space. A whole new kind of panic gripped me now.{&1310}\par I flailed, and started to spin. Blood thundered in my ears. There was nothing but the sound of my suddenly desperate, ragged breathing in the silence of the suit. My faceplate was still splattered with black sludge from that melting corpse and all I could see was the outline of void whirling around me. I started to scream.{&1310}\par That didn't slow me down at all.{&1310}\par How long was I out?{&1310}\par How far had I \i gone\i0  ...?{&1310}\par I couldn't see the station. I couldn't see anything!{&1310}\par WARNING: RAPID OXYGEN DEPLETION{&1310}\par My HUD howled at me again, lighting up in bright, disturbingly visible letters. I was hyperventilating, alternating between sucking in all the air I could and shrieking at the top of my lungs at nothing. No one would hear me.{&1310}\par Where was Dad?{&1310}\par Where was that voice?{&1310}\par Where was \i anyone\i0  ...?{&1310}\par "HELP ME!" I screamed at all of them and tried to pound empty space with my fists. My rotation changed.{&1310}\par I fumbled at my wrist. I couldn't see anything past that slime and pawed furiously at my faceplate instead. It didn't budge.{&1310}\par I remembered the voice activation command for internal comms and screamed it unintelligibly twice before I got it to turn on.{&1310}\par "Somebody -- \i anybody\i0  -- I'moutsideandIcan'tseeanythingandIdon'tknowwhereIamplease-"{&1310}\par I word vomitted, sobbing into that open mic. My stomach felt sick and I thought I might throw up for the millionth time that day. How much could possibly be left? Who knew if I was even still in range of the station? Who knew if anyone was even still \i alive \i0 ...?{&1310}\par "Please ... I need help, I'm ..." I begged. To no one.{&1310}\par Something hit me.{&1310}\par My heart lurched, my whole body spinning around head-over-heels. Gray-almost-black flashed in solid angles at the edges of my faceplate -- just enough to tell me it was something apart from vacuum. {&1310}\par I cried out in surprise, flipping over. My arms flew out grasping. I caught something and held on as hard as I could. I had no idea how fast I'd been going, but I got a good idea with how violently I swung around and smashed chest-first into something solid. For a few seconds I couldn't breath. But I still hung on.{&1310}\par WARNING: RAPID OXYGEN DEPLETION went from red to yellow to white before I could breathe again, then spiked to yellow for about a minute while I wondered in a daze if my faceplate would crack open. My left hand was a vicious claw wrapped around metal scaffolding I couldn't see and dark metal plates winked at the edges of my faceplate around that black sludge. I just sort of hung there for a long while, tethered by one arm and floating, relief washing over my whole body like a warm blanket. And I tried to forget the frenzied thought of flying off into empty void until I asphyxiated. Alone. Forgotten.{&1310}\par Dad came back to mind.{&1310}\par I'd been going too fast and too long after careening out of that airlock. I don't think he'd meant for me to do that when he'd led me there -- \i if\i0  he'd led me there. Well ... I'd gotten out, hadn't I? But I shouldn't have hit the station. I should have been floating off forever into black.{&1310}\par So what had I hit then?{&1310}\par I brought my free hand around and tried to swipe at that slime on my faceplate again. It had frozen and I ended up clawing at ice. A few minutes of that and I was growling blindly at it, duraflex suit gloves completely fucking useless.{&1310}\par Wait.{&1310}\par I had an angry, desperate sort of idea that only came so close to bashing my own head against metal again. I yanked myself close to whatever that thing was I was holding onto and found the edge of the metal in my hand that had been trying to dig into my other glove the whole while. I lined up my faceplate against that with both hands now and start to scrape.{&1310}\par And it worked!{&1310}\par Sort of.{&1310}\par That stuff started to break off in chunks and squirm away. I laughed a shaky laugh into my faceplate, forgetting how disgusting all of that really was. I could see!{&1310}\par Just in time to notice the huge chunks of metal rocketing overhead.{&1310}\par My body lurched on reflex, breath half catching in my throat, half tearing out of it in a another strangled cry of surprise. That was the only sound I heard as huge things screamed overhead, venting thrust and atmosphere into space while I flopped around right beneath them. Thank god I didn't let go.{&1310}\par It stopped almost as abruptly as it had started. Those things shooting out overhead. And they \i were\i0  shooting. It took my too stressed, tired, and fear-soaked brain too long to realize where they were going. Or what they were. Or what was even happening.{&1310}\par Boarding pods.{&1310}\par The station.{&1310}\par Riftwatch was being attacked.{&1310}\par And somehow ... some ridiculously laughable way -- \i I\i0  must've been hanging onto an enemy ship.{&1310}\par My eyes fixed to the hull beneath me -- or beside me. I assumed I'd been hanging up and down, but now that I could see the station I realized I was really at a dizzyingly upturned angle. My stomach lurched into my throat before I could focus enough to stabilize my sense of direction.{&1310}\par Then my eyes inevitably slipped back toward the station. \i Home\i0 .{&1310}\par I was immediately reminded of coming in what must have been only yesterday morning, staring at that same sight from beside Miller. Except this time I was dangling from an enemy ship in space. Watching boarding pods crash into the station's hull.{&1310}\par What struck me first was how dim and spotty the lights looked. Like the power was failing in more places than just that research tower I'd been in. And, finally reminded again of that place I'd been so desperately ejected out of -- I found it, stabbing up out of the station's riftward side like a dead, metal finger.{&1310}\par "God ..."{&1310}\par "... hello?"{&1310}\par Static.{&1310}\par I blinked, so in shock to hear someone else's voice that I forgot my grip on the hull of that ship and started to drift away for a second.{&1310}\par "... Hello? Come in. Who's on this frequency?"{&1310}\par I scrambled to grab a hold of the hull again.{&1310}\par "H-hello!" I practically shouted into my comm. I'd forgotten all about it, and I'd been breathing, screaming, gasping, and grunting into open frequency for the past few minutes without caring. Who \i did \i0 care? Someone had heard me!{&1310}\par "Who is this? ID number \i now\i0  marine. You're supposed to be at dead comms."{&1310}\par "This is-is Evelyn Weir, I'm-" I started babbling fiercely at that voice on the other end. I didn't care who it was, as long as they could help me. "I don't have a formal ID number yet, I haven't been commissioned!" And I probably never would.{&1310}\par There was a long pause, and I got the impression that whoever it was might have been trying to look me up or otherwise figure out who the hell I was. If there was actual fighting on the station ... there was no telling \i what\i0  they might be thinking. {&1310}\par Either way, it was the first \i actual\i0  human being I'd heard the voice of in what felt like forever. No monsters. No corpses. And especially no corpses that were still trying to move around, claw you apart, and fall apart themselves all over the place.{&1310}\par No, I was getting rescued.{&1310}\par I was finally -- getting -- rescued.\cf2\f1 {&1310}\par }{&1310}

I couldn't see anything!{&1310}\par WARNING: RAPID OXYGEN DEPLETION{&1310}\par My HUD howled at me again, lighting up in bright, disturbingly visible letters. I was hyperventilating, alternating between sucking in all the air I could and shrieking at the top of my lungs at nothing. No one would hear me.{&1310}\par Where was Dad?{&1310}\par Where was that voice?{&1310}\par Where was \i anyone\i0  ...?{&1310}\par "HELP ME!" I screamed at all of them and tried to pound empty space with my fists. My rotation changed.{&1310}\par I fumbled at my wrist. I couldn't see anything past that slime and pawed furiously at my faceplate instead. It didn't budge.{&1310}\par I remembered the voice activation command for internal comms and screamed it unintelligibly twice before I got it to turn on.{&1310}\par "Somebody -- \i anybody\i0  -- I'moutsideandIcan'tseeanythingandIdon'tknowwhereIamplease-"{&1310}\par I word vomitted, sobbing into that open mic. My stomach felt sick and I thought I might throw up for the millionth time that day. How much could possibly be left? Who knew if I was even still in range of the station? Who knew if anyone was even still \i alive \i0 ...?{&1310}\par "Please ... I need help, I'm ..." I begged. To no one.{&1310}\par Something hit me.{&1310}\par My heart lurched, my whole body spinning around head-over-heels. Gray-almost-black flashed in solid angles at the edges of my faceplate -- just enough to tell me it was something apart from vacuum. {&1310}\par I cried out in surprise, flipping over. My arms flew out grasping. I caught something and held on as hard as I could. I had no idea how fast I'd been going, but I got a good idea with how violently I swung around and smashed chest-first into something solid. For a few seconds I couldn't breath. But I still hung on.{&1310}\par WARNING: RAPID OXYGEN DEPLETION went from red to yellow to white before I could breathe again, then spiked to yellow for about a minute while I wondered in a daze if my faceplate would crack open. My left hand was a vicious claw wrapped around metal scaffolding I couldn't see and dark metal plates winked at the edges of my faceplate around that black sludge. I just sort of hung there for a long while, tethered by one arm and floating, relief washing over my whole body like a warm blanket. And I tried to forget the frenzied thought of flying off into empty void until I asphyxiated. Alone. Forgotten.{&1310}\par Dad came back to mind.{&1310}\par I'd been going too fast and too long after careening out of that airlock. I don't think he'd meant for me to do that when he'd led me there -- \i if\i0  he'd led me there. Well ... I'd gotten out, hadn't I? But I shouldn't have hit the station. I should have been floating off forever into black.{&1310}\par So what had I hit then?{&1310}\par I brought my free hand around and tried to swipe at that slime on my faceplate again. It had frozen and I ended up clawing at ice. A few minutes of that and I was growling blindly at it, duraflex suit gloves completely fucking useless.{&1310}\par Wait.{&1310}\par I had an angry, desperate sort of idea that only came so close to bashing my own head against metal again. I yanked myself close to whatever that thing was I was holding onto and found the edge of the metal in my hand that had been trying to dig into my other glove the whole while. I lined up my faceplate against that with both hands now and start to scrape.{&1310}\par And it worked!{&1310}\par Sort of.{&1310}\par That stuff started to break off in chunks and squirm away. I laughed a shaky laugh into my faceplate, forgetting how disgusting all of that really was. I could see!{&1310}\par Just in time to notice the huge chunks of metal rocketing overhead.{&1310}\par My body lurched on reflex, breath half catching in my throat, half tearing out of it in a another strangled cry of surprise. That was the only sound I heard as huge things screamed overhead, venting thrust and atmosphere into space while I flopped around right beneath them. Thank god I didn't let go.{&1310}\par It stopped almost as abruptly as it had started. Those things shooting out overhead. And they \i were\i0  shooting. It took my too stressed, tired, and fear-soaked brain too long to realize where they were going. Or what they were. Or what was even happening.{&1310}\par Boarding pods.{&1310}\par The station.{&1310}\par Riftwatch was being attacked.{&1310}\par And somehow ... some ridiculously laughable way -- \i I\i0  must've been hanging onto an enemy ship.{&1310}\par My eyes fixed to the hull beneath me -- or beside me. I assumed I'd been hanging up and down, but now that I could see the station I realized I was really at a dizzyingly upturned angle. My stomach lurched into my throat before I could focus enough to stabilize my sense of direction.{&1310}\par Then my eyes inevitably slipped back toward the station. \i Home\i0 .{&1310}\par I was immediately reminded of coming in what must have been only yesterday morning, staring at that same sight from beside Miller. Except this time I was dangling from an enemy ship in space. Watching boarding pods crash into the station's hull.{&1310}\par What struck me first was how dim and spotty the lights looked. Like the power was failing in more places than just that research tower I'd been in. And, finally reminded again of that place I'd been so desperately ejected out of -- I found it, stabbing up out of the station's riftward side like a dead, metal finger.{&1310}\par "God ..."{&1310}\par "... hello?"{&1310}\par Static.{&1310}\par I blinked, so in shock to hear someone else's voice that I forgot my grip on the hull of that ship and started to drift away for a second.{&1310}\par "... Hello? Come in. Who's on this frequency?"{&1310}\par I scrambled to grab a hold of the hull again.{&1310}\par "H-hello!" I practically shouted into my comm. I'd forgotten all about it, and I'd been breathing, screaming, gasping, and grunting into open frequency for the past few minutes without caring. Who \i did \i0 care? Someone had heard me!{&1310}\par "Who is this? ID number \i now\i0  marine. You're supposed to be at dead comms."{&1310}\par "This is-is Evelyn Weir, I'm-" I started babbling fiercely at that voice on the other end. I didn't care who it was, as long as they could help me. "I don't have a formal ID number yet, I haven't been commissioned!" And I probably never would.{&1310}\par There was a long pause, and I got the impression that whoever it was might have been trying to look me up or otherwise figure out who the hell I was. If there was actual fighting on the station ... there was no telling \i what\i0  they might be thinking. {&1310}\par Either way, it was the first \i actual\i0  human being I'd heard the voice of in what felt like forever. No monsters. No corpses. And especially no corpses that were still trying to move around, claw you apart, and fall apart themselves all over the place.{&1310}\par No, I was getting rescued.{&1310}\par I was finally -- getting -- rescued.\cf2\f1 {&1310}\par }{&1310}

He had a roughly trimmed beard and head except for a short mohawk spike of hair sticking up the middle like a buzzsaw out of the top of his skull. Scars crisscrossed the stubble on either side of his scalp with one really big, ugly one cutting down over his left eyebrow. I think he was wearing combat armor plating underneath that heavy, brown coat hanging down and not doing much to hide the fact that he was mostly corded muscle beneath that.

I started to ask, my voice barely quavering. But he cut me off by bouncing his gun down and pointing it straight at my head. My eyes snapped shut and I threw my hands in front of my face, waiting for a blinding pain and flash of light, but ... nothing came.

My arms flew out grasping. I caught something and held on as hard as I could.

He stared at me while the other one kept talking into his comm to someone else. It was the first time I'd actually gotten a good look at either of them, and that one who'd chased me down sure looked like he'd be into attacking people in their own quarters in the middle of the night. He had a roughly trimmed beard and head except for a short mohawk spike of hair sticking up the middle like a buzzsaw out of the top of his skull. Scars crisscrossed the stubble on either side of his scalp with one really big, ugly one cutting down over his left eyebrow. I think he was wearing combat armor plating underneath that heavy, brown coat hanging down and not doing much to hide the fact that he was mostly corded muscle beneath that. While I stared back, he put his knife to the other side of his face and just kept staring at me with this dead-eyed, calculating look.{&1310}\par "What do you want?" I started to ask, my voice barely quavering. But he cut me off by bouncing his gun down and pointing it straight at my head. My eyes snapped shut and I threw my hands in front of my face, waiting for a blinding pain and flash of light, but ... nothing came. I tentatively opened my eyes a couple seconds later and he was just sitting there pointing that pistol at me without saying a word. The other guy was still talking, low and agitated.{&1310}\par "That wasn't what we were told to do," he grunted into his comm. "I don't care if you-" whoever it was cut him off abruptly and he started pacing. I didn't take my eyes off the gun pointed at me but I could hear the other one's boots clomping back and forth as he paced. I could tell he was limping slightly.{&1310}\par "Let's get one thing straight, fuckhead -- I \i don't\i0  take orders from you. If you don't have a way out, then we'll just have to take our chances with the head instead of the whole body. He told me that was enough and a helluva lot better than nothing."{&1310}\par I tried to make sense of that, but there was none. This whole thing didn't make sense, I started to realize as I finally got a chance to sit there and think about it. But it just made desperation creep up inside me as I started to wonder if they were just going to kill me after all.{&1310}\par "You just do your fucking job and let me do mine now that you've fucked it up," that other one was growling, still trying to keep his voice down but not doing a very good job of it. The thought dawned on me that these guys might not have been after me at all really, but Dad. It was the only thing that made sense.{&1310}\par "Whatever." The call terminated. "Dumb prick." And that other one finally turned back to us.{&1310}\par "Well?" the knife guy finally asked, but his voice was flat. Dispassionate. He never took his eyes off me on the ground and I felt my skin crawl underneath it. The other one sighed.{&1310}\par "He's fucking useless. Couldn't get the clearance to clear a path."{&1310}\par "We can't take her with us then," the creepy one said, and I felt a sudden surge of hope. Whatever the hell was going on here, they'd botched it somehow and couldn't take me with them. The fact that they'd been going to kidnap me in the first place was only slightly more comforting than the original thought that they were just going to kill me. But then why hadn't he just shot me when I tried to run? Unless he couldn't. Even if he had meant to kill me, he hadn't bothered to shoot that poor drunk. Just bludgeon him to death.{&1310}\par "Don't you think I know that? He said he only needed the head."{&1310}\par "So?"{&1310}\par "So why don't you get your hacksaw? Can you do that? \i Please\i0 ?" the one who'd tried to shoot me first asked with too much exasperated sarcasm. The creepy guy, in turn, just cocked his head to one side ad got off the bed.{&1310}\par \i Wait\i0 . \i What the fuck?\i0 {&1310}\par "Don't you fucking move, little girl."{&1310}\par The mouthy one had his gun trained on me now from behind. I noticed the other guy digging in a pack he had on the floor to one side. I didn't like what I was seeing come out.{&1310}\par I got up with my hands over my head, pleading.{&1310}\par "Please, \i don't\i0 ! You don't have to do this -- what do you want from me? You don't have to kill me -- \i please\i0 !"{&1310}\par It all came out in a violent, desperate rush.{&1310}\par The guy with the gun on me -- he was taller than the other one, with long, rough and dull brown hair limping down past his jaw and his untrimmed, full-faced beard -- he just took a step forward and shoved a boot in my guts.{&1310}\par I was dimly aware of dry-heaving on the deck a little while later, my face almost kissing carpet. Saliva trailed down from my mouth and my insides felt like they were coming apart. Eventually, I couldn't hold myself upright any longer and I flopped down on my side, cradling those shards of glass inside my stomach.{&1310}\par "Hey."{&1310}\par A head swam above me.{&1310}\par "Heyheyhey."{&1310}\par Then a hand was buried in my hair. It started pulling and pain shot through my scalp like it would rip right off. I grabbed that hand with both of mine and it yanked me partially up off the floor.{&1310}\par I was looking into the bearded guy's face then, baring my teeth. I wish it was because I was filled with rage and death-defying defiance, ready to spinkick my way right through him. No. It just fucking hurt. \i Everything\i0  hurt. He smiled at me.{&1310}\par "My friend's going to take just a little bit off the top here," he said, still with that lop-sided grin that said "cat playing with a mouse," and jabbed a finger into my neck. The gun replaced his finger a second later, forcing my chin up.{&1310}\par My eyes drifted sideways towarad that other one pulling out what looked like one of those hand-held, molecular-bladed bonesaws the medical officers kept in their emergency kits for field amputations. I felt tears slip down both of my cheeks, looking at it. Where was Dad? I was going to die -- right \i here\i0  -- and he wouldn't even know until long after these two were gone. And I couldn't help thinking that it was all my fault for ever letting him kick me out in the first place.{&1310}\par Why hadn't I gone to see Tess?{&1310}\par Why had I run away from Mills?{&1310}\par Why.{&1310}\par Why.{&1310}\par WHY!{&1310}\par "Hold her down," the knife guy said, and hopped over toward us.

"I don't have a formal ID number yet, I haven't been commissioned!" And I probably never would.{&1310}\par There was a long pause, and I got the impression that whoever it was might have been trying to look me up or otherwise figure out who the hell I was. If there was actual fighting on the station ... there was no telling \i what\i0  they might be thinking.\cf2\f1 {&1310}\par }{&1310}

You don't have to kill me -- \i please\i0 !"{&1310}\par It all came out in a violent, desperate rush.{&1310}\par The guy with the gun on me -- he was taller than the other one, with long, rough and dull brown hair limping down past his jaw and his untrimmed, full-faced beard -- he just took a step forward and shoved a boot in my guts.{&1310}\par I was dimly aware of dry-heaving on the deck a little while later, my face almost kissing carpet. Saliva trailed down from my mouth and my insides felt like they were coming apart. Eventually, I couldn't hold myself upright any longer and I flopped down on my side, cradling those shards of glass inside my stomach.{&1310}\par "Hey."{&1310}\par A head swam above me.{&1310}\par "Heyheyhey."{&1310}\par Then a hand was buried in my hair. It started pulling and pain shot through my scalp like it would rip right off. I grabbed that hand with both of mine and it yanked me partially up off the floor.{&1310}\par I was looking into the bearded guy's face then, baring my teeth. I wish it was because I was filled with rage and death-defying defiance, ready to spinkick my way right through him. No. It just fucking hurt. \i Everything\i0  hurt. He smiled at me.{&1310}\par "My friend's going to take just a little bit off the top here," he said, still with that lop-sided grin that said "cat playing with a mouse," and jabbed a finger into my neck. The gun replaced his finger a second later, forcing my chin up.{&1310}\par My eyes drifted sideways towarad that other one pulling out what looked like one of those hand-held, molecular-bladed bonesaws the medical officers kept in their emergency kits for field amputations. I felt tears slip down both of my cheeks, looking at it. Where was Dad? I was going to die -- right \i here\i0  -- and he wouldn't even know until long after these two were gone. And I couldn't help thinking that it was all my fault for ever letting him kick me out in the first place.{&1310}\par Why hadn't I gone to see Tess?{&1310}\par Why had I run away from Mills?{&1310}\par Why.{&1310}\par Why.{&1310}\par WHY!{&1310}\par "Hold her down," the knife guy said, and hopped over toward us. He pushed a button and a shimmering blue blade came to life in the saw.{&1310}\par And so did the station alarms.{&1310}\par Everything stopped. Klaxons blared overhead, the lights dimmed and flashed red. Those two guys both looked sharply up and around, shocked and pissed all at once.{&1310}\par "Fuck!"{&1310}\par "... He didn't ..."{&1310}\par They dropped me, but I didn't hit the ground. At least, I didn't feel it. Something tugged at the back of my brain instead.{&1310}\par "Too early. He's too fucking early!"{&1310}\par "We need to move ..."{&1310}\par "Fuck! No. Grab her first!"{&1310}\par They came back to me. I didn't even notice. Something was wrong.{&1310}\par With me.{&1310}\par With everything.{&1310}\par I felt it all start coming apart.{&1310}\par That tugging at something inside my head got more insistent. I looked down, and I was on my hands and knees. The wire around my legs was loose and I kicked my way out of it without feeling. That's when I realized those two were staring at me.{&1310}\par A gun flashed in front of my face. Mohawk guy. I watched him bare his teeth and waited for the end ... but he just kept on staring like he had been. There was a flicker of ... something in his cold, dead eyes. The other one was agape.{&1310}\par That tug was physical now too. I felt my clothes pulling me backwards toward nothing. My bed? I tried to look around, but everything felt heavy and slow -- like I was stuck trying to run inside a dream.{&1310}\par Then that something inside my head snapped, and everything folded in on itself until there was only black.{&1310}\par {&1310}\par {&1310}\par Red warning lights were blinking in my face.{&1310}\par I winced, and tried to open my eyes. Everything was black laced with bright red and, for a second, I had no idea where I was.{&1310}\par Then, I remembered.{&1310}\par I was floating. I had no idea how fast I was moving, but that blaring HUD screaming "NO TETHER DETECTED" at me told me all I ever needed to know.{&1310}\par ... To freak the fuck out.{&1310}\par I'd hit the emergency airlock release on my borrowed suit in a panic and been catapulted out into empty space. A whole new kind of panic gripped me now.{&1310}\par I flailed, and started to spin. Blood thundered in my ears. There was nothing but the sound of my suddenly desperate, ragged breathing in the silence of the suit. My faceplate was still splattered with black sludge from that melting corpse and all I could see was the outline of void whirling around me. I started to scream.{&1310}\par That didn't slow me down at all.{&1310}\par How long was I out?{&1310}\par How far had I \i gone\i0  ...?{&1310}\par I couldn't see the station. I couldn't see anything!{&1310}\par WARNING: RAPID OXYGEN DEPLETION{&1310}\par My HUD howled at me again, lighting up in bright, disturbingly visible letters. I was hyperventilating, alternating between sucking in all the air I could and shrieking at the top of my lungs at nothing. No one would hear me.{&1310}\par Where was Dad?{&1310}\par Where was that voice?{&1310}\par Where was \i anyone\i0  ...?{&1310}\par "HELP ME!" I screamed at all of them and tried to pound empty space with my fists. My rotation changed.{&1310}\par I fumbled at my wrist. I couldn't see anything past that slime and pawed furiously at my faceplate instead. It didn't budge.{&1310}\par I remembered the voice activation command for internal comm and screamed it unintelligibly twice before I got it to turn on.{&1310}\par "Somebody -- \i anybody\i0  -- I'm outisde and I can't see anything and I don't know I am please-"{&1310}\par I word vomitted, sobbing into that open mic. My stomac felt sick and I thought I might throw up for the millionth time that day. How much could possibly be left? Who knew if I was even still in range of the station? Who knew if anyone was even still \i alive \i0 ...?{&1310}\par "Please ... I need help, I'm ..." I begged. To no one.{&1310}\par Something hit me.{&1310}\par My heart lurched, my whole body spinning around head-over-heels. Gray-almost-black flashed in solid angles at the edges of my faceplate -- just enough to tell me it was something apart from vacuum. {&1310}\par I cried out in surprise, flipping over. My arms flew out grasping. I caught something and held on as hard as I could. I had no idea how fast I'd been going, but I got a good idea with how violently I swung around and smashed chest-first into something solid. For a few seconds I couldn't breath. But I still hung on.{&1310}\par WARNING: RAPID OXYGEN DEPLETION went from red to yellow to white beofre I could breathe again, then spiked to yellow for about a minute. My left hand was a vicious claw wrapped around metal scaffolding I couldn't see and dark metal plates winked at the edges of my faceplate around that black sludge. I just sort of hung there for a long while, tethered by one arm and floating, relief washing over my whole body like a warm blanket. And I tried to forget the frenzied thought of flying off into empty void until I asphyxiated. Alone. Forgotten.{&1310}\par Dad came back to mind.{&1310}\par I'd been going too fast and too long after careening out of that airlock. I don't think he'd meant for me to do that when he'd led me there -- \i if\i0  he'd led me there. Well ... I'd gotten out, hadn't I? But I shouldn't have hit the station. I should have been floating off forever into black.{&1310}\par So what had I hit then?{&1310}\par I brought my free hand around and tried to swipe at that slime on my faceplate again. It had frozen and I ended up clawing at ice. A few minutes of that and I was growling blindly at it, duraflex suit gloves completely fucking useless.{&1310}\par Wait.{&1310}\par I had an angry, desperate sort of idea that only came so close to bashing my own head against a bulkhead. I yanked myself close to whatever that thing was I was holding nto and found the edge of the metal in my hand that had been trying to dig into my other glove the whole while. I lined up my faceplat against that with both hands now and start to scrape.{&1310}\par It worked!{&1310}\par Kind of.{&1310}\par That stuff started to break off in chunks and squirm away. I laughed a shaky laugh into my faceplate, forgetting how disgusting all of that really was. I could see!{&1310}\par Just in time to notice the huge chunks of metal rocketing overhead.{&1310}\par My body lurched on reflex, breath half catching in my throat, half tearing out of it in a another strangled cry of surprise. That was the only sound I heard as huge things screamed overhead, venting thrust and atmosphere into space while I flopped around right beneath them. Thank god I didn't let go.{&1310}\par It stopped almost as abruptly as it had started. Those things shooting out overhead. And they \i were\i0  shooting. It took my too stressed, tired, and fear-soaked brain too long to realize where they were going. Or what they were. Or what was even happening.{&1310}\par Boarding pods.{&1310}\par The station.{&1310}\par Riftwatch was being attacked.{&1310}\par And somehow ... some ridiculously laughable way -- \i I\i0  was hanging onto an enemy ship.{&1310}\par My eyes fixed to the hull beneath me -- or beside me. I assumed I'd been hanging up and down, but now that I could see the station I realized I was really at a dizzyingly upturned angle. My stomach lurched into my throat before I could focus enough to stabilize my sense of direction.{&1310}\par Then my eyes inevitably slipped back toward the station. \i Home\i0 .{&1310}\par I was immediately reminded of coming in what must have been only yesterday morning, staring at that same sight from beside Miller. Except this time I was dangling from an enemy ship in space. Watching boarding pods crash into the station's hull.{&1310}\par What struck me first was how dim and spotty the lights looked. Like the power was failing in more places than just that research tower I'd been in. Reminded of that place I'd been ejected out of -- I found it, stabbing up out of the station's riftward side like a dead, metal finger.{&1310}\par "God ..."{&1310}\par "... hello?"{&1310}\par Static.{&1310}\par I blinked, so in shock to hear someone else's voice that I forgot my grip on the hull of that ship and started to drift away for a second.{&1310}\par "... Hello? Come in. Who's on this frequency?"{&1310}\par I scrambled to grab a hold of the hull again.{&1310}\par "H-hello!" I practically shouted into my comm. I'd forgotten all about it, and I'd been breathing, screaming, gasping, and grunting into open frequency for the past few minutes without caring. Who \i did \i0 care? Someone had heard me!{&1310}\par "Who is this? ID number \i now\i0  marine. You're supposed to be at dead comms."{&1310}\par "This is-is Evelyn Weir, I'm" I started babbling fiercely at that voice on the other end. I didn't care who it was, as long as they could help me. "I don't have a formal ID number yet, I haven't been commissioned!" And I probably never would.{&1310}\par There was a long pause, and I got the impression that whoever it was might have been trying to look me up or otherwise figure out who the hell I was. If there was actual fighting on the station ... there was no telling \i what\i0  they might be thinking. {&1310}\par But I sat there for what felt like so long, waiting in that floating purgatory for some word of rescue. The image of them ignoring me altogeher while a desperate battle raged on crept into my head.{&1310}\par "Please, I need he-" I started shouting at them abruptly again -- hating myself for not caring about anyone else just then -- but got cut off by that same voice over the comm.{&1310}\par "Your name again?"{&1310}\par And I breathed an audible sigh of relief. I didn't even notice that subtle change of tone. Or care.{&1310}\par "Evelyn Weir," I told what sounded like a woman over the spotty frequency. It didn't sound weak -- just like there might have been a lot of interference. But she must have compensated on her end because it startewd coming through crystal clear.{&1310}\par "Hold on, please."{&1310}\par "I-" I caught myself, unsure of what to say to that. I guess I already \i was\i0  holding on? I looked at the ship's hull and tried to put my other hand through to rub my forehead but only bumped into faceplate. I just needed someone to come get me! How hard could that be? I didn't even want to \i think\i0  about what it would mean to be left alone out here too long. Those creepy monsters back in the research tower were beginning to almost seem more appealing than suffocating to death.{&1310}\par Or ... no. Getting eaten was still worse.{&1310}\par How had this leave gone from fretting over dad noticing me and failing out of the academy to debating what was the worst way to die? Poor life decisions, I guess.{&1310}\par It was sometime while just sitting there waiting for my lifeline to come back that panic died down and some sense returned. Enough, anyways, to remember those pods.\cf2\f1 {&1310}\par }{&1310}

He stared at me while the other one kept talking into his comm to someone else. It was the first time I'd actually gotten a good look at either of them, and that one who'd chased me down sure looked like he'd be into attacking people in their own quarters in the middle of the night. He had a roughly trimmed beard and head except for a short mohawk spike of hair sticking up the middle like a buzzsaw out of the top of his skull. Scars crisscrossed the stubble on either side of his scalp with one really big, ugly one cutting down over his left eyebrow. I think he was wearing combat armor plating underneath that heavy, brown coat hanging down and not doing much to hide the fact that he was mostly corded muscle beneath that. While I stared back, he put his knife to the other side of his face and just kept staring at me with this dead-eyed, calculating look.{&1310}\par "What do you want?" I started to ask, my voice barely quavering. But he cut me off by bouncing his gun down and pointing it straight at my head. My eyes snapped shut and I threw my hands in front of my face, waiting for a blinding pain and flash of light, but ... nothing came. I tentatively opened my eyes a couple seconds later and he was just sitting there pointing that pistol at me without saying a word. The other guy was still talking, low and agitated.{&1310}\par "That wasn't what we were told to do," he grunted into his comm. "I don't care if you-" whoever it was cut him off abruptly and he started pacing. I didn't take my eyes off the gun pointed at me but I could hear the other one's boots clomping back and forth as he paced. I could tell he was limping slightly.{&1310}\par "Let's get one thing straight, fuckhead -- I \i don't\i0  take orders from you. If you don't have a way out, then we'll just have to take our chances with the head instead of the whole body. He told me that was enough and a helluva lot better than nothing."{&1310}\par I tried to make sense of that, but there was none. This whole thing didn't make sense, I started to realize as I finally got a chance to sit there and think about it. But it just made desperation creep up inside me as I started to wonder if they were just going to kill me after all.{&1310}\par "You just do your fucking job and let me do mine now that you've fucked it up," that other one was growling, still trying to keep his voice down but not doing a very good job of it. The thought dawned on me that these guys might not have been after me at all really, but Dad. It was the only thing that made sense.{&1310}\par "Whatever." The call terminated. "Dumb prick." And that other one finally turned back to us.{&1310}\par "Well?" the knife guy finally asked, but his voice was flat. Dispassionate. He never took his eyes off me on the ground and I felt my skin crawl underneath it. The other one sighed.{&1310}\par "He's fucking useless. Couldn't get the clearance to clear a path."{&1310}\par "We can't take her with us then," the creepy one said, and I felt a sudden surge of hope. Whatever the hell was going on here, they'd botched it somehow and couldn't take me with them. The fact that they'd been going to kidnap me in the first place was only slightly more comforting than the original thought that they were just going to kill me. But then why hadn't he just shot me when I tried to run? Unless he couldn't. Even if he had meant to kill me, he hadn't bothered to shoot that poor drunk. Just bludgeon him to death.{&1310}\par "Don't you think I know that? He said he only needed the head."{&1310}\par "So?"{&1310}\par "So why don't you get your hacksaw? Can you do that? \i Please\i0 ?" the one who'd tried to shoot me first asked with too much exasperated sarcasm. The creepy guy, in turn, just cocked his head to one side ad got off the bed.{&1310}\par \i Wait\i0 . \i What the fuck?\i0 {&1310}\par "Don't you fucking move, little girl."{&1310}\par The mouthy one had his gun trained on me now from behind. I noticed the other guy digging in a pack he had on the floor to one side. I didn't like what I was seeing come out.{&1310}\par I got up with my hands over my head, pleading.{&1310}\par "Please, \i don't\i0 ! You don't have to do this -- what do you want from me?

Reminded of that place I'd been ejected out of -- I found it, stabbing up out of the station's riftward side like a dead, metal finger.{&1310}\par "God ..."{&1310}\par "... hello?"{&1310}\par Static.{&1310}\par I blinked, so in shock to hear someone else's voice that I forgot my grip on the hull of that ship and started to drift away for a second.{&1310}\par "... Hello? Come in. Who's on this frequency?"{&1310}\par I scrambled to grab a hold of the hull again.{&1310}\par "H-hello!" I practically shouted into my comm. I'd forgotten all about it, and I'd been breathing, screaming, gasping, and grunting into open frequency for the past few minutes without caring. Who \i did \i0 care? Someone had heard me!{&1310}\par "Who is this? ID number \i now\i0  marine. You're supposed to be at dead comms."{&1310}\par "This is-is Evelyn Weir, I'm" I started babbling fiercely at that voice on the other end. I didn't care who it was, as long as they could help me. "I don't have a formal ID number yet, I haven't been commissioned!" And I probably never would.{&1310}\par There was a long pause, and I got the impression that whoever it was might have been trying to look me up or otherwise figure out who the hell I was. If there was actual fighting on the station ... there was no telling \i what\i0  they might be thinking. {&1310}\par But I sat there for what felt like so long, waiting in that floating purgatory for some word of rescue. The image of them ignoring me altogeher while a desperate battle raged on crept into my head.{&1310}\par "Please, I need he-" I started shouting at them abruptly again -- hating myself for not caring about anyone else just then -- but got cut off by that same voice over the comm.{&1310}\par "Your name again?"{&1310}\par And I breathed an audible sigh of relief. I didn't even notice that subtle change of tone. Or care.{&1310}\par "Evelyn Weir," I told what sounded like a woman over the spotty frequency. It didn't sound weak -- just like there might have been a lot of interference. But she must have compensated on her end because it startewd coming through crystal clear.{&1310}\par "Hold on, please."{&1310}\par "I-" I caught myself, unsure of what to say to that. I guess I already \i was\i0  holding on? I looked at the ship's hull and tried to put my other hand through to rub my forehead but only bumped into faceplate. I just needed someone to come get me! How hard could that be? I didn't even want to \i think\i0  about what it would mean to be left alone out here too long. Those creepy monsters back in the research tower were beginning to almost seem more appealing than suffocating to death.{&1310}\par Or ... no. Getting eaten was still worse.{&1310}\par How had this leave gone from fretting over dad noticing me and failing out of the academy to debating what was the worst way to die? Poor life decisions, I guess.{&1310}\par It was sometime while just sitting there waiting for my lifeline to come back that panic died down and some sense returned. Enough, anyways, to remember those pods.{&1310}\par I was too far away from the station to see, but they could only have meant fighting. An attack. Who? Pirates? There was no way pirates could have gotten this close and through all the regional defenses. Tau? Maybe, but Riftwatch was far from the borders of their space, and they were getting further away with each year. It wasn't a great target to open a new war on if that's what was happening.{&1310}\par I kept looking at those pods. Then I slowly came back around to where they had shot out. I was hugging an enemy ship. There was no wa they were friendlies with everything I had already seen. Right?{&1310}\par How far away I'd flown from the station really started to dawn on me then. I'd been shouting into an open frequency, but who would be listening for it if they were under attack? \i Especially\i0  if anywhere else was half as bad as what I'd seen in the research tower.{&1310}\par She'd thought I was a marine.{&1310}\par Station military details wouldn't be broadcasting out this far if they were under attack ...{&1310}\par "Excuse me ... Miss Weir?"{&1310}\par Right?{&1310}\par "Miss Weir, are you still there?"{&1310}\par I noticed that change in tone now. She'd been clipped, impatient -- professional, the way an ops command comms officer might be -- before. Now she was polite, still impatient, but in a more eager or desperate way and was trying to keep that in check like she wanted something. From \i me\i0 .{&1310}\par A command deck comms officer would be someone maybe listening for chatter on short-range frequencies. Right? A comms officer that was part of the attack.{&1310}\par "Miss Weir?"{&1310}\par "... yeah?"{&1310}\par "I asked if you could please tell me where you are so I can send someone to come get you."{&1310}\par \i Oh my god I'm talking to the enemy.\i0 {&1310}\par  "Is something wrong?" that too-nice voice nagged me on again. I'd been staring at the ship in shock and must've givern her soem long, awkward pauses.{&1310}\par "Uhhh, no. Nothing," I stammered. "The situation resolved itself." And I promptly switched my comm right off.{&1310}\par I floated there for a few seconds, heart racing. Knowing they could probably trace the origin of my signal if they wanted to. And it sounded like they would.{&1310}\par She'd gotten weird about it as soon as she'd looked up my name. If those memories hadn't come trickling back, I wouldn't have noticed or even cared, but they had. Those two men had been trying to get to me back on the station. Mohawk and Beardface. Why had they wanted me? No idea. But it wasn't at all just paranoid to make a connection between that attempted kidnapping{&47}murder and those people attacking the station.{&1310}\par Wait.{&1310}\par They couldn't just be looking for \i me\i0 , could they?{&1310}\par No. No, that would be \i crazy \i0 ...{&1310}\par As crazy as two guys trying to kidnap me in th emiddle of the night?{&1310}\par No. It was \i way\i0  crazier than that even. Like, by a \i lot\i0 . Attacking the whole \i station\i0 ? A guarded military research station? No freaking way I was worth that much to \i anyone\i0 .{&1310}\par The thought made me laugh out of context. Wow, that would've been flattering in a weird way.{&1310}\par Dad. They must have been after dad. Me? I wasn't important enough. Dr. Nolan Weir, though ... retired \i Admiral\i0  Dr. Nolan Weir, though ...{&1310}\par Who knew what he was working on. Or how important it could be. They'd use me to get to him. It made the only sense.{&1310}\par God ... if this was all just some infighting between Grand Admirals over competing science experiments, I'd --{&1310}\par \i What? There's nothing you can do.\i0 {&1310}\par What were a few dead scientists next to a Grand Admiral. Or even a few thousand.{&1310}\par I just kept floating there, with paralytic thoughts too big for my non-existent rank and clearance.{&1310}\par Had I really said that to the enemy comms officer? "Situation resolved?" That was a weird lie. I hoped it confused her as much as it did me for being the first thing to pop out of my mouth pseudo-automatically. It had been a joke back at the academy. The thing cadets in my training unit would always say if they approached{&1310}\par {&1310}\par {&1310}\par Maybe I should've just surrendered myself. Maybe I should just get back on the comms and save them the trouble, mentioning "oh and by the way, I'm floating right outside your podbay doors." It's not like I was any good at this \cf2\f1 {&1310}\par }{&1310}

He stared at me while the other one kept talking into his comm to someone else. It was the first time I'd actually gotten a good look at either of them, and that one who'd chased me down sure looked like he'd be into attacking people in their own quarters in the middle of the night. He had a roughly trimmed beard and head, except for a short mohawk spike of hair sticking up from the middle like a buzzsaw out of the top of his skull. Scars crisscrossed the stubble on either side of his scalp with one really big, \i ugly \i0 one cutting down over his left eyebrow. I think he was wearing combat armor plating underneath that heavy, brown coat hanging down and not doing much to hide the fact that he was mostly corded muscle beneath that. While I stared back, he put his knife to the other side of his face and just kept staring at me with this dead-eyed, calculating look.{&1310}\par "What do you want?" I started to ask, my voice -- thankfully -- barely quavering. But he cut me off by bouncing his gun down and pointing it straight at my head. My eyes snapped shut and I threw my hands in front of my face, waiting for a blinding pain and flash of light, but ... nothing came. I tentatively opened my eyes a couple seconds later and he was just sitting there pointing that pistol at me without saying a word. The other guy was still talking, low and agitated.{&1310}\par "That wasn't what we were told to do," he grunted into his comm. "I don't care if you-" whoever it was cut him off abruptly and he started pacing. I didn't take my eyes off the gun pointed at me but I could hear the other one's boots clomping back and forth as he paced. I could tell he was limping slightly.{&1310}\par "Let's get one thing straight, fuckhead -- I \i don't\i0  take orders from you. If you don't have a way out, then we'll just have to take our chances with the head instead of the whole body. He told me that was enough and a helluva lot better than nothing."{&1310}\par I tried to make sense of that, but there was none. This whole thing didn't make sense, I started to realize as I finally got a chance to sit there and think about it. But it just made desperation creep up inside me as I started to wonder if they were just going to kill me after all.{&1310}\par "You just do your fucking job and let me do mine now that you've fucked it up," that other one was growling, still trying to keep his voice down but not doing a very good job of it. The thought dawned on me that these guys might not have been after me at all really, but Dad. It was the only thing that made sense.{&1310}\par "Whatever." The call terminated. "Dumb prick." And that other one finally turned back to us.{&1310}\par "Well?" the knife guy finally asked, but his voice was flat. Dispassionate. He never took his eyes off me on the ground and I felt my skin crawl underneath it. The other one sighed.{&1310}\par "He's fucking useless. Couldn't get the clearance to clear a path."{&1310}\par "We can't take her with us then," the creepy one said, and I felt a sudden surge of hope. Whatever the hell was going on here, they'd botched it somehow and couldn't take me with them. The fact that they'd been going to kidnap me in the first place was only slightly more comforting than the original thought that they were just going to kill me. But then why hadn't he just shot me when I tried to run? Unless he couldn't. Even if he had meant to kill me, he hadn't bothered to shoot that poor drunk marine. Just bludgeon him to death.{&1310}\par "Don't you think I know that? He said he only needed the head."{&1310}\par "So?"{&1310}\par "So why don't you get your hacksaw? Can you do that? \i Please\i0 ?" the one who'd tried to shoot me first asked with too much exasperated sarcasm. The creepy guy, in turn, just cocked his head to one side ad got off the bed.{&1310}\par \i Wait\i0 . \i What the fuck?\i0 {&1310}\par "Don't you fucking move, little girl."{&1310}\par The mouthy one had his gun trained on me now from behind. I noticed the other guy digging in a pack he had on the floor to one side. I didn't like what I was seeing come out.{&1310}\par I got up with my hands over my head, pleading.{&1310}\par "Ohgodpleasedon'tkillme!"{&1310}\par It all came out in a violent, desperate rush.{&1310}\par The guy with the gun on me -- he was taller than the other one, with long, rough and dull brown hair limping down past his jaw and his untrimmed, full-faced beard -- he just took a step forward and shoved a boot in my guts.{&1310}\par I was dimly aware of dry-heaving on the deck a little while later, my face almost kissing carpet. Saliva trailed down from my mouth and my insides felt like they were coming apart. Eventually, I couldn't hold myself upright any longer and I flopped down on my side, cradling those shards of glass inside my stomach.{&1310}\par "Hey."{&1310}\par A head swam above me.{&1310}\par "Heyheyhey."{&1310}\par Then a hand was buried in my hair. It started pulling and pain shot through my scalp like it would rip right off. I grabbed that hand with both of mine and it yanked me partially up off the floor.{&1310}\par I was looking into the bearded guy's face then, baring my teeth. I wish it was because I was filled with rage and death-defying defiance, ready to spinkick my way right through him. No. It just fucking hurt. \i Everything\i0  hurt. He smiled at me.{&1310}\par "My friend's going to take just a little bit off the top here," he said, still with that lop-sided grin that said "cat playing with a mouse," and jabbed a finger into my neck. The gun replaced his finger a second later, and he snapped my head back so I was looking up at him.{&1310}\par My eyes drifted sideways toward that other one pulling out what looked like one of those hand-held, molecular-bladed bonesaws the medical officers kept in their emergency kits for field amputations. I felt tears slip down both of my cheeks, looking at it. Where was Dad? I was going to die -- right \i here\i0  -- and he wouldn't even know until long after these two were gone. And I couldn't help thinking that it was all my fault for ever letting him kick me out in the first place.{&1310}\par Why hadn't I gone to see Tess?{&1310}\par Why had I run away from Mills?{&1310}\par Why.{&1310}\par Why.{&1310}\par WHY!{&1310}\par "Hold her down," the knife guy said, and moved back over toward us. He pushed a button and a shimmering blue blade came to life in the saw.{&1310}\par And so did the station alarms.{&1310}\par Everything stopped. Klaxons blared overhead, the lights dimmed too much, came back slightly, and flashed red. Those two guys both looked sharply up and around, shocked and pissed all at once.{&1310}\par "Fuck!"{&1310}\par "... He didn't ..."{&1310}\par They dropped me, but I didn't hit the ground. At least, I didn't feel it. Something tugged at the back of my brain instead.{&1310}\par "Too early. He's too fucking early!"{&1310}\par "We need to move ..."{&1310}\par "Fuck! No. Grab her first!"{&1310}\par They came back to me. I didn't even notice. Something was wrong.{&1310}\par With me.{&1310}\par With everything.{&1310}\par I felt it all start coming apart.{&1310}\par That tugging at something inside my head got more insistent. I looked down, and I was on my hands and knees. The wire around my legs was loose and I kicked my way out of it without feeling. That's when I realized those two were staring at me.{&1310}\par No. Something behind me.{&1310}\par They didn't forget me, though.{&1310}\par A gun flashed in front of my face. Mohawk guy. I watched him bare his teeth and waited for the end ... but he just kept on staring like he had been. There was a flicker of ... something in his cold, dead eyes. The other one was agape.{&1310}\par That tug was physical now too. I felt my clothes pulling me backwards toward nothing. My bed? I tried to look around, but everything felt heavy and slow -- like I was stuck trying to run inside a dream.{&1310}\par Then that something inside my head snapped, and everything folded in on itself until there was only black.{&1310}\par {&1310}\par {&1310}\par Red warning lights were blinking in my face.{&1310}\par I winced, and tried to open my eyes. Everything was black laced with bright red and, for a second, I had no idea where I was.{&1310}\par Then, I remembered.{&1310}\par I was floating. I had no idea how fast I was moving, but that blaring HUD screaming "NO TETHER DETECTED" at me told me all I ever needed to know.{&1310}\par ... To freak the fuck out.{&1310}\par I'd hit the emergency airlock release on my borrowed suit in a panic and been catapulted out into empty space. A whole new kind of panic gripped me now.{&1310}\par I flailed, and started to spin. Blood thundered in my ears. There was nothing but the sound of my suddenly desperate, ragged breathing in the silence of the suit. My faceplate was still splattered with black sludge from that melting corpse and all I could see was the outline of void whirling around me. I started to scream.{&1310}\par That didn't slow me down at all.{&1310}\par How long was I out?{&1310}\par How far had I \i gone\i0  ...?{&1310}\par I couldn't see the station. I couldn't see anything!{&1310}\par WARNING: RAPID OXYGEN DEPLETION{&1310}\par My HUD howled at me again, lighting up in bright, disturbingly visible letters. I was hyperventilating, alternating between sucking in all the air I could and shrieking at the top of my lungs at nothing. No one would hear me.{&1310}\par Where was Dad?{&1310}\par Where was that voice?{&1310}\par Where was \i anyone\i0  ...?{&1310}\par "HELP ME!" I screamed at all of them and tried to pound empty space with my fists. My rotation changed.{&1310}\par I fumbled at my wrist. I couldn't see anything past that slime and pawed furiously at my faceplate instead. It didn't budge.{&1310}\par I remembered the voice activation command for internal comms and screamed it unintelligibly twice before I got it to turn on.{&1310}\par "Somebody -- \i anybody\i0  -- I'moutsideandIcan'tseeanythingandIdon'tknowwhereIamplease-"{&1310}\par I word vomitted, sobbing into that open mic. My stomach felt sick and I thought I might throw up for the millionth time that day. How much could possibly be left? Who knew if I was even still in range of the station? Who knew if anyone was even still \i alive \i0 ...?{&1310}\par "Please ... I need help, I'm ..." I begged. To no one.{&1310}\par Something hit me.{&1310}\par My heart lurched, my whole body spinning around head-over-heels. Gray-almost-black flashed in solid angles at the edges of my faceplate -- just enough to tell me it was something apart from vacuum. {&1310}\par I cried out in surprise, flipping over. My arms flew out grasping. I caught something and held on as hard as I could. I had no idea how fast I'd been going, but I got a good idea with how violently I swung around and smashed chest-first into something solid. For a few seconds I couldn't breath. But I still hung on.{&1310}\par WARNING: RAPID OXYGEN DEPLETION went from red to yellow to white before I could breathe again, then spiked to yellow for about a minute while I wondered in a daze if my faceplate would crack open. My left hand was a vicious claw wrapped around metal scaffolding I couldn't see and dark metal plates winked at the edges of my faceplate around that black sludge. I just sort of hung there for a long while, tethered by one arm and floating, relief washing over my whole body like a warm blanket. And I tried to forget the frenzied thought of flying off into empty void until I asphyxiated. Alone. Forgotten.{&1310}\par Dad came back to mind.{&1310}\par I'd been going too fast and too long after careening out of that airlock. I don't think he'd meant for me to do that when he'd led me there -- \i if\i0  he'd led me there. Well ... I'd gotten out, hadn't I? But I shouldn't have hit the station. I should have been floating off forever into black.{&1310}\par So what had I hit then?{&1310}\par I brought my free hand around and tried to swipe at that slime on my faceplate again. It had frozen and I ended up clawing at ice. A few minutes of that and I was growling blindly at it, duraflex suit gloves completely fucking useless.{&1310}\par Wait.{&1310}\par I had an angry, desperate sort of idea that only came so close to bashing my own head against metal again. I yanked myself close to whatever that thing was I was holding onto and found the edge of the metal in my hand that had been trying to dig into my other glove the whole while. I lined up my faceplate against that with both hands now and start to scrape.{&1310}\par And it worked!{&1310}\par Sort of.{&1310}\par That stuff started to break off in chunks and squirm away. I laughed a shaky laugh into my faceplate, forgetting how disgusting all of that really was. I could see!{&1310}\par Just in time to notice the huge chunks of metal rocketing overhead.{&1310}\par My body lurched on reflex, breath half catching in my throat, half tearing out of it in a another strangled cry of surprise. That was the only sound I heard as huge things screamed overhead, venting thrust and atmosphere into space while I flopped around right beneath them. Thank god I didn't let go.{&1310}\par It stopped almost as abruptly as it had started. Those things shooting out overhead. And they \i were\i0  shooting. It took my too stressed, tired, and fear-soaked brain too long to realize where they were going. Or what they were. Or what was even happening.{&1310}\par Boarding pods.{&1310}\par The station.{&1310}\par Riftwatch was being attacked.{&1310}\par And somehow ... some ridiculously laughable way -- \i I\i0  must've been hanging onto an enemy ship.{&1310}\par My eyes fixed to the hull beneath me -- or beside me. I assumed I'd been hanging up and down, but now that I could see the station I realized I was really at a dizzyingly upturned angle. My stomach lurched into my throat before I could focus enough to stabilize my sense of direction.{&1310}\par Then my eyes inevitably slipped back toward the station. \i Home\i0 .{&1310}\par I was immediately reminded of coming in what must have been only yesterday morning, staring at that same sight from beside Miller. Except this time I was dangling from an enemy ship in space. Watching boarding pods crash into the station's hull.{&1310}\par What struck me first was how dim and spotty the lights looked. Like the power was failing in more places than just that research tower I'd been in. And, finally reminded again of that place I'd been so desperately ejected out of -- I found it, stabbing up out of the station's riftward side like a dead, metal finger.{&1310}\par "God ..."{&1310}\par "... hello?"{&1310}\par Static.{&1310}\par I blinked, so in shock to hear someone else's voice that I forgot my grip on the hull of that ship and started to drift away for a second.{&1310}\par "... Hello? Come in. Who's on this frequency?"{&1310}\par I scrambled to grab a hold of the hull again.{&1310}\par "H-hello!" I practically shouted into my comm. I'd forgotten all about it, and I'd been breathing, screaming, gasping, and grunting into open frequency for the past few minutes without caring. Who \i did \i0 care? Someone had heard me!{&1310}\par "Who is this? ID number \i now\i0  marine. You're supposed to be at dead comms."{&1310}\par "This is-is Evelyn Weir, I'm-" I started babbling fiercely at that voice on the other end. I didn't care who it was, as long as they could help me. "I don't have a formal ID number yet, I haven't been commissioned!" And I probably never would.{&1310}\par There was a long pause, and I got the impression that whoever it was might have been trying to look me up or otherwise figure out who the hell I was. If there was actual fighting on the station ... there was no telling \i what\i0  they might be thinking. {&1310}\par Either way, it was the first \i actual\i0  human being I'd heard the voice of in what felt like forever. No monsters. No corpses. And especially no corpses that were still trying to move around, claw you apart, and fall apart themselves all over the place.{&1310}\par No, I was getting rescued.{&1310}\par I was finally -- getting -- rescued.\cf2\f1 {&1310}\par }{&1310}
