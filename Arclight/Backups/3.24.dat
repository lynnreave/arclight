But then I heard it again, and froze instead.{&1310}\par Whimpering. It crackled like the sighs of a maniac in the dark. Creaking and clicking. I could almost see those bones cracking there out of sight. Then the growling again.{&1310}\par Someone started toward me. I only realized it because some of that light bobbed and detached from the rest. I saw the glint of guns in hand and boots clapping heavily along the ground.

Firebolts went off. I ducked, pushing myself into the ground. A few went over my head and one of the men standing over me took a shot to the arm. He swore, and they forgot me.{&1310}\par It didn't last long. Those lights started to wink out or exploded. People died. I heard them torn apart like I'd heard and seen too many times before. I watched without seeing and those two men standing with me rounded back on the others.{&1310}\par "Fucking hell?"{&1310}\par "\i Shit\i0 !"{&1310}\par One of them had dropped down into a crouch, pointing his gun back at the rest and nearly falling over. The other was clutching at his shot-through arm, face blotchy and red and teeth bared at that hole in him. They ignored me completely there on the ground.{&1310}\par The wild firefight died off, and then there were only the sounds of the dead and the three of us breathing. The light from one of the others' gun rolled across the floor toward the wall and died there, slowly. Perennium wasn't supposed to ever die like that.{&1310}\par "Shit, shit, shit!" the injured one was swearing at his arm and shaking there. His snubbed rifle was hanging loose on his shoulder, forgotten too.{&1310}\par There was another second or two of that turgid quiet. The thoroughfare suddenly felt empty and dangerous. I glanced up from the ground and looked around, pistol still clutched in my hand. They hadn't gotten the chance to even notice it. I pointed it at the wounded one.{&1310}\par If I'd worried about murdering again, the choice was taken away this time. I put my finger on the trigger and that man noticed. The other one was still looking away, but he spun around with his gun as something moved in the dark. It stopped right behind the wounded man, and his shaking stopped. I didn't have to kill him. I got to watch him dismembered right in front of me instead.{&1310}\par I never saw the thing cut into him. He was just standing there one second and separated from his head, arm, and both legs the next. And I didn't see that thing turn and pounce on the other one either. I thought I was next. But the dead man's rifle just clattered down in front of me along with the rest of him on the floor. I grabbed it.{&1310}\par The other man was dead too. I didn't pay attention to how he was taken apart - I just shoved both those guns at him and started firing. The hall lit up, and blinded me.{&1310}\par The kickback on the rifle threw it wide, twisting my hand. I heard the pistol hit something, though, and I swore it was flesh. That shrieking came back. Bolts of fire flew over my head, and I squeezed myself back flat against the ground. Someone came running at me, still firing.{&1310}\par "Get up!" Julian shouted at me. He swung that flashlight he'd picked up around the hall, chasing the thing back. It vanished in the dark with a howling wail. {&1310}\par }{&1310}
