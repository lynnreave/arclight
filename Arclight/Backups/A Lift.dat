Let alone, wandering out of that wood."{&1310}\par Someone was talking. I blinked up from my half-sleep daze - more out of reflex than anything else. {&1310}\par My head felt like an overripe melon - heavy and ready to burst. It was an effort to push it up even a little. I squeezed my eyes shut, hard, trying to convince myself that I could go back to sleep as soon as that old man sitting beside me shut up. {&1310}\par "... What?"{&1310}\par "I said - it's been some time since I've seen a single person out these parts," he repeated. I even caught a little of it this time. I bobbed my head, swiping a hand at my eyes when he refused to go away and let me just collapse in on myself again.{&1310}\par "Uh huh."{&1310}\par Engines hummed loudly, rattling inside the metal hull all around us. We rolled ahead to the sound along a winding road as the sun drifted into the late morning sky. But that road was little better than gravel and dirt. It certainly wasn't making it any easier to nod off while sitting up. Another jagged hole in it jarred me abruptly up again as the whole vehicle bounced into the air. The old man gave me an apologetic look. I think he said his name was ... Anders?{&1310}\par Maybe? Whatever.{&1310}\par He replaced a pipe in between his teeth as I just sat there too tired to even be miserable and wishing that it were anything like the planetside roads I always saw in the vids. Those people driving along them were never tossed around like wet sacks, even sitting in a backwards little automotive like that. Heads back with sun-proofed glasses and opened tops -somehow, it had always seemed more ... {&1310}\par Romantic.{&1310}\par "While I've got you awake," the old man mumbled on around that pipe at me, and I shook my head aside, "I've been meanin' to ask before we get back to town. What were y'all doin' out here anyhow? Not a soul around for a hundred miles out that way that I've heard of. It's just your good fortune that I was on my way back from looking in on an old friend of mine."{&1310}\par He kept driving, though he threw a couple inquisitive looks my way.{&1310}\par "What?" I groaned out again, having a hard time following him what with running all through the day and night without any sleep. Whatever Jules had said about shorter cycles, I told his imaginary face inside my head to shove it just then.{&1310}\par His words came sluggishly back to me a few moments behind real time. And I threw my mouth open before he had to repeat himself again.{&1310}\par "We were ... we crashed out in the woods," I managed with a trying grunt. I could almost wish the Eluvian man hadn't passed out so quickly from his wounds when we just happened upon that old man in his antique vehicle. It was still the dead of night, but we saw the lights at the head of the thing for a whole kilometer off. Somehow ... somehow we had found some old backwater road after all that non-stop running through the boonies.{&1310}\par "You and that tattooed fella with the girl back there?" He nodded his head at the mirror above and between us, where he had a good look at Jules and Ev in the back seats. "You doin' all right back there, young lady?"{&1310}\par The Eluvian man was unconscious, though I couldn't tell if he was still bleeding bad. I think the run with Ev had just finally taken its toll on him after fighting that ... whatever it was, out in the woods. But Ev was awake. If you could call it that. She was staring dully out into the space outside a window back behind me. She hadn't opened her mouth or seemed to register any of us since coming back last night.{&1310}\par "She talk much?" he asked me with a cheerful wink that just made me groan with how absolutely exhausted I was. I shook my head. {&1310}\par "Nope. Never has before."{&1310}\par That thing had kept after us the whole night. I never saw it, or heard it. But I could always just kind of \i feel\i0  it behind us. I had been a wreck by the time we found the old man. Jules too, I guess. It was hard to be too grateful for Anders saving us with how he just wouldn't let me pass out, though.{&1310}\par But I guess I must have without realizing it, because another bump in the road knocked me roughly back awake and we were suddenly somewhere different. I glared out the window, confused, for a few seconds. Then I glanced back at the old man.{&1310}\par "Are those, uh, farms?" I stuck a finger toward the sprawling, plowed-looking fields out to either side of us as we drove.{&1310}\par "Sure are, young lady," he gave me another wink. {&1310}\par How long had I been passed out? I hated to think of having to run all that way on foot. So I didn't. {&1310}\par "You all on your way to Dreggoran and the Door?"{&1310}\par That confused me for a second. Everything kind of did, despite the few naps I'd had. I nodded, as much because I didn't care as I didn't know. Maybe that's where old Weir and Ev had been headed. That message I'd read in his private comm box hadn't said much about it. But ...{&1310}\par "Where are we?"{&1310}\par I rounded on the old man again, even though he'd been chattering on about something else again. I hadn't heard a word of it.{&1310}\par He frowned, interrupting whatever thought he had been chewing on with his pipe out loud. "You don't know?" he asked, surprised. But then he just shrugged it off, and gave a little wave of his hand inside that cramped cabin.{&1310}\par "Most of the out of town folks go by the name of the port - Lyricum." He smiled at me around that pipe, and flipped the red cap on his head with his free hand real quick. "Where were going is the little town of Armin, though. Just a quiet little stop near the Nickel mines on the way to the port."{&1310}\par He rattled on some more. For my part, I settled back in my seat, trying to remember everything from that message to old Weir. Something about Lyricum, I remembered. I thought there might have been something about some people staying there that were supposed to know him. I wouldn't think the transport cruiser would have stopped at a little place like that, but I hadn't been much interested in that bit anyways. Whoever sent the thing sounded like a friend. He only signed with his initials, anyways.{&1310}\par "You'll probably be wanting to head on out toward the big, old port then," he continued agreeably with another flounce of his hat and reading the unconscious Eluvian's mind, "I'd imagine. No other way to get out toward the Door."{&1310}\par Again, I nodded, staring out at those fields now. If I kept looking too hard, everything would just sort of blur out of focus and I'd catch my head drooping. I fought it off for a bit. I don't know why.{&1310}\par And the next time I woke up it was because the old man was shaking my shoulder. My eyes snapped back open, but this time I had a headache. I grabbed at my forehead with one hand, giving him a dirty look.{&1310}\par "We're here, young lady," was all he said. Then I looked up and around, and we were suddenly in some kind of dirty little town.{&1310}\par "Where the hell are we?" I asked, fighting back that throbbing in my skull. Jules was outside my hatch, though, walking away. The moment I saw that, I jerked forward, threw it open, and shouted out.{&1310}\par "Hey! Where are you going?"{&1310}\par He barely gave me more than a backward glance, striding like he hadn't collapsed on top of himself not too long ago. I got a good look at all those planetside buildings thrusting up from the ground into the sky without a care for bulkheads or running out of space in that airy emptiness, as I hurried over to pull Ev out when the Eluvian man didn't even stop. She was still staring.{&1310}\par "Damnit!" I snapped over my shoulder. "WAIT FOR US!"{&1310}\par Before I could run off, though, I remembered the old man, and rounded back on him. I ducked down inside where he was waiting with a patient look on his face.{&1310}\par "Thanks!" I uttered at him with a flash of a smile I didn't feel between my mood and my sudden headache. He smiled back, and leaned forward into the steering wheel.{&1310}\par "Don't mention it. Theresa was it? Just doin' my part." He puffed out his beard and mustaches, swiping at that pipe. "You do old Anders a favor, you hear?" He stuck it out at me. "You take care of that friend of yours."{&1310}\par I just groaned inwardly after I pulled back out, watching him drive off into that town. When had I told him \i that\i0 ? No one ever called me that. Why the hell would I tell him? I must have \i really\i0  been out of it.{&1310}\par The Eluvian man was almost out of sight, marching away into the white-washed buildings. He stood out really bad, though, and people gave him a wide berth. I guess we looked a bit out of place there too. It didn't help that we were all covered in old blood and Ev was like a corpse on her feet.{&1310}\par "Come on," I growled in Ev's ear, taking her arm in one hand. She didn't say a single thing - just kept staring off into space with those tears in her eyes. And I had to drag her to get her moving at all. {&1310}\par I groaned out loud, and hurried after Jules.\cf2 {&1310}\par }{&1310}
