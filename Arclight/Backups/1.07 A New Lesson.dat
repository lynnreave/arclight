You gonna take all the fun?"{&1310}\par "Just fucking do it, damn it."{&1310}\par "Whatever."{&1310}\par Two steps, really close. Right beside the ear. Shoes, and the reek of damp mold. Hands reaching down. They grabbed me by the arm, and my eyes snapped open.{&1310}\par That arm twisted back, free hand slipping fast into the man's face before he could blink. Crush the nose. Ankle around ankle, it took his leaning form right off his feet. He plunged face-first into the deck.{&1310}\par "Fffffukk!"{&1310}\par I rolled up and over his back. The other one was just a step away. Both legs swung around, hard, and caught him beneath the shins. He toppled with a sharp cry. I twisted away again, threw myself into the floor and pushed back up.{&1310}\par I had my feet, and they had the floor. One with a broken nose, the other scrambling to get back up. He snarled at me as he did. Peekay again. I leapt aside.{&1310}\par Air whistled past my ear. One of the lights behind winked out, crushed in on itself against the bulkhead. My hand was at my side next. It slipped free the fighting stick there. And my thumb flicked the button on its side.{&1310}\par The one man finished the slow climb to his feet. Teeth bared at me, he pulled his hand back and started squinting at me like the harder he squeezed his eyelids, the more powerful the coming blow. Both ends of the stick shot out two feet to either side, though. Another moment, and I brained him up one side of the head and down the other. Both eyes rolled up into his head after that.{&1310}\par I took one look at the man bleeding out on the floor. He was whimpering a string of muted obscenities into a blood-washed hand on his back, oblivious. He didn't notice me stagger then, and nearly topple. And I pulled it together again long enough to whip the butt of the staff into his skull. Then he was out too.{&1310}\par I guess I finally fell down after that. I barely noticed, staring at those two like I was. It was dark, but I could see the subtle rise and fall of their breathing chests. The one gurgled loudly on his broken nose. I managed to kick out a feeble foot and send him over onto his side. He stopped choking after that.{&1310}\par They weren't dead. Training took over, but they weren't dead. I slumped against the wall. My head felt lighter than air. And somehow I got numb fingers working enough to click the button on the staff again. It slide back into itself until it was only a foot-long stick in my hand once more. {&1310}\par Maybe Jonathon had given me one too many lessons. Or just enough. Sparring with him had always been more fun than reading hour after hour. But now, not so much. Sitting there staring dumly at those two broken bodies ... I think I would have traded all of it to be anywhere else just then.{&1310}\par The fighting stick had been a present from dad long ago after he found out about Jonathon's own lessons on the side with me. I tried to keep that hidden from him, and he almost killed the other man when he finally found out. No matter that Jonathon was twice dad's size and all muscle. For some reason, though. He didn't. He even found me that staff. I never thought I would use it. Not like that.{&1310}\par Jonathon never told me where he picked up all his tricks. He was as old as dad -  as anyone in Riftwatch. But not always. I had never hurt anyone like that before. It made me sick, just thinking about it. And I started to wonder, alone and shivering there in the dark with blood splattered all over my jacket ... if Jonathon ever had.{&1310}\par I might have been there a long time. Just sitting, and staring. It was hard to know for sure. But I found myself limping the rest of the way down the old maintenance tunnels toward the shuttlebays again some time later without knowing how I got there. I even had all my bags back with me again.{&1310}\par When I stumbled out into the bays, I was still in a daze. Numb, and unfeeling. People were suddenly all around me again, bright lights shining everywhere now as they shouted and worked. Loading and unloading cargo shuttles from off-station. Making my head hurt. {&1310}\par For the longest time, no one seemed to notice me. Then Dane Fitzpatrick did.{&1310}\par "Oh my god, Evelyn ... what happened to you?"{&1310}\par I came up short when the old bay manager caught me by both shoulders with his hands, jolting me out of that fugue. His eyes were wide and grave. I guess I must have really looked like shit.{&1310}\par "I'm okay, I just ..."{&1310}\par "Evelyn!"{&1310}\par He shook me again. I had started toward the floor without realizing it. There was too much empty space in there, and my head felt like it just couldn't fit it all. I tried to even out, easing myself down to the deck. But Fitzpatrick wasn't letting me.{&1310}\par "Hal! Kendrick!" he shouted at two men working a loader nearby. He waved them over impatiently with a heavy hand.{&1310}\par "Oh, what the hell, Dane," one yelled back at him. {&1310}\par The other, "What's up, boss?"{&1310}\par "Just get the hell over here!" Fitzpatrick snapped again.{&1310}\par And they gave me the same leery eye as the bay manager when they got close.{&1310}\par "What the hell happened to her?"{&1310}\par "Where's Thaddeus?" Fitzpatrick ignored him, forcing me to shrug out of each of my bags in turn. I managed to get down to my knees on the deck, but he wasn't letting me lie all the way down.{&1310}\par One of the two shrugged.{&1310}\par "Well, I saw him over near one of the transports. Go get him!"{&1310}\par He waved a hand that way.{&1310}\par "Hey. Hey!" I felt his hand slapping at my cheeks. Somehow, I was almost all the way down to the ground. He was holding my head up.{&1310}\par "Stay with me, kid."{&1310}\par Another old man swam into view beyond Fitzpatrick at some point. This one was dressed in a long, elegant red coat over his clothes, though. He dipped his craggly face and white beard in where I could see it.{&1310}\par "Found her just like this, Thaddeus," the bay manager's voice floated about the head of the old man. "Came wandering in without a word to anyone until we caught her."{&1310}\par That old man stared at me for a moment. Thaddeus. The Head Archivist of Riftwatch. The thought that he shouldn't have been down there came slowly, inching across my brain. I blinked back up at him. {&1310}\par Then someone else was at his side. He glanced that way.{&1310}\par "I think we've run out of time," he said, rasping out in his impossibly calm voice. "Wouldn't you agree?" {&1310}\par It felt like the whole world was spinning on its side. For some reason, it only bothered me, though.{&1310}\par That other someone was too busy looking at me. And I just got a glimpse of him before winking out completely.{&1310}\par "It's time to leave," he said. {&1310}\par Then I was gone.{&1310}\par }{&1310}

Been waiting way too long for something like this."{&1310}\par "I hear that."{&1310}\par Voices.{&1310}\par Someone was talking. Close. Footsteps, too. They got closer, squelching against moisture on the floor. Echoes and dark. Low laughter. The smell of ash, thick in the air.{&1310}\par "You want to get her up?"{&1310}\par "Why? You gonna take all the fun?"{&1310}\par "Just fucking do it, damn it."{&1310}\par "Whatever."{&1310}\par Two steps, really close. Right beside the ear. Shoes, and the reek of damp mold. Hands reaching down. They grabbed me by the arm, and my eyes snapped open.{&1310}\par That arm twisted back, free hand slipping fast into the man's face before he could blink. Crush the nose. Ankle around ankle, it took his leaning form right off his feet. He plunged face-first into the deck.{&1310}\par "Fffffukk!"{&1310}\par I rolled up and over his back. The other one was just a step away. Both legs swung around, hard, and caught him beneath the shins. He toppled with a sharp cry. I twisted away again, threw myself into the floor and pushed back up.{&1310}\par I had my feet, and they had the floor. One with a broken nose, the other scrambling to get back up. He snarled at me as he did. Peekay again. I leapt aside.{&1310}\par Air whistled past my ear. One of the lights behind winked out, crushed in on itself against the bulkhead. My hand was at my side next. It slipped free the fighting stick there. And my thumb flicked the button on its side.{&1310}\par The one man finished the slow climb to his feet. Teeth bared at me, he pulled his hand back and started squinting at me like the harder he squeezed his eyelids, the more powerful the coming blow. Both ends of the stick shot out two feet to either side, though. Another moment, and I brained him up one side of the head and down the other. Both eyes rolled up into his head after that.{&1310}\par I took one look at the man bleeding out on the floor. He was whimpering a string of muted obscenities into a blood-washed hand on his back, oblivious. He didn't notice me stagger then, and nearly topple. And I pulled it together again long enough to whip the butt of the staff into his skull. Then he was out too.{&1310}\par I guess I finally fell down after that. I barely noticed, staring at those two like I was. It was dark, but I could see the subtle rise and fall of their breathing chests. The one gurgled loudly on his broken nose. I managed to kick out a feeble foot and send him over onto his side. He stopped choking after that.{&1310}\par They weren't dead. Training took over, but they weren't dead. I slumped against the wall. My head felt lighter than air. And somehow I got numb fingers working enough to click the button on the staff again. It slide back into itself until it was only a foot-long stick in my hand once more. {&1310}\par Maybe Jonathon had given me one too many lessons. Or just enough. Sparring with him had always been more fun than reading hour after hour. But now, not so much. Sitting there staring dumly at those two broken bodies ... I think I would have traded all of it to be anywhere else just then.{&1310}\par The fighting stick had been a present from dad long ago after he found out about Jonathon's own lessons on the side with me. I tried to keep that hidden from him, and he almost killed the other man when he finally found out. No matter that Jonathon was twice dad's size and all muscle. For some reason, though. He didn't. He even found me that staff. I never thought I would use it. Not like that.{&1310}\par Jonathon never told me where he picked up all his tricks. He was as old as dad -  as anyone in Riftwatch. But not always. I had never hurt anyone like that before. It made me sick, just thinking about it. And I started to wonder, alone and shivering there in the dark with blood splattered all over my jacket ... if Jonathon ever had.{&1310}\par I might have been there a long time. Just sitting, and staring. It was hard to know for sure. But I found myself limping the rest of the way down the old maintenance tunnels toward the shuttlebays again some time later without knowing how I got there. I even had all my bags back with me again.{&1310}\par When I stumbled out into the bays, I was still in a daze. Numb, and unfeeling. People were suddenly all around me again, bright lights shining everywhere now as they shouted and worked. Loading and unloading cargo shuttles from off-station. Making my head hurt. {&1310}\par For the longest time, no one seemed to notice me. Then Dane Fitzpatrick did.{&1310}\par "Oh my god, Evelyn ... what happened to you?"{&1310}\par I came up short when the old bay manager caught me by both shoulders with his hands, jolting me out of that fugue. His eyes were wide and grave. I guess I must have really looked like shit.{&1310}\par "I'm okay, I just ..."{&1310}\par "Evelyn!"{&1310}\par He shook me again. I had started toward the floor without realizing it. There was too much empty space in there, and my head felt like it just couldn't fit it all. I tried to even out, easing myself down to the deck. But Fitzpatrick wasn't letting me.{&1310}\par "Hal! Kendrick!" he shouted at two men working a loader nearby. He waved them over impatiently with a heavy hand.{&1310}\par "Oh, what the hell, Dane," one yelled back at him. {&1310}\par The other, "What's up, boss?"{&1310}\par "Just get the hell over here!" Fitzpatrick snapped again.{&1310}\par And they gave me the same leery eye as the bay manager when they got close.{&1310}\par "What the hell happened to her?"{&1310}\par "Where's Thaddeus?" Fitzpatrick ignored him, forcing me to shrug out of each of my bags in turn. I managed to get down to my knees on the deck, but he wasn't letting me lie all the way down.{&1310}\par One of the two shrugged.{&1310}\par "Well, I saw him over near one of the transports. Go get him!"{&1310}\par He waved a hand that way.{&1310}\par "Hey. Hey!" I felt his hand slapping at my cheeks. Somehow, I was almost all the way down to the ground. He was holding my head up.{&1310}\par "Stay with me, kid."{&1310}\par Another old man swam into view beyond Fitzpatrick at some point. This one was dressed in a long, elegant red coat over his clothes, though. He dipped his craggly face and white beard in where I could see it.{&1310}\par "Found her just like this, Thaddeus," the bay manager's voice floated about the head of the old man. "Came wandering in without a word to anyone until we caught her."{&1310}\par That old man stared at me for a moment. Thaddeus. The Head Archivist of Riftwatch. The thought that he shouldn't have been down there came slowly, inching across my brain. I blinked back up at him. {&1310}\par Then someone else was at his side. He glanced that way.{&1310}\par "I think we've run out of time," he said, rasping out in his impossibly calm voice. "Wouldn't you agree?" {&1310}\par It felt like the whole world was spinning on its side. For some reason, it only bothered me, though.{&1310}\par That other someone was too busy looking at me.
