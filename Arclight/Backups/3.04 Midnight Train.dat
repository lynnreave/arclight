Not until a door came up fast in our path with everyone else who had escaped on the other side. A few of them hung near the small porthole in the door, wild and desperate faces peeking back through. Tess was pounding on it.{&1310}\par "Open up, god damnit!"{&1310}\par They shouted something back through that we couldn't hear. But it didn't matter.

It struck a chord in my brain.{&1310}\par Dad.{&1310}\par But Tess was pulling me away.{&1310}\par "Move it!"{&1310}\par We got to the end of the cabin, the deck narrowing down into a gangplank between that car and the next. It opened up into the tunnel outside. Tess only caught herself for a second before jumped across to the other side.{&1310}\par I looked back. The tattooed man fired at the thing slowly. Deliberately. It stalked down the aisles now in the dark, flickering lights from the tunnel casting its elongated shadow against bolts of fire. It shrugged them off or ignored them, and was on top of the man a second later.{&1310}\par One of those limbs stabbed in at him. He turned it aside with a sudden twist of his rifle - followed through, and struck the thing with the stock. A knife appeared in his hands and he stabbed it in the exposed side. One of those limbs came back around and knocked the rifle out of the tattooed man's hand. Another, and they sent him flying clear of his feet. He vanished in the dark.{&1310}\par I lost a few steps as that thing rounded on me and Tess, hulking in the flickering lights. The whispering started up anew with a ferver. Tess shouted at me through it, a hand on my arm. She hauled me back into the next car.{&1310}\par I dragged. We didn't stop moving all through that cabin and into the next. Not until a door came up fast in our path with everyone else who had escaped on the other side. A few of them hung near the small porthole in the door, wild and desperate faces peeking back through. Tess was pounding on it.{&1310}\par "Open up, god damnit!"{&1310}\par They shouted something back through that we couldn't hear. But it didn't matter. They didn't look like they were going to open it for us. Tess started screaming at the top of her lungs.{&1310}\par "LET US IN, YOU FUCKING ASSHOLES!"{&1310}\par I turned back around.{&1310}\par That thing was in the car behind. I watched it start down the aisles toward us. I slammed the door behind us shut.{&1310}\par The deck lurched. The tunnel veered right, and we were stuck outside in between cars. I hit the ground and wrapped my arms around the gangplank. Tess wasn't so lucky. She tumbled right off.{&1310}\par There was a ladder hanging to the side of the next cabin door. When I twisted back around to look, Tess was hanging off it. Looking wide-eyed and in shock. Her feet dangled down below.{&1310}\par "FUCK!"{&1310}\par I got back to my feet as soon as the deck settled. That thing was looming through the rear door porthole.{&1310}\par I fell back. The door exploded outward in the middle to the sound of rending metal. Something of that thing sliced through, slipping through a hole. It started peeling it back too.{&1310}\par "THIS WAY, EV!"{&1310}\par Tess had managed to pull herself up that ladder and was scrambling up toward the top of the next car. She flung one arm wildly at me. I leapt after her and vaulted up right behind.{&1310}\par That door came apart in pieces as I flopped over onto the cabin roof. The tunnel whipped by, closed air beating me down against the metal. What was left of the door flung out into it and burst into sparks as it vanished in a screeching mess behind.{&1310}\par For a few seconds, neither of us dared to move{&1310}\par Then the other door collapsed into a twisted, screaming heap.{&1310}\par I heard it. I didn't have to see it. And people started screaming again down below. I felt it through the metal when they died.{&1310}\par Tess had been holding her breath. It came rushing back out now, her voice shakingly wildly.{&1310}\par "C-Come on!"{&1310}\par She slipped around behind me - back towards the ladder we came up on. I looked ahead, but itwas hard to tell where the rest of the cars ended with the swerving tunnel and low lights. They might have gone on forever in the dark.{&1310}\par Tess peeked around the edge back toward the gangplank, holding her trembling breath. It rattled loudly in her chest as I shimmied up beside her. There was no sign of that thing when I looked down.{&1310}\par It took until those screams had died out in the dull roar of the tunnel rush before Tess started moving again, though.{&1310}\par She slipped over the edge and started hesitantly down the ladder. I followed. By the time she hit the ground, she was fretting over a glance into the car the thing had disappeared into. I joined her when she finally managed to do it.{&1310}\par Those torn up bodies all over the place were a familiar sight to me. Not Tess. She threw up off the gangplank and stumbled away. Nothing still moving in the car, though.{&1310}\par I chased Tess through the car behind back toward where we had started. The mess we had left behind didn't get any better. My head got heavy, and it was hard to feel my feet on the deck with the swell of coppery-fresh blood in the air. Tess hit the far door, catching herself before pitching out past the next gangplank. I staggered up beside her.{&1310}\par "I - I don't know what," she stammered, gasping with her mouth wide open like her lungs just wouldn't work, "what to do." {&1310}\par Her eyes flickered back at me. "What do we do, Ev?"{&1310}\par But I wasn't the one to give her an answer. I only had one. And itwas the same as hers.{&1310}\par Run.{&1310}\par Something popped up in front of her when she did, though.{&1310}\par Tess screamed, but that thing snatched her up. A gun slipped in to her hand. But it turned her whole arm aside. The bolt went wide.{&1310}\par I froze.{&1310}\par And that thing would have torn her apart. Would have. While I just stood there for the second longest moment of my life.{&1310}\par Except it was that tattooed man who had grabbed her before she could blow his head right off.{&1310}\par "Where is it?" he demanded in a low whisper when Tess eventually stopped struggling to kick or shoot his guts out. He let go of the hand he had clamped over her mouth too.{&1310}\par "B-back ..."{&1310}\par She started to point behind me, but couldn't finish. She just shook her head wildly.{&1310}\par "I don't know."{&1310}\par That tattooed man looked at the car behind. Then at her. Then at me.{&1310}\par Then he turned back around.{&1310}\par "Stay with me."\cf2 {&1310}\par }{&1310}

But I could still see it.{&1310}\par Service lights from outside a hole in the ceiling above flashed past. The cabin around was dark - overhead lights torn apart with the chunk out of the roof. It looked like the insides of a tunnel whipping past. The ground underneath was still moving and lurching fast.{&1310}\par In my mind's eye, that thing was hanging on top of the cabin outside. Sleek and black with too-smooth, colorless flesh and too-long limbs. Hunched against the metal frame like a parasite. It had cracked the shell with a razor-like maw, and peeled it right back.{&1310}\par Air rushed out. More rushed down and whipped up the length of the cabin. People tumbled over each other, screaming out in the dark. I didn't need to see them. I could hear them. Just like that thing whispering inside my head.{&1310}\par A gun went off.{&1310}\par Firebolts screamed through the air over everything else. They hit that thing perched atop the cabin, hissing into smooth, black flesh. The whispering in my head made a strange, off-key switch at that. Then the thing just dropped down right into the cabin and gave everyone a whole new thing to scream about.{&1310}\par "EV!"{&1310}\par Someone howled from that surge of stampeding bodies beside me. Tess was lost in there somewhere, crawling and clawing her way along the floor while people fell over and behind her. A few got through, but someone else shut them up then. A light flashed through the dark from ahead in the cabin.{&1310}\par "Move!"{&1310}\par A man was shouting at those people still in the way and blocking that light. Some of them ducked aside. Most of them kept going. Bolts of fire started coming regardless, punching holes through the dark toward the back of the cabin.{&1310}\par For a long time, I just watched that thing tear anyone unlucky enough to still be at the back of the car apart.{&1310}\par Then someone was clawing at my ankle.{&1310}\par "COME ON, EV!" Tess shrieked up at me. "SNAP OUT OF IT!"{&1310}\par She dragged me away again. Someone hit her from the side, and a stray bolt of fire lit up the man's shoulder. Tess ducked, and scrambled on knees, feet, and free hand ahead into the cabin with that stampede of people.{&1310}\par They were almost all gone now - vanished in a flurry of desperate screaming into the next car ahead.
