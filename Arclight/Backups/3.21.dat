I hadn't expect to, so that was the first thing that surprised me. The next was that I was lying on on top of something hard that had bruised all the bones and muscles down my back. And someone was holding me down.{&1310}\par "Evelyn, wake up."{&1310}\par There was shaking and slapping on my face. The pain in my side aching back to life like it had been just waiting for me to regain consciousness. Cold air and damp clothes. I gasped, blinking every which way at once.{&1310}\par Eventually, I fixed on that man standing over me.{&1310}\par "They got a hold of you, didn't they?" he demanded. "Theresa? The security guard?"{&1310}\par I blinked at him again, things coming back into focus. And I realized who it was that was standing there, holding me down and slapping me in the face.{&1310}\par "Julian?"{&1310}\par "Did the Dreggoran turn you in?" he spoke right over me.{&1310}\par "What-" I looked down toward that hole in my side. "What did you do to me?"{&1310}\par It hurt like hell where that police officer had shot me through and my blood-encrusted hands hovered, trembling, over the spot. I was afraid to touch it.{&1310}\par "I'm out of stimulants thanks to you," he said, "so you're lucky to be alive at all. Now, look at me." He grabbed me by both my arms and got in my face. "Did he turn you two in?"{&1310}\par "What? Who?"{&1310}\par "That kid we picked up leaving Shtess," he explained impatiently. "Did he give you up, or did they track you all down?"{&1310}\par "He, uh," I shook my head, still spinning and overwhelmed with that hole burning in me. "I don't know. I don't think so."{&1310}\par "They probably know what we look like then. Or will soon."{&1310}\par "Is that how they found us ...?" I frowned, blinking around. "No, wait - they came looking for Richter!"{&1310}\par My face was wet. I was sweating beneath the rain that had soaked my hair and skin. I felt light-headed and weak and it was hard to grasp coherent thoughts inside my head. If I hadn't been lying down, I might have collapsed over again.{&1310}\par "Then I might have some time," he said, thinking. He glanced at me again, lying on what I realized was a table, and corrected himself. "\i We\i0  might have some time."{&1310}\par "For what?"{&1310}\par He didn't answer me, though. Not right away. He stared off for a second or two before looking down at my wound and the rest of me. We were in some kind of old, abandoned room. The furniture was dusty, unkempt, and mostly broken. It looked like he'd been surviving down there on whatever rations he'd had left from his own supplies. Somehow, he'd bathed, but not very well. It made me think of a rat.{&1310}\par "Listen to me, Evelyn." He got close and severe once more. "The whole city is going into lockdown over those police murders back at the building where I found you."{&1310}\par "Lockdown?" I breathed. It didn't click for a second, but I figured out he meant the ones that I had killed in Richter's apartment.{&1310}\par He nodded. "And I won't be getting out of here once it does, so I'm going now."{&1310}\par "Now?" I demanded incredulously. "What about us? What about Tess?"{&1310}\par "Can't help her now." He shook his head. "And if you ever want to get off this moon, you'll have to come with me. Now."{&1310}\par The thought of leaving Tess behind was the only thing in my head from all that. I grabbed at his arm and started pleading.{&1310}\par "No, you have to help me get her back," I begged, tugging him down. "You can't just leave her here ..."{&1310}\par "Did you hear what I just said?" he growled, taking my hand and removed it from his arm. "There's nothing we can do for her now."{&1310}\par "Please, I can't ... I can't just leave her!" I grabbed at him again.{&1310}\par "Evelyn, it doesn't matter, she's-"{&1310}\par He stopped, and pushed my hands away. Those flint-like eyes were heavy on me for a few moments before he finally sighed.{&1310}\par "I don't have time for this."{&1310}\par I just shook my head helplessly at him. "She told me you could help ..." I didn't know what else to say.{&1310}\par "She was wrong. Come with me now, or don't," he warned me. "But you won't get off this moon without me if you don't leave now. They will lock it down and find you just like they did before."{&1310}\par I stared at him. I did it for a long time. Because I felt my world shattering around me with that single thought in my head. Leaving Tess behind. She'd told me to get help. She'd \i told\i0  me ... She was counting on me to help her, and she had nobody else. I wondered if she realized back then how quickly he would give her up and leave her behind. I think it all made sense to me. I could see the signs, but I still wouldn't have believed.{&1310}\par I stared at him for so long without saying anything that he started to turn away. That was what did it. That was what finally broke me inside.{&1310}\par "Wait!"{&1310}\par He stopped, and looked back.{&1310}\par "Don't ... don't leave me here," I begged. I suddenly wasn't above that at the sight of him walking out of there for good and leaving me behind like so much trash. And I \i hated\i0  myself for it.{&1310}\par "Please don't," I whispered.{&1310}\par And he didn't.\cf2\f2 {&1310}\par }{&1310}
