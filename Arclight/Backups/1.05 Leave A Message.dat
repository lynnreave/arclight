Kind of ... \i weird\i0  ... leaving a message likes this. I mean, how do I even know if you'll get this? They're gonna screen it right? So what if I say something they don't want you to hear or think will distract you from whatever their screaming in your face everyday or -- I don't know. I \i really\i0  wish this was a live feed. Who the hell leaves messages anymore, anyways? Unless, I guess, you aren't around or something, and I have to get the machine ...{&1310}\par "... anyways ... I just got done for the day at Bertram's and wanted to try this out -- not used to leaving messages that some crew-cut military guy might listen to, you know? Probably an asshole too ... Shit. I wonder if they'll flag me for calling some navy asshole an asshole ... Whatever. Just make sure you send me a message back, okay? That's the only way I'll know if this works or not and I should do it again. I mean, \i of course\i0  I \i should\i0  do it, but ... I feel like I'm talking to myself here. Crazy. Good thing no one's around to see me talking to myself. Except that asshole who's gonna screen this whole thing, I guess ... And you, Ev ..."{&1310}\par "You're gonna drive me crazy with that shit, Weir."{&1310}\par I jerked back to myself at the sound of Komi's voice. I'd forgotten about her. Was she even there when I sat down? I don't know. I couldn't remember.{&1310}\par Tess' voice just continued on uninterrupted from the holographic image in front of me, not paying any attention to me or Komi. It rendered her in excruciatingly life-like detail -- so much so that I could almost forget it was just a recording. And over four months old, too. If I didn't think about it too much, I could almost imagine I was talking to her right \i now\i0 .{&1310}\par "... been about a week doing that. It really wasn't as much fun without you around. All they care about is finding some new way to split Shenlezite or re-inventing spaceship hulls or ... well, there was that one time I found out that guy your dad never liked -- you know, the guy Bertram had to throw out because he kept throwing up all over the floor that one night, screaming at us? Anyways, ... apparently he was working on some \i super\i0  secret project for a new weapon for a vice admiral or something and ..."{&1310}\par Komi groaned aloud and tried to stuff a pillow over her face where she was lying on her rack. "You've been going at it for over an hour!" She laid like that, covering her face and ears. I didn't look at her.{&1310}\par "Sorry," I said distractedly, but I didn't turn the recording off. I just switched to another one from about three-and-a-half months ago instead.{&1310}\par "... gonna start opening these messages with some really perverted shit. Just to see if that guy screening them notices." Tess laughed in the imager, shaking her loose, pinkish hair from side to side. "They'd probably block me for sure then. And where would you be, Ev? I'm probably the most important person you're gonna talk to while you're there. Speaking of which -- meet any admirals yet? Yeah, that lieutenant guy you're always talking about sounds like an asshole, but ... hey, I wonder if he's the one who's looking these over ... I guess you probably want to hear about what your dad has been up to." She sidestepped into another conversation entirely again with a groan, rolling her eyes at me. "Fine, but only because I \i know\i0  he's probably not leaving you as much messages as me ..."{&1310}\par I got a twinge and a sinking sort of feeling in my chest like too much blood was sitting there. Dad had never left me any messages. In six months, not one. But he had always been busy, and that made sense. Time froze for me here on the \i Soyorov\i0  -- from the moment I stepped foot inside the academy, but the rest of the system had gone on without me outside. So had dad. Home. You couldn't tell from the way she talked to the holorecorder, but I was a ghost even to Tess. Every response was in delay and she'd probably already forgotten what it was like to be in the same room as me. Or even the same station. I could almost imagine that they had all just forgotten about me and I'd suddenly appear one day and someone might say, "who the hell is this girl who just shows up on a navy shuttle like she belongs here?" I wondered if that would make it any easier. Probably not.{&1310}\par "... do you remember that guy I told you about? The one who was working on the secret project for a captain? Or was it an admiral? ... Anyways, he was drinking at Bertram's one night last week and hella chatting me up when he got drunk -- bragging about it and \i everything\i0 . Trying to impress me and get me to talk to him, you know? Like he wasn't old and kind of gross-looking. Something about 'supercoliding new particles' and super secret shit like that. You wonder how he doesn't get transfered off-station or fired or something ..."{&1310}\par "I give up."{&1310}\par Komi kicked her legs out and sat up, squeezing the heels of her hands into her eyes. I don't think she'd slept much last night. More than usual, anyways. No one slept much -- ever. They wouldn't let you.{&1310}\par I felt kind of bad, though, blinking back to reality and realizing she couldn't get any rest with me playing old messages out loud like that. I looked at her apologetically.{&1310}\par "I'll turn it off," I promised. "I'm done. You can get some sleep."{&1310}\par "It'd be nice," she grumbled, seemed to think better of it, rolled her eyes, and sighed. "She's your best friend ... and you haven't seen her in half a year. I know how that is."{&1310}\par Komi had a big family back home in one of the smaller cities on Haiwayee, with a younger bother and sister who were twins and she was very close to. I was probably the only one in this place who knew just how much she missed them everyday. They left her messages all the time. Silly, happy little things that you'd expect kids to make. I got to see a few -- it wasn't like we got much privacy from each other -- and those two were so bright and sweet and full of life that it made my heart wrench. With a family like that back home, I wondered sometimes why Komi was even here. They were beautiful.{&1310}\par I had Tess, and dad. And I guess Bertram too. Not much else back home on Riftwatch station where the brightest minds of the Dreggoran navies gathered to discover the next great thing to help the Grand Admirals win their war against piracy or gain an edge against the other planetary systems. It was easy to walk away from, especially when I'd had them for so long already and dad wanted me to. At least, that's what I'd thought six months ago. I'd told Tess to keep in touch, but ... I never would have realized just how much I would miss her out here. She was the closest thing I'd had to something like what Komi had. And it hurt to feel abandoned and left behind like this.{&1310}\par "You'll get to see them next week," Komi was saying. "You should be really excited."{&1310}\par My face must have registered some of what I was thinking. That, and I'd been playing these old messages a lot of late. I wasn't excited, though, I don't think. Scared, maybe. Anxious. It felt weird to imagine going home after all this time. I told her as much.{&1310}\par "I know. Six months is a long time away from everyone. It'll be even longer when we come back, you know."{&1310}\par "\i If\i0  we come back," I said, and I couldn't help it sounding bitter. I had my doubts. I had a lot of them.{&1310}\par "You shouldn't think about it like that."{&1310}\par "Why not?" {&1310}\par I sighed, but it was just rhetorical since I was still only half paying attention to her. I had said I was done and I was turning it off, but I'd lied. My fingers scrubbed idly across the holographic controls, swiping through message files on the screen. I don't know why I bothered sometimes. Tess' face jerked around in stopped motion between start frames in each recording, making her look like some kind of weird martinet cycling through different facial expressions frozen in time until I hit 'play'. "It's not like I really belong here anyways," I mumbled under my breath.{&1310}\par I was in a funk, and feeling pretty miserable with myself. Maybe it had something to do with how close we had come to the end. All this time and effort and trying and ... I was as sure as I could be without the final word that I wasn't going to graduate. I kept thinking about all the mistakes I'd made along the way -- some of them so stupid in the moment that I wondered how I could have even let it happen, the memory was burned so embarassingly into my head forever -- and I wished I could just jump back in time and make it so they never happened. Sometimes I felt like I should never have come here. I didn't want to start over, but I didn't want to live with what I had already done either. It would be better if I just stayed home when I got back there and never even came back for finals at all.{&1310}\par What were they going to do? Declare me AWOL? It's not like they wanted me anyways.{&1310}\par "What do you mean?" Komi asked. Her flat tone told me that she already knew the answer but her mouth had gotten ahead of her head. We'd been shacked up for months together, but Komi had gotten ahead where I had fallen behind. Anywhere else and we would have been best friends or worst enemies by now. We kind of had been -- for a while, at least. Before it had started becoming obvious I wasn't cut out for this and wasn't making progress over my mistakes like most of the others were. Now there was just this growing rift of indifference for the weaker cadet, like cutting ties or sloughing of gangrene. Me. I was Komi's gangrenous limb. The platoon's. The academy's.{&1310}\par And, somehow, that made everything feel so much worse.{&1310}\par Again, I sighed.{&1310}\par "I don't know," I lied. "I can't \i do\i0  anything. My PK scores suck -- they don't even exist. PT is mediocre, maybe not even good enough for a regular recruit and-"{&1310}\par "You did great in front of Lieutenant Morisant yesterday, though."{&1310}\par "But that doesn't even ..."{&1310}\par I groaned heavily, irritably. And looked at her.{&1310}\par "You don't get it, Komi. \i You're\i0  going to make it. I'm not. I don't even have a chance." I was shaking my head. "Do you have any idea how that feels? \i No\i0 , you don't," I answered for her. "And nothing you say is going to change anything or make it better."{&1310}\par She stared back with her brown eyes out of her brown face at me. She looked military-crisp and also feminine and confident in herself at the same time in that subtle way the women in uniform I'd seen had. I looked at her and I could already see the officer. The powerful psychokinetic soldier. Her career mapped out in front of her like it'd been etched in lines of fate a long time ago and couldn't have been any different. And what did I see when I looked at myself in the mirror every morning before lights? Nothing. I was blank. I had no future here. I saw that and I was so sure that that was what everyone else saw too that it took me aback for a second the way she touched my arm and spoke to me next.{&1310}\par "Weir," she started. "Evelyn." And she took a collective breath, fixing me with her dark, immaculate eyes. "One, that's not fair. You're comparing yourself to me and that's not fair. It doesn't matter. You get accepted or rejected on your own merits and no one is going to know or care what happened here once you get out and into the fleets. No one - not you, not the other officers, not Lieutenant Morisant. Not your father. No one.{&1310}\par "Two -- you keep beating yourself up like this and you \i will\i0  fail. You will. Finals will come and you will choke because you put so much pressure on doing everything exactly right that you can't let yourself breathe. Or think straight. You're just scared. But ... we all are. I am most of the time. You really aren't doing as badly as you think. I know. I've been here the whole time.{&1310}\par "Three."{&1310}\par She stopped, and if it were possible for that look to get any heavier or more forcefully intent on making sure I understood exactly what she was saying without a single doubt, it did. She squeezed her fingers tight into my arm and made me listen.{&1310}\par "You are going to make it. \i Believe\i0  it. Believe it. Go home and get your head straight. Practice every day until you can clear your mind and you'll find you have it in you. It's genetic. You just need the right atmosphere to open up in. You're father is very powerful. You have something there buried deep down inside you, no matter how small. And you're going to show them that when the time comes. I know you will."{&1310}\par "Okay."{&1310}\par "Yeah? Okay?"{&1310}\par It was hard to escape her and look away, but I did. I was a warring bundle of emotions that couldn't figure out if it was anger, bitterness, frustration, depression, or, maybe, hope that wanted to come out on top. They moved too quickly for me to decide, but there were tears burning in the corners of my eyes. I swiped at them in exaggerated motions with a hand to do something -- anything -- and sniffed.{&1310}\par "Okay."{&1310}\par Komi tried to hug me, and I relented. I don't know if I'd changed my mind yet. I felt too out-of-sorts with myself.{&1310}\par The door chimed, and opened.{&1310}\par "Woah, sorry to break up the love-fest, girls, but-"{&1310}\par "Get the fuck out of here, Hammar," Komi spat almost immediatley with a flash of anger that was startling next to how softly she'd been talking to me just a second before. "What the hell makes you think you can just bust in here like that?"{&1310}\par "Woooaaah," the bigger cadet stuck up a hand. "Door wasn't locked okay?" I pushed back from Komi and quickly looked away while I scrubbed at my eyes. I couldn't help sniffing some more. Komi stood.{&1310}\par "You crying in here?" Hammar frowned and asked, staring past her at me. I put my hands over my face to block him out.{&1310}\par \i God. Fuck. Just stop looking at me.{&1310}\par \i0 "What the hell do you want, Hammar?" Komi was in front of him at the door, blocking most of his view of me. I realized without having noticed it before that someone was standing behind him. Miller. Of course.{&1310}\par "Calm down, Kominshk," Hammar was laughing her anger at him off like it didn't faze him. It probably didn't. When had it ever? "Just wanted to stop by and ask if you had any chance to think about coming out when we get back planetside again --"{&1310}\par "No."{&1310}\par "-- my dad'll be home on leave and he's got this fucking sweet yacht we could go cruising around in for a week or however long we want and --"{&1310}\par "No. No fucking way."{&1310}\par "-- he's already said we can do whatever we want and-- what the fuck! Come on, Kominshk! It'll be -- It'll be \i great\i0 ."{&1310}\par "Why the \i hell \i0 would I even want to do that? With you? I already blew you off once, Hammar. Did you think I didn't mean it or something? Christ!"{&1310}\par "Oh, come on! Just give me a chance, I mean -- we can go out to the Rift and pick up your friend--" he gestured over her shoulder at me "--Mills can come, and he thinks she's kind of cute. Right? Tell her, Mills."{&1310}\par "Well, uh--"{&1310}\par "Yeah, like a double date or something. You know?"{&1310}\par Apparently she didn't know, though, because Komi's only response to that was to abruptly shove the other cadet back out of the way so she could shut the door right in their faces. It whirred closed and I heard Hammar swearing just outside in surprise. Komi stood there, still and staring at it with her fists balled at her sides, for about a minute before she finally turned back around{&1310}\par "Sorry," she apologized. She slumped back against the door, blowing her cheeks out as she sighed. I was mostly re-composed. My eyes were probably a little red, but clear.{&1310}\par "For what?"{&1310}\par She shook her head, barking a laugh at herself while her eyes blinked closed.{&1310}\par "I don't -- I don't even know." {&1310}\par A few seconds more and another sigh that turned into a half sort of bitter laugh. {&1310}\par "Can you believe him?"{&1310}\par I shrugged, not really too worried about it compared to so many other things. {&1310}\par "If it were anyone else, I ... I don't know."{&1310}\par "You mean you \i don't\i0  like 'The Hammer'"?{&1310}\par "Seriously," she laughed it off, "fuck him. \i Seriously\i0 ."{&1310}\par "You're the one he wants," I teased, "not me."{&1310}\par She blinked, and the joke almost got past her. I was the only one who got to see her break down her composure and show some reaction to all the shit that happened outside our bunkroom. She was so careful out there.{&1310}\par "Yeah, well ... sounds like Mills has a thing for \i you\i0  too."{&1310}\par "Probably just hopes to get to you by kissing up to me. Everyone here thinks you're the best."{&1310}\par We were both laughing now. It was nice too, and I did start to feel better.{&1310}\par "You really are the best," I repeated. "You know that?"{&1310}\par Komi's face lit up at that. I didn't expect her to take a compliment from me -- the worst-performing cadet on the whole ship -- as worth much. But the way she smiled and started to blush, you'd think I was Lieutenant Morisant telling her that. Which was weird. Because she opened her mouth to say something and the comm for the room cut her off short.{&1310}\par "Cadet Weir."{&1310}\par Speak of the devil.{&1310}\par Lieutenant Morisant's voice barged in -- cold, calm, and insistent. Somehow I'd summoned him and his attention just by thinking about it. It wasn't even that bad of a joke, really. They said natural psychokinetics with enough power could read people's thoughts as plain as day, and they had a sixth sense about things. Not that I'd met any of them. Even dad never talked about it, so who knew.{&1310}\par But it was then that I realized just who he had called for. And that he had called specifically to our bunkroom. In almost six months -- that had never happened to a cadet. Not once. At least, that I knew of.{&1310}\par So, I froze there on the spot like I'd just been called out to get my ass chewed in front of the whole unit. Like I did far, far too often.{&1310}\par "Cadet Kominshk," the lieutenant continued in a slightly different tone that must have been his version of irritated.{&1310}\par "Aye, sir?"{&1310}\par "Is Cadet Weir asleep?"{&1310}\par "Uh, no, sir, she's-"{&1310}\par "I'm h-here, sir," I cut her off again as quickly as I could. I couldn't keep that tremble out of my voice as I did it, though. God damnit. {&1310}\par Every time.{&1310}\par "Then report to Commander Delacroix's office, cadet. Immediately."{&1310}\par And the comm went dead before either of us could think to say anything more.\cf2\f2 {&1310}\par }{&1310}

It's not like they wanted me anyways.{&1310}\par "What do you mean?" Komi asked. Her flat tone told me that she already knew the answer but her mouth had gotten ahead of her head. We'd been shacked up for months together, but Komi had gotten ahead where I had fallen behind. Anywhere else and we would have been best friends or worst enemies by now. We kind of had been -- for a while, at least. Before it had started becoming obvious I wasn't cut out for this and wasn't making progress over my mistakes like most of the others were. Now there was just this growing rift of indifference for the weaker cadet, like cutting ties or sloughing of gangrene. Me. I was Komi's gangrenous limb. The platoon's. The academy's.{&1310}\par And, somehow, that made everything feel so much worse.{&1310}\par Again, I sighed.{&1310}\par "I don't know," I lied. "I can't \i do\i0  anything. My PK scores suck -- they don't even exist. PT is mediocre, maybe not even good enough for a regular recruit and-"{&1310}\par "You did great in front of Lieutenant Morisant yesterday, though."{&1310}\par "But that doesn't even ..."{&1310}\par I groaned heavily, irritably. And looked at her.{&1310}\par "You don't get it, Komi. \i You're\i0  going to make it. I'm not. I don't even have a chance." I was shaking my head. "Do you have any idea how that feels? \i No\i0 , you don't," I answered for her. "And nothing you say is going to change anything or make it better."{&1310}\par She stared back with her brown eyes out of her brown face at me. She looked military-crisp and also feminine and confident in herself at the same time in that subtle way the women in uniform I'd seen had. I looked at her and I could already see the officer. The powerful psychokinetic soldier. Her career mapped out in front of her like it'd been etched in lines of fate a long time ago and couldn't have been any different. And what did I see when I looked at myself in the mirror every morning before lights? Nothing. I was blank. I had no future here. I saw that and I was so sure that that was what everyone else saw too that it took me aback for a second the way she touched my arm and spoke to me next.{&1310}\par "Weir," she started. "Evelyn." And she took a collective breath, fixing me with her dark, immaculate eyes. "One, that's not fair. You're comparing yourself to me and that's not fair. It doesn't matter. You get accepted or rejected on your own merits and no one is going to know or care what happened here once you get out and into the fleets. No one - not you, not the other officers, not Lieutenant Morisant. Not your father. No one.{&1310}\par "Two -- you keep beating yourself up like this and you \i will\i0  fail. You will. Finals will come and you will choke because you put so much pressure on doing everything exactly right that you can't let yourself breathe. Or think straight. You're just scared. But ... we all are. I am most of the time. You really aren't doing as badly as you think. I know. I've been here the whole time.{&1310}\par "Three."{&1310}\par She stopped, and if it were possible for that look to get any heavier or more forcefully intent on making sure I understood exactly what she was saying without a single doubt, it did. She squeezed her fingers tight into my arm and made me listen.{&1310}\par "You are going to make it. \i Believe\i0  it. Believe it. Go home and get your head straight. Practice every day until you can clear your mind and you'll find you have it in you. It's genetic. You just need the right atmosphere to open up in. You're father is very powerful. You have something there buried deep down inside you, no matter how small. And you're going to show them that when the time comes. I know you will."{&1310}\par "Okay."{&1310}\par "Yeah? Okay?"{&1310}\par It was hard to escape her and look away, but I did. I was a warring bundle of emotions that couldn't figure out if it was anger, bitterness, frustration, depression, or, maybe, hope that wanted to come out on top. They moved too quickly for me to decide, but there were tears burning in the corners of my eyes. I swiped at them in exaggerated motions with a hand to do something -- anything -- and sniffed.{&1310}\par "Okay."{&1310}\par Komi tried to hug me, and I relented. I don't know if I'd changed my mind yet. I felt too out-of-sorts with myself.{&1310}\par The door chimed, and opened.{&1310}\par "Woah, sorry to break up the love-fest, girls, but-"{&1310}\par "Get the fuck out of here, Hammar," Komi spat almost immediatley with a flash of anger that was startling next to how softly she'd been talking to me just a second before. "What the hell makes you think you can just bust in here like that?"{&1310}\par "Woooaaah," the bigger cadet stuck up a hand. "Door wasn't locked okay?" I pushed back from Komi and quickly looked away while I scrubbed at my eyes. I couldn't help sniffing some more. Komi stood.{&1310}\par "You crying in here?" Hammar frowned and asked, staring past her at me. I put my hands over my face to block him out.{&1310}\par \i God. Fuck. Just stop looking at me.{&1310}\par \i0 "What the hell do you want, Hammar?" Komi was in front of him at the door, blocking most of his view of me. I realized without having noticed it before that someone was standing behind him. Miller. Of course.{&1310}\par "Calm down, Kominshk," Hammar was laughing her anger at him off like it didn't faze him. It probably didn't. When had it ever? "Just wanted to stop by and ask if you had any chance to think about coming out when we get back planetside again --"{&1310}\par "No."{&1310}\par "-- my dad'll be home on leave and he's got this fucking sweet yacht we could go cruising around in for a week or however long we want and --"{&1310}\par "No. No fucking way."{&1310}\par "-- he's already said we can do whatever we want and-- what the fuck! Come on, Kominshk! It'll be -- It'll be \i great\i0 ."{&1310}\par "Why the \i hell \i0 would I even want to do that? With you? I already blew you off once, Hammar. Did you think I didn't mean it or something? Christ!"{&1310}\par "Oh, come on! Just give me a chance, I mean -- we can go out to the Rift and pick up your friend--" he gestured over her shoulder at me "--Mills can come, and he thinks she's kind of cute. Right? Tell her, Mills."{&1310}\par "Well, uh--"{&1310}\par "Yeah, like a double date or something. You know?"{&1310}\par Apparently she didn't know, though, because Komi's only response to that was to abruptly shove the other cadet back out of the way so she could shut the door right in their faces. It whirred closed and I heard Hammar swearing just outside in surprise. Komi stood there, still and staring at it with her fists balled at her sides, for about a minute before she finally turned back around{&1310}\par "Sorry," she apologized. She slumped back against the door, blowing her cheeks out as she sighed. I was mostly re-composed. My eyes were probably a little red, but clear.{&1310}\par "For what?"{&1310}\par She shook her head, barking a laugh at herself while her eyes blinked closed.{&1310}\par "I don't -- I don't even know." {&1310}\par A few seconds more and another sigh that turned into a half sort of bitter laugh. {&1310}\par "Can you believe him?"{&1310}\par I shrugged, not really too worried about it compared to so many other things. {&1310}\par "If it were anyone else, I ... I don't know."{&1310}\par "You mean you \i don't\i0  like 'The Hammer'"?{&1310}\par "Seriously," she laughed it off, "fuck him. \i Seriously\i0 ."{&1310}\par "You're the one he wants," I teased, "not me."{&1310}\par She blinked, and the joke almost got past her. I was the only one who got to see her break down her composure and show some reaction to all the shit that happened outside our bunkroom. She was so careful out there.{&1310}\par "Yeah, well ... sounds like Mills has a thing for \i you\i0  too."{&1310}\par "Probably just hopes to get to you by kissing up to me. Everyone here thinks you're the best."{&1310}\par We were both laughing now. It was nice too, and I did start to feel better.{&1310}\par "You really are the best," I repeated. "You know that?"{&1310}\par Komi's face lit up at that. I didn't expect her to take a compliment from me -- the worst-performing cadet on the whole ship -- as worth much. But the way she smiled and started to blush, you'd think I was Lieutenant Morisant telling her that. Which was weird. Because she opened her mouth to say something and the comm for the room cut her off short.{&1310}\par "Cadet Weir."{&1310}\par Speak of the devil.{&1310}\par Lieutenant Morisant's voice barged in -- cold, calm, and insistent. Somehow I'd summoned him and his attention just by thinking about it. It wasn't even that bad of a joke, really. They said natural psychokinetics with enough power could read people's thoughts as plain as day, and they had a sixth sense about things. Not that I'd met any of them. Even dad never talked about it, so who knew.{&1310}\par But it was then that I realized just who he had called for. And that he had called specifically to our bunkroom. In almost six months -- that had never happened to a cadet. Not once. At least, that I knew of.{&1310}\par So, I froze there on the spot like I'd just been called out to get my ass chewed in front of the whole unit. Like I did far, far too often.{&1310}\par "Cadet Kominshk," the lieutenant continued in a slightly different tone that must have been his version of irritated.{&1310}\par "Aye, sir?"{&1310}\par "Is Cadet Weir asleep?"{&1310}\par "Uh, no, sir, she's-"{&1310}\par "I'm h-here, sir," I cut her off again as quickly as I could. I couldn't keep that tremble out of my voice as I did it, though. God damnit. {&1310}\par Every time.{&1310}\par "Then report to Commander Delacroix's office, cadet. Immediately."{&1310}\par And the comm went dead before either of us could think to say anything more.\cf2\f2 {&1310}\par }{&1310}

They wouldn't let you.{&1310}\par I felt kind of bad, though, blinking back to reality and realizing she couldn't get any rest with me playing old messages out loud like that. I looked at her apologetically.{&1310}\par "I'll turn it off," I promised. "I'm done. You can get some sleep."{&1310}\par "It'd be nice," she mumbled, a little irritably. Then she sighed. "She's your best friend, and you haven't seen her in half a year. I know how that is."{&1310}\par Komi had a big family back home in one of the smaller cities on Haiwayee, with a younger bother and sister who were twins and she was very close to. As far as I knew, I was the only one who knew just how much she missed them everyday. They left her messages all the time. Silly, happy little things that you'd expect kids to make. I got to see a few -- it wasn't like we got much privacy from each other -- and those two were so bright and sweet and full of life that it made my heart wrench. With a family like that back home, I wondered sometimes why Komi was even here. They were beautiful.{&1310}\par I had Tess, and dad. And I guess Bertram too. Not much else back home on Riftwatch station where the brightest minds of the Dreggoran navies gathered to discover the next great thing to help the Grand Admirals win their war against piracy in the sector. It was easy to walk away from, especially when I'd had them for so long already and dad wanted me to. At least, that's what I'd thought six months ago. I'd told Tess to keep in touch, but ... I never would have realized just how much I would miss her out here. She was the closest thing I had to something like what Komi had.{&1310}\par "You'll get to see them next week," Komi was saying. "You should be really excited."{&1310}\par My face must have registered some of what I was thinking. That, and I'd been playing these old messages a lot of late. I wasn't excited, though, I don't think. Scared, maybe. Anxious. It felt weird to imagine going home after all this time. I told her as much.{&1310}\par "I know. Six months is a long time away from everyone. It'll be even longer when we come back, you know."{&1310}\par "\i If\i0  we come back," I said, and I couldn't help it sounding bitter. I had my doubts, at least about myself. I had a lot of them and nothing to give me much hope.\cf2\f2 {&1310}\par }{&1310}

I don't think she'd slept much last night. More than usual, anyways. No one slept much -- ever. They wouldn't let you.{&1310}\par I felt kind of bad, though, blinking back to reality and realizing she couldn't get any rest with me playing old messages out loud like that. I looked at her apologetically.{&1310}\par "I'll turn it off," I promised. "I'm done. You can get some sleep."{&1310}\par "It'd be nice," she mumbled, a little irritably. Then she sighed. "She's your best friend, and you haven't seen her in half a year. I know how that is."{&1310}\par Komi had a big family back home in one of the smaller cities on Haiwayee, with a younger bother and sister who were twins and she was very close to. As far as I knew, I was the only one who knew just how much she missed them everyday. They left her messages all the time. Silly, happy little things that you'd expect kids to make. I got to see a few -- it wasn't like we got much privacy from each other -- and those two were so bright and sweet and full of life that it made my heart wrench. With a family like that back home, I wondered sometimes why Komi was even here. They were beautiful.{&1310}\par I had Tess, and dad. And I guess Bertram too. Not much else back home on Riftwatch station where the brightest minds of the Dreggoran navies gathered to discover the next great thing to help the Grand Admirals win their war against piracy in the sector. It was easy to walk away from, especially when I'd had them for so long already and dad wanted me to. At least, that's what I'd thought six months ago. I'd told Tess to keep in touch, but ... I never would have realized just how much I would miss her out here. She was the closest thing I had to something like what Komi had.{&1310}\par "You'll get to see them next week," Komi was saying. "You should be really excited."{&1310}\par My face must have registered some of what I was thinking. That, and I'd been playing these old messages a lot of late. I wasn't excited, though, I don't think. Scared, maybe. Anxious. It felt weird to imagine going home after all this time. I told her as much.{&1310}\par "I know. Six months is a long time away from everyone. It'll be even longer when we come back, you know."{&1310}\par "\i If\i0  we come back," I said, and I couldn't help it sounding bitter. I had my doubts, at least about myself. I had a lot of them and nothing to give me much hope.\cf2\f2 {&1310}\par }{&1310}

Kind of ... \i weird\i0  ... leaving a message likes this. I mean, how do I even know if you'll get this? They're gonna screen it right? So what if I say something they don't want you to hear or think will distract you from whatever dumb thing their screaming into your face or -- I don't know. I \i really\i0  wish this was a live feed. Who the hell leaves messages anymore, anyways? Unless, I guess, you aren't around or something, and I have to get the machine ...{&1310}\par "... anyways ... I just got done for the day at Bertram's and wanted to try this out -- not used to leaving messages that some crew-cut military guy might listen to, you know? Probably an asshole too ... Shit. I wonder if they'll flag me for calling some navy asshole an asshole ... Whatever. Just make sure you send me a message back, okay? That's the only way I'll know if this works or not and I should do it again. I mean, \i of course\i0  I \i should\i0  do it, but ... I feel like I'm talking to myself here. Crazy. Good thing no one's around to see me talking to myself. Except that asshole who's gonna screen this whole thing, I guess ... And you, Ev ..."{&1310}\par "You're gonna drive me crazy with that shit, Weir."{&1310}\par I jerked back to myself at the sound of Komi's voice. I'd forgotten about her. Was she even there when I sat down? I don't know. I couldn't remember.{&1310}\par Tess' voice just continued on uninterrupted from the holographic image in front of me, not paying any attention to me or Komi. It rendered her in excruciatingly life-like detail -- so much so that I could almost forget it was just a recording. And over four months old, too. If I didn't think about it too much, I could almost imagine I was talking to her right \i now\i0 .{&1310}\par "... been about a week doing that. It really wasn't as much fun without you around. All they care about is finding some new way to split Shenlezite or re-inventing spaceship hulls or ... well, there was that one time I found out that guy your dad never liked -- you know, the guy Bertram had to throw out because he kept throwing up all over the floor that one night, screaming at us? Anyways, ... apparently he was working on some \i super\i0  secret project for a new weapon for a vice admiral or something and ..."{&1310}\par Komi groaned aloud and tried to stuff a pillow over her face where she was lying on her rack. "You've been going at it for over an hour!" She laid like that, covering her face and ears. I didn't look at her.{&1310}\par "Sorry," I said distractedly, but I didn't turn the recording off. I just switched to another one from about three-and-a-half months ago instead.{&1310}\par "... gonna start opening these messages with some really perverted shit. Just to see if that guy screening them notices." Tess laughed in the imager, shaking her loose, pinkish hair from side to side. "They'd probably block me for sure then. And where would you be, Ev? I'm probably the most important person you're gonna talk to while you're there. Speaking of which -- meet any admirals yet? Yeah, that lieutenant guy you're always talking about sounds like an asshole, but ... hey, I wonder if he's the one who's looking these over ... I guess you probably want to hear about what your dad has been up to." She sidestepped into another conversation entirely again with a groan, rolling her eyes at me. "Fine, but only because I \i know\i0  he's probably not leaving you as much messages as me ..."{&1310}\par I got a twinge and a sinking sort of feeling in my chest like too much blood was sitting there. Dad had never left me any messages. In six months, not one. But he had always been busy, and that made sense. Time froze for me here on the \i Soyorov\i0  -- from the moment I stepped foot inside the academy. The rest of the system had gone on without me outside. So had dad. Home. You couldn't tell from the way she talked to the holorecorder, but I was a ghost even to Tess. Every response was in delay and she'd probably already forgotten what it was like to be in the same room as me. Or even the same station. I could almost imagine that they had all just forgotten about me and I'd suddenly appear one day and someone might say, "who the hell is this girl who just shows up on a navy shuttle like she belongs here?" I wondered if that would make it any easier. Probably not.{&1310}\par "... do you remember that guy I told you about? The one who was working on the secret project for a captain? Or was it an admiral? ... Anyways, he was drinking at Bertram's one night last week and hella chatting me up when he got drunk -- bragging about it and \i everything\i0 .

I never would have realized just how much I would miss her out here. She was the closest thing I'd had to something like what Komi had. And it hurt to feel abandoned and left behind like this.{&1310}\par "You'll get to see them next week," Komi was saying. "You should be really excited."{&1310}\par My face must have registered some of what I was thinking. That, and I'd been playing these old messages a lot of late.

I had a lot of them.{&1310}\par "You shouldn't think about it like that."{&1310}\par "Why not?" I sighed, only half paying attention to her. I had said I was done and I was turning it off, but I'd lied. My fingers scrubbed idly across the holographic controls, swiping through message files on the screen. I don't know why I bothered sometimes. Tess' face jerked around in stopped motion between start frames in each recording, making her look like some weird martinet cycling through different facial expressions frozen in time until I hit 'play'. "It's not like I really belong here anyways," I mumbled under my breath.{&1310}\par I was in a funk, and feeling pretty miserable with myself. Maybe it had something to do with how close we had come to the end. All this time and effort and trying and ... I was as sure as I could be without the final word that I wasn't going to graduate. I kept thinking about all the mistakes I'd made along the way -- some of them so stupid in the moment that I wondered how I could have even let it happen -- and I wished I could just jump back in time and fix them. I didn't want to start over, but I didn't want to live with what I had already done either. It would be better if I just stayed home when I got there and never even came back for finals at all.{&1310}\par What were they going to do? Declare me AWOL?{&1310}\par "What do you mean?" Komi asked. Her flat tone told me that she already knew the answer but her mouth had gotten ahead of her head. We'd been shacked up for months together, but Komi had gotten ahead where I had fallen behind. Anywhere else and we would have been best friends or worst enemies by now. We kind of had been -- for a while, at least. Before it had started becoming obvious I wasn't cut out for this and wasn't making progress over my mistakes like most of the others were. Now there was just this growing rift of indifference for the weaker cadet, like cutting ties or sloughing of gangrene. Me. I was Komi's gangrenous limb. The platoon's. The academy's.{&1310}\par And, somehow, that made everything feel so much worse.{&1310}\par Again, I sighed.{&1310}\par "I don't know," I lied. "I can't \i do\i0  anything. My PK scores suck -- they don't even exist. PT is mediocre, maybe not even good enough for a regular recruit and-"{&1310}\par "You did great in front of Lieutenant Morisant yesterday, though."{&1310}\par "But that doesn't even ..."{&1310}\par I groaned heavily, irritably. And looked at her.{&1310}\par "You don't get it, Komi. \i You're\i0  going to make it. I'm not. I don't even have a chance." I was shaking my head. "Do you have any idea how that feels? \i No\i0 , you don't," I answered for her. "And nothing you say is going to change anything or make it better."{&1310}\par She stared back with her brown eyes out of her brown face at me. She looked military-crisp and also feminine and confident in herself at the same time in that subtle way the women in uniform I'd seen had. I looked at her and I could already see the officer. The powerful psychokinetic soldier. Her career mapped out in front of her like it was etched in lines of fate a long time ago and couldn't have been any different. And what did I see when I looked at myself in the mirror every morning before lights? Nothing. I was blank. I had no future here. I saw that and I was so sure that was what everyone else saw too that it took me aback for a second the way she touched my arm and spoke to me next.{&1310}\par "Weir," she started. "Evelyn." And she took a collective breath, fixing me with her dark, immaculate eyes. "One, that's not fair. You're comparing yourself to me and that's not fair. It doesn't matter. You get accepted or rejected on your own merits and no one is going to know or care what happened here once you get out and into the fleets. No one - not you, not the other officers, not Lieutenant Morisant. Not your father. No one.{&1310}\par "Two -- you keep beating yourself up like this and you \i will\i0  fail. You will. Finals will come and you will choke because you put so much pressure on doing everything exactly right that you can't let yourself breathe. Or think straight. You're just scared. But ... we all are. I am most of the time. You really aren't doing as badly as you think. I know. I've been here the whole time.{&1310}\par "Three."{&1310}\par She stopped, and if it were possible for that look to get any heavier or more forcefully intent on making sure I understood exactly what she was saying without a single doubt, it did. She squeezed her fingers tight into my arm and made me listen.{&1310}\par "You are going to make it. \i Believe\i0  it. Believe it. Go home and get your head straight. Practice every day until you can clear your mind and you'll find you have it in you. It's genetic. You just need the right atmosphere to open up in. You're father is very powerful. You have something there buried deep down inside you, not matter how small. And you're going to show them that when the time comes. I know you will."{&1310}\par "Okay."{&1310}\par "Yeah? Okay?"{&1310}\par It was hard to escape her and look away, but I did. I was a warring bundle of emotions that couldn't figure out if it was anger, bitterness, frustration, depression, or, maybe, hope that wanted to come out on top. They moved too quickly for me to decide, but there were tears burning in the corners of eyes. I swiped at them in exaggerated motions with a hand to do something -- anything -- and sniffed.{&1310}\par "Okay."{&1310}\par Komi tried to hug me, and I relented. I don't know if I'd changed my mind yet. I felt too out-of-sorts with myself.{&1310}\par The door chimed, and opened.{&1310}\par "Woah, sorry to break up the love-fest, girls, but-"{&1310}\par "Get the fuck out of here, Hammar," Komi spat almost immediatley with a flash of anger that was startling next to how softly she'd been talking to me just a second before. "What the hell makes you think you can just bust in here like that?"{&1310}\par "Woooaaah," the bigger cadet stuck up a hand. "Door wasn't locked okay?" I pushed back from Komi and quickly looked away while I scrubbed at my eyes. I couldn't help sniffing some more. Komi stood.{&1310}\par "You crying in here?" Hammar frowned and asked, staring past her at me. I put my hands over my face to block him out.{&1310}\par \i God. Fuck. Just stop looking at me.{&1310}\par \i0 "What the hell do you want, Hammar?" Komi was in front of him at the door, blocking most of his view of me. I realized without having noticed it before that someone was standing behind him. Miller. Of course.{&1310}\par "Calm down, Kominshk," Hammar was laughing her anger at him off like it didn't faze him. It probably didn't. When had it ever? "Just wanted to stop by and ask if you had any chance to think about coming out when we get back planetside again --"{&1310}\par "No."{&1310}\par "-- my dad'll be home on leave and he's got this fucking sweet yacht we could go cruising around in for a week or however long we want and --"{&1310}\par "No. No fucking way."{&1310}\par "-- he's already said we can do whatever we want-- what the fuck! Come on, Kominshk! It'll be great."{&1310}\par "Why the hell would I even want to do that? With you? I already blew you off once, Hammar. Did you think I didn't mean it or something? Christ!"{&1310}\par "Oh, come on! Just give me a chance, I mean -- we can go out to the Rift and pick up your friend-" he gestured over her shoulder at me "-Mills can come and he thinks she's kind of cute. Right? Tell her, Mills."{&1310}\par "Well, uh--"{&1310}\par "Yeah, like a double date or something. You know?"{&1310}\par Apparently she didn't know, though, because Komi's only response to that was to abruptly shove the other cadet back out of the way so she could shut the door right in their faces. It whirred closed and I heard Hammar swearing just outside in surprise. Komi stood there, still and staring at it with her fists balled at her sides, for about a minute before she finally turned back around{&1310}\par "Sorry," she apologized. She slumped back against the door, blowing her cheeks out as she sighed. I was mostly re-composed. My eyes were probably a little red, but clear.{&1310}\par "For what?"{&1310}\par She shook her head, barking a laugh at herself while her eyes blinked closed.{&1310}\par "I don't -- I don't even know." {&1310}\par A few seconds more and another sigh. {&1310}\par "Can you believe him?"{&1310}\par I shrugged, not really too worried about it compared to so many other things. {&1310}\par "If it were anyone else, I ... I don't know."{&1310}\par "You mean you \i don't\i0  like 'The Hammer'"?{&1310}\par "Seriously," she laughed it off, "fuck him. \i Seriously\i0 ."{&1310}\par "You're the one he wants," I teased, "not me."{&1310}\par She blinked, and the joke almost got past her in that state. I was the only one that got to see her break down her composure and show some reaction to all the shit that happened outside our bunkroom. She was so careful out there.{&1310}\par "Yeah, well ... sounds like Mills has a thing for \i you\i0  too."{&1310}\par "Probably just hopes to get to you by kissing up to me."{&1310}\par We were both laughing after all that. It was nice too, and I did start to feel better. Komi was grinning and opened her mouth to say something else. But the comm for the room. cut her off short.{&1310}\par "Cadet Weir."{&1310}\par Lieutenant Morisant's voice barged in -- cold, calm, and insistent. I froze on the spot. And I stayed that way for a split second too long before I remembered to actually answer him back.{&1310}\par "Yes ... a-aye, sir?"{&1310}\par "Report to Commander Delacroix's office. Immediately."\cf2\f2 {&1310}\par }{&1310}

I had said I was done and I was turning it off, but I'd lied. My fingers scrubbed idly across the holographic controls, swiping through message files on the screen. I don't know why I bothered sometimes. Tess' face jerked around in stopped motion between start frames in each recording, making her look like some weird martinet cycling through different facial expressions frozen in time until I hit 'play'. "It's not like I really belong here anyways," I mumbled under my breath.{&1310}\par I was in a funk, and feeling pretty miserable with myself. Maybe it had something to do with how close we had come to the end. All this time and effort and trying and ... I was as sure as I could be without the final word that I wasn't going to graduate. I kept thinking about all the mistakes I'd made along the way -- some of them so stupid in the moment that I wondered how I could have even let it happen -- and I wished I could just jump back in time and fix them. I didn't want to start over, but I didn't want to live with what I had already done either. It would be better if I just stayed home when I got there and never even came back for finals at all.{&1310}\par What were they going to do? Declare me AWOL?{&1310}\par "What do you mean?" Komi asked. Her flat tone told me that she already knew the answer but her mouth had gotten ahead of her head. We'd been shacked up for months together, but Komi had gotten ahead where I had fallen behind. Anywhere else and we would have been best friends or worst enemies by now. We kind of had been -- for a while, at least. Before it had started becoming obvious I wasn't cut out for this and wasn't making progress over my mistakes like most of the others were. Now there was just this growing rift of indifference for the weaker cadet, like cutting ties or sloughing of gangrene. Me. I was Komi's gangrenous limb. The platoon's. The academy's.{&1310}\par And, somehow, that made everything feel so much worse.{&1310}\par Again, I sighed.{&1310}\par "I don't know," I lied. "I can't \i do\i0  anything. My PK scores suck -- they don't even exist. PT is mediocre, maybe not even good enough for a regular recruit and-"{&1310}\par "You did great in front of Lieutenant Morisant yesterday, though."{&1310}\par "But that doesn't even ..."{&1310}\par I groaned heavily, irritably. And looked at her.{&1310}\par "You don't get it, Komi. \i You're\i0  going to make it. I'm not. I don't even have a chance." I was shaking my head. "Do you have any idea how that feels? \i No\i0 , you don't," I answered for her. "And nothing you say is going to change anything or make it better."{&1310}\par She stared back with her brown eyes out of her brown face at me. She looked military-crisp and also feminine and confident in herself at the same time in that subtle way the women in uniform I'd seen had. I looked at her and I could already see the officer. The powerful psychokinetic soldier. Her career mapped out in front of her like it was etched in lines of fate a long time ago and couldn't have been any different. And what did I see when I looked at myself in the mirror every morning before lights? Nothing. I was blank. I had no future here. I saw that and I was so sure that was what everyone else saw too that it took me aback for a second the way she touched my arm and spoke to me next.{&1310}\par "Weir," she started. "Evelyn." And she took a collective breath, fixing me with her dark, immaculate eyes. "One, that's not fair. You're comparing yourself to me and that's not fair. It doesn't matter. You get accepted or rejected on your own merits and no one is going to know or care what happened here once you get out and into the fleets. No one - not you, not the other officers, not Lieutenant Morisant. Not your father. No one.{&1310}\par "Two -- you keep beating yourself up like this and you \i will\i0  fail. You will. Finals will come and you will choke because you put so much pressure on doing everything exactly right that you can't let yourself breathe. Or think straight. You're just scared. But ... we all are. I am most of the time. You really aren't doing as badly as you think. I know. I've been here the whole time.{&1310}\par "Three."{&1310}\par She stopped, and if it were possible for that look to get any heavier or more forcefully intent on making sure I understood exactly what she was saying without a single doubt, it did. She squeezed her fingers tight into my arm and made me listen.{&1310}\par "You are going to make it. \i Believe\i0  it. Believe it. Go home and get your head straight. Practice every day until you can clear your mind and you'll find you have it in you. It's genetic. You just need the right atmosphere to open up in. You're father is very powerful. You have something there buried deep down inside you, not matter how small. And you're going to show them that when the time comes. I know you will."{&1310}\par "Okay."{&1310}\par "Yeah? Okay?"{&1310}\par It was hard to escape her and look away, but I did. I was a warring bundle of emotions that couldn't figure out if it was anger, bitterness, frustration, depression, or, maybe, hope that wanted to come out on top. They moved too quickly for me to decide, but there were tears burning in the corners of eyes. I swiped at them in exaggerated motions with a hand to do something -- anything -- and sniffed.{&1310}\par "Okay."{&1310}\par Komi tried to hug me, and I relented. I don't know if I'd changed my mind yet. I felt too out-of-sorts with myself.{&1310}\par The door chimed, and opened.{&1310}\par "Woah, sorry to break up the love-fest, girls, but-"{&1310}\par "Get the fuck out of here, Hammar," Komi spat almost immediatley with a flash of anger that was startling next to how softly she'd been talking to me just a second before. "What the hell makes you think you can just bust in here like that?"{&1310}\par "Woooaaah," the bigger cadet stuck up a hand. "Door wasn't locked okay?" I pushed back from Komi and quickly looked away while I scrubbed at my eyes. I couldn't help sniffing some more. Komi stood.{&1310}\par "You crying in here?" Hammar frowned and asked, staring past her at me. I put my hands over my face to block him out.{&1310}\par \i God. Fuck. Just stop looking at me.{&1310}\par \i0 "What the hell do you want, Hammar?" Komi was in front of him at the door, blocking most of his view of me. I realized without having noticed it before that someone was standing behind him. Miller. Of course.{&1310}\par "Calm down, Kominshk," Hammar was laughing her anger at him off like it didn't faze him. It probably didn't. When had it ever? "Just wanted to stop by and ask if you had any chance to think about coming out when we get back planetside again --"{&1310}\par "No."{&1310}\par "-- my dad'll be home on leave and he's got this fucking sweet yacht we could go cruising around in for a week or however long we want and --"{&1310}\par "No. No fucking way."{&1310}\par "-- he's already said we can do whatever we want-- what the fuck! Come on, Kominshk! It'll be great."{&1310}\par "Why the hell would I even want to do that? With you? I already blew you off once, Hammar. Did you think I didn't mean it or something? Christ!"{&1310}\par "Oh, come on! Just give me a chance, I mean -- we can go out to the Rift and pick up your friend-" he gestured over her shoulder at me "-Mills can come and he thinks she's kind of cute. Right? Tell her, Mills."{&1310}\par "Well, uh--"{&1310}\par "Yeah, like a double date or something. You know?"{&1310}\par Apparently she didn't know, though, because Komi's only response to that was to abruptly shove the other cadet back out of the way so she could shut the door right in their faces. It whirred closed and I heard Hammar swearing just outside in surprise. Komi stood there, still and staring at it with her fists balled at her sides, for about a minute before she finally turned back around{&1310}\par "Sorry," she apologized. She slumped back against the door, blowing her cheeks out as she sighed. I was mostly re-composed. My eyes were probably a little red, but clear.{&1310}\par "For what?"{&1310}\par She shook her head, barking a laugh at herself while her eyes blinked closed.{&1310}\par "I don't -- I don't even know." {&1310}\par A few seconds more and another sigh. {&1310}\par "Can you believe him?"{&1310}\par I shrugged, not really too worried about it compared to so many other things. {&1310}\par "If it were anyone else, I ... I don't know."{&1310}\par "You mean you \i don't\i0  like 'The Hammer'"?{&1310}\par "Seriously," she laughed it off, "fuck him. \i Seriously\i0 ."{&1310}\par "You're the one he wants," I teased, "not me."{&1310}\par She blinked, and the joke almost got past her. I was the only one that got to see her break down her composure and show some reaction to all the shit that happened outside our bunkroom. She was so careful out there.{&1310}\par "Yeah, well ... sounds like Mills has a thing for \i you\i0  too."{&1310}\par "Probably just hopes to get to you by kissing up to me. Everyone here thinks you're the best."{&1310}\par We were both laughing now. It was nice too, and I did start to feel better.{&1310}\par "You really are the best," I repeated. "You know that?"{&1310}\par Komi's face lit up at that. I didn't expect her to take a compliment from me -- the worst-performing cadet on the whole ship -- as worth much. But the way she smiled and started to blush, you'd think I was Lieutenant Morisant telling her that. Which was weird. Because she opened her mouth to say something and the comm for the room cut her off short.{&1310}\par "Cadet Weir."{&1310}\par Speak of the devil.{&1310}\par Lieutenant Morisant's voice barged in -- cold, calm, and insistent. Somehow I'd summoned him and his attention just by thinking about it. It wasn't even that bad of a joke, really. They said natural psychokinetics with enough power could read people's thoughts as plain as day, and they had a sixth sense about things. Not that I'd met any of them. Even dad never talked about it, so who knew.{&1310}\par But it was then that I realized just who he had called for. And that he had called specifically to our bunkroom. In almost six months -- that had never happened to a cadet. Not once. At least, that I knew of.{&1310}\par So, I froze there on the spot like I'd just been called out to get my ass chewed in front of the whole unit. Like I did far, far too often.{&1310}\par "Cadet Kominshk," the lieutenant continued in a slightly different tone that must have been his version of irritated.{&1310}\par "Aye, sir?"{&1310}\par "Is Cadet Weir asleep?"{&1310}\par "Uh, no, sir, she's-"{&1310}\par "I'm h-here, sir," I cut her off again as quickly as I could. I couldn't keep that tremble out of my voice as I did it, though.{&1310}\par "Then report to Commander Delacroix's office, cadet. Immediately."{&1310}\par And the comm went dead before either of us could think to say anything more.\cf2\f2 {&1310}\par }{&1310}

Kind of ... \i weird\i0  ... leaving a message likes this. I mean, how do I even know if you'll get this? They're gonna screen it right? So what if I say something they don't want you to hear or think will distract you from whatever their screaming in your face everyday or -- I don't know. I \i really\i0  wish this was a live feed. Who the hell leaves messages anymore, anyways? Unless, I guess, you aren't around or something, and I have to get the machine ...{&1310}\par "... anyways ... I just got done for the day at Bertram's and wanted to try this out -- not used to leaving messages that some crew-cut military guy might listen to, you know? Probably an asshole too ... Shit. I wonder if they'll flag me for calling some navy asshole an asshole ... Whatever. Just make sure you send me a message back, okay? That's the only way I'll know if this works or not and I should do it again. I mean, \i of course\i0  I \i should\i0  do it, but ... I feel like I'm talking to myself here. Crazy. Good thing no one's around to see me talking to myself. Except that asshole who's gonna screen this whole thing, I guess ... And you, Ev ..."{&1310}\par "You're gonna drive me crazy with that shit, Weir."{&1310}\par I jerked back to myself at the sound of Komi's voice. I'd forgotten about her. Was she even there when I sat down? I don't know. I couldn't remember.{&1310}\par Tess' voice just continued on uninterrupted from the holographic image in front of me, not paying any attention to me or Komi. It rendered her in excruciatingly life-like detail -- so much so that I could almost forget it was just a recording. And over four months old, too. If I didn't think about it too much, I could almost imagine I was talking to her right \i now\i0 .{&1310}\par "... been about a week doing that. It really wasn't as much fun without you around. All they care about is finding some new way to split Shenlezite or re-inventing spaceship hulls or ... well, there was that one time I found out that guy your dad never liked -- you know, the guy Bertram had to throw out because he kept throwing up all over the floor that one night, screaming at us? Anyways, ... apparently he was working on some \i super\i0  secret project for a new weapon for a vice admiral or something and ..."{&1310}\par Komi groaned aloud and tried to stuff a pillow over her face where she was lying on her rack. "You've been going at it for over an hour!" She laid like that, covering her face and ears. I didn't look at her.{&1310}\par "Sorry," I said distractedly, but I didn't turn the recording off. I just switched to another one from about three-and-a-half months ago instead.{&1310}\par "... gonna start opening these messages with some really perverted shit. Just to see if that guy screening them notices." Tess laughed in the imager, shaking her loose, pinkish hair from side to side. "They'd probably block me for sure then. And where would you be, Ev? I'm probably the most important person you're gonna talk to while you're there. Speaking of which -- meet any admirals yet? Yeah, that lieutenant guy you're always talking about sounds like an asshole, but ... hey, I wonder if he's the one who's looking these over ... I guess you probably want to hear about what your dad has been up to." She sidestepped into another conversation entirely again with a groan, rolling her eyes at me. "Fine, but only because I \i know\i0  he's probably not leaving you as much messages as me ..."{&1310}\par I got a twinge and a sinking sort of feeling in my chest like too much blood was sitting there. Dad had never left me any messages. In six months, not one. But he had always been busy, and that made sense. Time froze for me here on the \i Soyorov\i0  -- from the moment I stepped foot inside the academy, but the rest of the system had gone on without me outside. So had dad. Home. You couldn't tell from the way she talked to the holorecorder, but I was a ghost even to Tess. Every response was in delay and she'd probably already forgotten what it was like to be in the same room as me. Or even the same station. I could almost imagine that they had all just forgotten about me and I'd suddenly appear one day and someone might say, "who the hell is this girl who just shows up on a navy shuttle like she belongs here?" I wondered if that would make it any easier. Probably not.{&1310}\par "... do you remember that guy I told you about? The one who was working on the secret project for a captain? Or was it an admiral? ... Anyways, he was drinking at Bertram's one night last week and hella chatting me up when he got drunk -- bragging about it and \i everything\i0 . Trying to impress me and get me to talk to him, you know? Like he wasn't old and kind of gross-looking. Something about 'supercoliding new particles' and super secret shit like that. You wonder how he doesn't get transfered off-station or fired or something ..."{&1310}\par "I give up."{&1310}\par Komi kicked her legs out and sat up, squeezing the heels of her hands into her eyes. I don't think she'd slept much last night. More than usual, anyways. No one slept much -- ever. They wouldn't let you.{&1310}\par I felt kind of bad, though, blinking back to reality and realizing she couldn't get any rest with me playing old messages out loud like that. I looked at her apologetically.{&1310}\par "I'll turn it off," I promised. "I'm done. You can get some sleep."{&1310}\par "It'd be nice," she grumbled, seemed to think better of it, rolled her eyes, and sighed. "She's your best friend ... and you haven't seen her in half a year. I know how that is."{&1310}\par Komi had a big family back home in one of the smaller cities on Haiwayee, with a younger bother and sister who were twins and she was very close to. I was probably the only one in this place who knew just how much she missed them everyday. They left her messages all the time. Silly, happy little things that you'd expect kids to make. I got to see a few -- it wasn't like we got much privacy from each other -- and those two were so bright and sweet and full of life that it made my heart wrench. With a family like that back home, I wondered sometimes why Komi was even here. They were beautiful.{&1310}\par I had Tess, and dad. And I guess Bertram too. Not much else back home on Riftwatch station where the brightest minds of the Dreggoran navies gathered to discover the next great thing to help the Grand Admirals win their war against piracy or gain an edge against the other planetary systems. It was easy to walk away from, especially when I'd had them for so long already and dad wanted me to. At least, that's what I'd thought six months ago. I'd told Tess to keep in touch, but ... I never would have realized just how much I would miss her out here. She was the closest thing I'd had to something like what Komi had. And it hurt to feel abandoned and left behind like this.{&1310}\par "You'll get to see them next week," Komi was saying. "You should be really excited."{&1310}\par My face must have registered some of what I was thinking. That, and I'd been playing these old messages a lot of late. I wasn't excited, though, I don't think. Scared, maybe. Anxious. It felt weird to imagine going home after all this time. I told her as much.{&1310}\par "I know. Six months is a long time away from everyone. It'll be even longer when we come back, you know."{&1310}\par "\i If\i0  we come back," I said, and I couldn't help it sounding bitter. I had my doubts. I had a lot of them.{&1310}\par "You shouldn't think about it like that."{&1310}\par "Why not?" {&1310}\par I sighed, but it was just rhetorical since I was still only half paying attention to her. I had said I was done and I was turning it off, but I'd lied. My fingers scrubbed idly across the holographic controls, swiping through message files on the screen. I don't know why I bothered sometimes. Tess' face jerked around in stopped motion between start frames in each recording, making her look like some kind of weird martinet cycling through different facial expressions frozen in time until I hit 'play'. "It's not like I really belong here anyways," I mumbled under my breath.{&1310}\par I was in a funk, and feeling pretty miserable with myself. Maybe it had something to do with how close we had come to the end. All this time and effort and trying and ... I was as sure as I could be without the final word that I wasn't going to graduate. I kept thinking about all the mistakes I'd made along the way -- some of them so stupid in the moment that I wondered how I could have even let it happen, the memory was burned so embarassingly into my head forever -- and I wished I could just jump back in time and make it so they never happened. Sometimes I felt like I should never have come here. I didn't want to start over, but I didn't want to live with what I had already done either. It would be better if I just stayed home when I got back there and never even came back for finals at all.{&1310}\par What were they going to do? Declare me AWOL? It's not like they wanted me anyways.{&1310}\par "What do you mean?" Komi asked. Her flat tone told me that she already knew the answer but her mouth had gotten ahead of her head. We'd been shacked up for months together, but Komi had gotten ahead where I had fallen behind. Anywhere else and we would have been best friends or worst enemies by now.

And looked at her.{&1310}\par "You don't get it, Komi. \i You're\i0  going to make it. I'm not. I don't even have a chance." I was shaking my head. "Do you have any idea how that feels? \i No\i0 , you don't," I answered for her.

I was the only one who got to see her break down her composure and show some reaction to all the shit that happened outside our bunkroom. She was so careful out there.{&1310}\par "Yeah, well ... sounds like Mills has a thing for \i you\i0  too."{&1310}\par "Probably just hopes to get to you by kissing up to me. Everyone here thinks you're the best."{&1310}\par We were both laughing now. It was nice too, and I did start to feel better.{&1310}\par "You really are the best," I repeated. "You know that?"{&1310}\par Komi's face lit up at that. I didn't expect her to take a compliment from me -- the worst-performing cadet on the whole ship -- as worth much. But the way she smiled and started to blush, you'd think I was Lieutenant Morisant telling her that. Which was weird. Because she opened her mouth to say something and the comm for the room cut her off short.{&1310}\par "Cadet Weir."{&1310}\par Speak of the devil.{&1310}\par Lieutenant Morisant's voice barged in -- cold, calm, and insistent. Somehow I'd summoned him and his attention just by thinking about it. It wasn't even that bad of a joke, really. They said natural psychokinetics with enough power could read people's thoughts as plain as day, and they had a sixth sense about things. Not that I'd met any of them. Even dad never talked about it, so who knew.{&1310}\par But it was then that I realized just who he had called for. And that he had called specifically to our bunkroom. In almost six months -- that had never happened to a cadet. Not once. At least, that I knew of.{&1310}\par So, I froze there on the spot like I'd just been called out to get my ass chewed in front of the whole unit.

I couldn't keep that tremble out of my voice as I did it, though. God damnit. {&1310}\par Every time.{&1310}\par "Then report to Commander Delacroix's office, cadet.

Kind of ... \i weird\i0  ... leaving a message likes this. I mean, how do I even know if you'll get this? They're gonna screen it right? So what if I say something they don't want you to hear or think will distract you from whatever their screaming in your face everyday or -- I don't know. I \i really\i0  wish this was a live feed. Who the hell leaves messages anymore, anyways? Unless, I guess, you aren't around or something, and I have to get the machine ...{&1310}\par "... anyways ... I just got done for the day at Bertram's and wanted to try this out -- not used to leaving messages that some crew-cut military guy might listen to, you know? Probably an asshole too ... Shit. I wonder if they'll flag me for calling some navy asshole an asshole ... Whatever. Just make sure you send me a message back, okay? That's the only way I'll know if this works or not and I should do it again. I mean, \i of course\i0  I \i should\i0  do it, but ... I feel like I'm talking to myself here. Crazy. Good thing no one's around to see me talking to myself. Except that asshole who's gonna screen this whole thing, I guess ... And you, Ev ..."{&1310}\par "You're gonna drive me crazy with that shit, Weir."{&1310}\par I jerked back to myself at the sound of Komi's voice. I'd forgotten about her. Was she even there when I sat down? I don't know. I couldn't remember.{&1310}\par Tess' voice just continued on uninterrupted from the holographic image in front of me, not paying any attention to me or Komi. It rendered her in excruciatingly life-like detail -- so much so that I could almost forget it was just a recording. And over four months old, too. If I didn't think about it too much, I could almost imagine I was talking to her right \i now\i0 .{&1310}\par "... been about a week doing that. It really wasn't as much fun without you around. All they care about is finding some new way to split Shenlezite or re-inventing spaceship hulls or ... well, there was that one time I found out that guy your dad never liked -- you know, the guy Bertram had to throw out because he kept throwing up all over the floor that one night, screaming at us? Anyways, ... apparently he was working on some \i super\i0  secret project for a new weapon for a vice admiral or something and ..."{&1310}\par Komi groaned aloud and tried to stuff a pillow over her face where she was lying on her rack. "You've been going at it for over an hour!" She laid like that, covering her face and ears. I didn't look at her.{&1310}\par "Sorry," I said distractedly, but I didn't turn the recording off. I just switched to another one from about three-and-a-half months ago instead.{&1310}\par "... gonna start opening these messages with some really perverted shit. Just to see if that guy screening them notices." Tess laughed in the imager, shaking her loose, pinkish hair from side to side. "They'd probably block me for sure then. And where would you be, Ev? I'm probably the most important person you're gonna talk to while you're there. Speaking of which -- meet any admirals yet? Yeah, that lieutenant guy you're always talking about sounds like an asshole, but ... hey, I wonder if he's the one who's looking these over ... I guess you probably want to hear about what your dad has been up to." She sidestepped into another conversation entirely again with a groan, rolling her eyes at me. "Fine, but only because I \i know\i0  he's probably not leaving you as much messages as me ..."{&1310}\par I got a twinge and a sinking sort of feeling in my chest like too much blood was sitting there. Dad had never left me any messages. In six months, not one. But he had always been busy, and that made sense. Time froze for me here on the \i Soyorov\i0  -- from the moment I stepped foot inside the academy, but the rest of the system had gone on without me outside. So had dad. Home. You couldn't tell from the way she talked to the holorecorder, but I was a ghost even to Tess. Every response was in delay and she'd probably already forgotten what it was like to be in the same room as me. Or even the same station. I could almost imagine that they had all just forgotten about me and I'd suddenly appear one day and someone might say, "who the hell is this girl who just shows up on a navy shuttle like she belongs here?" I wondered if that would make it any easier. Probably not.{&1310}\par "... do you remember that guy I told you about? The one who was working on the secret project for a captain? Or was it an admiral? ... Anyways, he was drinking at Bertram's one night last week and hella chatting me up when he got drunk -- bragging about it and \i everything\i0 . Trying to impress me and get me to talk to him, you know? Like he wasn't old and kind of gross-looking. Something about 'supercoliding new particles' and super secret shit like that. You wonder how he doesn't get transfered off-station or fired or something ..."{&1310}\par "I give up."{&1310}\par Komi kicked her legs out and sat up, squeezing the heels of her hands into her eyes. I don't think she'd slept much last night. More than usual, anyways. No one slept much -- ever. They wouldn't let you.{&1310}\par I felt kind of bad, though, blinking back to reality and realizing she couldn't get any rest with me playing old messages out loud like that. I looked at her apologetically.{&1310}\par "I'll turn it off," I promised. "I'm done. You can get some sleep."{&1310}\par "It'd be nice," she grumbled, seemed to think better of it, rolled her eyes, and sighed. "She's your best friend ... and you haven't seen her in half a year. I know how that is."{&1310}\par Komi had a big family back home in one of the smaller cities on Haiwayee, with a younger bother and sister who were twins and she was very close to. I was probably the only one in this place who knew just how much she missed them everyday. They left her messages all the time. Silly, happy little things that you'd expect kids to make. I got to see a few -- it wasn't like we got much privacy from each other -- and those two were so bright and sweet and full of life that it made my heart wrench. With a family like that back home, I wondered sometimes why Komi was even here. They were beautiful.{&1310}\par I had Tess, and dad. And I guess Bertram too. Not much else back home on Riftwatch station where the brightest minds of the Dreggoran navies gathered to discover the next great thing to help the Grand Admirals win their war against piracy or gain an edge against the other planetary systems. It was easy to walk away from, especially when I'd had them for so long already and dad wanted me to. At least, that's what I'd thought six months ago. I'd told Tess to keep in touch, but ... I never would have realized just how much I would miss her out here. She was the closest thing I'd had to something like what Komi had. And it hurt to feel abandoned and left behind like this.{&1310}\par "You'll get to see them next week," Komi was saying. "You should be really excited."{&1310}\par My face must have registered some of what I was thinking. That, and I'd been playing these old messages a lot of late. I wasn't excited, though, I don't think. Scared, maybe. Anxious. It felt weird to imagine going home after all this time. I told her as much.{&1310}\par "I know. Six months is a long time away from everyone. It'll be even longer when we come back, you know."{&1310}\par "\i If\i0  we come back," I said, and I couldn't help it sounding bitter. I had my doubts. I had a lot of them.{&1310}\par "You shouldn't think about it like that."{&1310}\par "Why not?" {&1310}\par I sighed, but it was just rhetorical since I was still only half paying attention to her. I had said I was done and I was turning it off, but I'd lied. My fingers scrubbed idly across the holographic controls, swiping through message files on the screen. I don't know why I bothered sometimes. Tess' face jerked around in stopped motion between start frames in each recording, making her look like some kind of weird martinet cycling through different facial expressions frozen in time until I hit 'play'. "It's not like I really belong here anyways," I mumbled under my breath.{&1310}\par I was in a funk, and feeling pretty miserable with myself. Maybe it had something to do with how close we had come to the end. All this time and effort and trying and ... I was as sure as I could be without the final word that I wasn't going to graduate. I kept thinking about all the mistakes I'd made along the way -- some of them so stupid in the moment that I wondered how I could have even let it happen, the memory was burned so embarassingly into my head forever -- and I wished I could just jump back in time and make it so they never happened. Sometimes I felt like I should never have come here. I didn't want to start over, but I didn't want to live with what I had already done either. It would be better if I just stayed home when I got back there and never even came back for finals at all.{&1310}\par What were they going to do? Declare me AWOL? It's not like they wanted me anyways.{&1310}\par "What do you mean?" Komi asked. Her flat tone told me that she already knew the answer but her mouth had gotten ahead of her head. We'd been shacked up for months together, but Komi had gotten ahead where I had fallen behind. Anywhere else and we would have been best friends or worst enemies by now. We kind of had been -- for a while, at least. Before it had started becoming obvious I wasn't cut out for this and wasn't making progress over my mistakes like most of the others were. Now there was just this growing rift of indifference for the weaker cadet, like cutting ties or sloughing of gangrene. Me. I was Komi's gangrenous limb. The platoon's. The academy's.{&1310}\par And, somehow, that made everything feel so much worse.{&1310}\par Again, I sighed.{&1310}\par "I don't know," I lied. "I can't \i do\i0  anything. My PK scores suck -- they don't even exist. PT is mediocre, maybe not even good enough for a regular recruit and-"{&1310}\par "You did great in front of Lieutenant Morisant yesterday, though."{&1310}\par "But that doesn't even ..."{&1310}\par I groaned heavily, irritably. And looked at her.{&1310}\par "You don't get it, Komi. \i You're\i0  going to make it. I'm not. I don't even have a chance." I was shaking my head. "Do you have any idea how that feels? \i No\i0 , you don't," I answered for her. "And nothing you say is going to change anything or make it better."{&1310}\par She stared back with her brown eyes out of her brown face at me. She looked military-crisp and also feminine and confident in herself at the same time in that subtle way the women in uniform I'd seen had. I looked at her and I could already see the officer. The powerful psychokinetic soldier. Her career mapped out in front of her like it'd been etched in lines of fate a long time ago and couldn't have been any different. And what did I see when I looked at myself in the mirror every morning before lights? Nothing. I was blank. I had no future here. I saw that and I was so sure that that was what everyone else saw too that it took me aback for a second the way she touched my arm and spoke to me next.{&1310}\par "Weir," she started. "Evelyn." And she took a collective breath, fixing me with her dark, immaculate eyes. "One, that's not fair. You're comparing yourself to me and that's not fair. It doesn't matter. You get accepted or rejected on your own merits and no one is going to know or care what happened here once you get out and into the fleets. No one - not you, not the other officers, not Lieutenant Morisant. Not your father. No one.{&1310}\par "Two -- you keep beating yourself up like this and you \i will\i0  fail. You will. Finals will come and you will choke because you put so much pressure on doing everything exactly right that you can't let yourself breathe. Or think straight. You're just scared. But ... we all are. I am most of the time. You really aren't doing as badly as you think. I know. I've been here the whole time.{&1310}\par "Three."{&1310}\par She stopped, and if it were possible for that look to get any heavier or more forcefully intent on making sure I understood exactly what she was saying without a single doubt, it did. She squeezed her fingers tight into my arm and made me listen.{&1310}\par "You are going to make it. \i Believe\i0  it. Believe it. Go home and get your head straight. Practice every day until you can clear your mind and you'll find you have it in you. It's genetic. You just need the right atmosphere to open up in. You're father is very powerful. You have something there buried deep down inside you, no matter how small. And you're going to show them that when the time comes. I know you will."{&1310}\par "Okay."{&1310}\par "Yeah? Okay?"{&1310}\par It was hard to escape her and look away, but I did. I was a warring bundle of emotions that couldn't figure out if it was anger, bitterness, frustration, depression, or, maybe, hope that wanted to come out on top. They moved too quickly for me to decide, but there were tears burning in the corners of my eyes. I swiped at them in exaggerated motions with a hand to do something -- anything -- and sniffed.{&1310}\par "Okay."{&1310}\par Komi tried to hug me, and I relented. I don't know if I'd changed my mind yet. I felt too out-of-sorts with myself.{&1310}\par The door chimed, and opened.{&1310}\par "Woah, sorry to break up the love-fest, girls, but-"{&1310}\par "Get the fuck out of here, Hammar," Komi spat almost immediatley with a flash of anger that was startling next to how softly she'd been talking to me just a second before. "What the hell makes you think you can just bust in here like that?"{&1310}\par "Woooaaah," the bigger cadet stuck up a hand. "Door wasn't locked okay?" I pushed back from Komi and quickly looked away while I scrubbed at my eyes. I couldn't help sniffing some more. Komi stood.{&1310}\par "You crying in here?" Hammar frowned and asked, staring past her at me. I put my hands over my face to block him out.{&1310}\par \i God. Fuck. Just stop looking at me.{&1310}\par \i0 "What the hell do you want, Hammar?" Komi was in front of him at the door, blocking most of his view of me. I realized without having noticed it before that someone was standing behind him. Miller. Of course.{&1310}\par "Calm down, Kominshk," Hammar was laughing her anger at him off like it didn't faze him. It probably didn't. When had it ever? "Just wanted to stop by and ask if you had any chance to think about coming out when we get back planetside again --"{&1310}\par "No."{&1310}\par "-- my dad'll be home on leave and he's got this fucking sweet yacht we could go cruising around in for a week or however long we want and --"{&1310}\par "No. No fucking way."{&1310}\par "-- he's already said we can do whatever we want and-- what the fuck! Come on, Kominshk! It'll be -- It'll be \i great\i0 ."{&1310}\par "Why the \i hell \i0 would I even want to do that? With you? I already blew you off once, Hammar. Did you think I didn't mean it or something? Christ!"{&1310}\par "Oh, come on! Just give me a chance, I mean -- we can go out to the Rift and pick up your friend--" he gestured over her shoulder at me "--Mills can come, and he thinks she's kind of cute. Right? Tell her, Mills."{&1310}\par "Well, uh--"{&1310}\par "Yeah, like a double date or something. You know?"{&1310}\par Apparently she didn't know, though, because Komi's only response to that was to abruptly shove the other cadet back out of the way so she could shut the door right in their faces. It whirred closed and I heard Hammar swearing just outside in surprise. Komi stood there, still and staring at it with her fists balled at her sides, for about a minute before she finally turned back around{&1310}\par "Sorry," she apologized. She slumped back against the door, blowing her cheeks out as she sighed. I was mostly re-composed. My eyes were probably a little red, but clear.{&1310}\par "For what?"{&1310}\par She shook her head, barking a laugh at herself while her eyes blinked closed.{&1310}\par "I don't -- I don't even know." {&1310}\par A few seconds more and another sigh that turned into a half sort of bitter laugh. {&1310}\par "Can you believe him?"{&1310}\par I shrugged, not really too worried about it compared to so many other things. {&1310}\par "If it were anyone else, I ... I don't know."{&1310}\par "You mean you \i don't\i0  like 'The Hammer'"?{&1310}\par "Seriously," she laughed it off, "fuck him. \i Seriously\i0 ."{&1310}\par "You're the one he wants," I teased, "not me."{&1310}\par She blinked, and the joke almost got past her. I was the only one who got to see her break down her composure and show some reaction to all the shit that happened outside our bunkroom.

You can get some sleep."{&1310}\par "It'd be nice," she grumbled, seemed to think better of it, rolled her eyes, and sighed. "She's your best friend ... and you haven't seen her in half a year. I know how that is."{&1310}\par Komi had a big family back home in one of the smaller cities on Haiwayee, with a younger bother and sister who were twins and she was very close to. I was probably the only one in this place who knew just how much she missed them everyday. They left her messages all the time. Silly, happy little things that you'd expect kids to make. I got to see a few -- it wasn't like we got much privacy from each other -- and those two were so bright and sweet and full of life that it made my heart wrench. With a family like that back home, I wondered sometimes why Komi was even here. They were beautiful.{&1310}\par I had Tess, and dad. And I guess Bertram too. Not much else back home on Riftwatch station where the brightest minds of the Dreggoran navies gathered to discover the next great thing to help the Grand Admirals win their war against piracy or gain an edge against the other planetary systems. It was easy to walk away from, especially when I'd had them for so long already and dad wanted me to. At least, that's what I'd thought six months ago. I'd told Tess to keep in touch, but ... I never would have realized just how much I would miss her out here. She was the closest thing I'd had to something like what Komi had. And it hurt to feel abandoned and left behind like this.{&1310}\par "You'll get to see them next week," Komi was saying. "You should be really excited."{&1310}\par My face must have registered some of what I was thinking. That, and I'd been playing these old messages a lot of late. I wasn't excited, though, I don't think. Scared, maybe. Anxious. It felt weird to imagine going home after all this time. I told her as much.{&1310}\par "I know. Six months is a long time away from everyone. It'll be even longer when we come back, you know."{&1310}\par "\i If\i0  we come back," I said, and I couldn't help it sounding bitter. I had my doubts. I had a lot of them.{&1310}\par "You shouldn't think about it like that."{&1310}\par "Why not?" {&1310}\par I sighed, but it was just rhetorical since I was still only half paying attention to her. I had said I was done and I was turning it off, but I'd lied. My fingers scrubbed idly across the holographic controls, swiping through message files on the screen. I don't know why I bothered sometimes. Tess' face jerked around in stopped motion between start frames in each recording, making her look like some kind of weird martinet cycling through different facial expressions frozen in time until I hit 'play'. "It's not like I really belong here anyways," I mumbled under my breath.{&1310}\par I was in a funk, and feeling pretty miserable with myself. Maybe it had something to do with how close we had come to the end. All this time and effort and trying and ... I was as sure as I could be without the final word that I wasn't going to graduate. I kept thinking about all the mistakes I'd made along the way -- some of them so stupid in the moment that I wondered how I could have even let it happen, the memory was burned so embarassingly into my head forever -- and I wished I could just jump back in time and make it so they never happened. Sometimes I felt like I should never have come here. I didn't want to start over, but I didn't want to live with what I had already done either. It would be better if I just stayed home when I got back there and never even came back for finals at all.{&1310}\par What were they going to do? Declare me AWOL? It's not like they wanted me anyways.{&1310}\par "What do you mean?" Komi asked. Her flat tone told me that she already knew the answer but her mouth had gotten ahead of her head. We'd been shacked up for months together, but Komi had gotten ahead where I had fallen behind. Anywhere else and we would have been best friends or worst enemies by now. We kind of had been -- for a while, at least. Before it had started becoming obvious I wasn't cut out for this and wasn't making progress over my mistakes like most of the others were. Now there was just this growing rift of indifference for the weaker cadet, like cutting ties or sloughing of gangrene. Me. I was Komi's gangrenous limb. The platoon's. The academy's.{&1310}\par And, somehow, that made everything feel so much worse.{&1310}\par Again, I sighed.{&1310}\par "I don't know," I lied. "I can't \i do\i0  anything. My PK scores suck -- they don't even exist. PT is mediocre, maybe not even good enough for a regular recruit and-"{&1310}\par "You did great in front of Lieutenant Morisant yesterday, though."{&1310}\par "But that doesn't even ..."{&1310}\par I groaned heavily, irritably. And looked at her.{&1310}\par "You don't get it, Komi. \i You're\i0  going to make it. I'm not. I don't even have a chance." I was shaking my head. "Do you have any idea how that feels? \i No\i0 , you don't," I answered for her. "And nothing you say is going to change anything or make it better."{&1310}\par She stared back with her brown eyes out of her brown face at me. She looked military-crisp and also feminine and confident in herself at the same time in that subtle way the women in uniform I'd seen had. I looked at her and I could already see the officer. The powerful psychokinetic soldier. Her career mapped out in front of her like it'd been etched in lines of fate a long time ago and couldn't have been any different. And what did I see when I looked at myself in the mirror every morning before lights? Nothing. I was blank. I had no future here. I saw that and I was so sure that that was what everyone else saw too that it took me aback for a second the way she touched my arm and spoke to me next.{&1310}\par "Weir," she started. "Evelyn." And she took a collective breath, fixing me with her dark, immaculate eyes. "One, that's not fair. You're comparing yourself to me and that's not fair. It doesn't matter. You get accepted or rejected on your own merits and no one is going to know or care what happened here once you get out and into the fleets. No one - not you, not the other officers, not Lieutenant Morisant. Not your father. No one.{&1310}\par "Two -- you keep beating yourself up like this and you \i will\i0  fail. You will. Finals will come and you will choke because you put so much pressure on doing everything exactly right that you can't let yourself breathe. Or think straight. You're just scared. But ... we all are. I am most of the time. You really aren't doing as badly as you think. I know. I've been here the whole time.{&1310}\par "Three."{&1310}\par She stopped, and if it were possible for that look to get any heavier or more forcefully intent on making sure I understood exactly what she was saying without a single doubt, it did. She squeezed her fingers tight into my arm and made me listen.{&1310}\par "You are going to make it. \i Believe\i0  it. Believe it. Go home and get your head straight. Practice every day until you can clear your mind and you'll find you have it in you. It's genetic. You just need the right atmosphere to open up in. You're father is very powerful. You have something there buried deep down inside you, no matter how small. And you're going to show them that when the time comes. I know you will."{&1310}\par "Okay."{&1310}\par "Yeah? Okay?"{&1310}\par It was hard to escape her and look away, but I did. I was a warring bundle of emotions that couldn't figure out if it was anger, bitterness, frustration, depression, or, maybe, hope that wanted to come out on top. They moved too quickly for me to decide, but there were tears burning in the corners of my eyes. I swiped at them in exaggerated motions with a hand to do something -- anything -- and sniffed.{&1310}\par "Okay."{&1310}\par Komi tried to hug me, and I relented. I don't know if I'd changed my mind yet. I felt too out-of-sorts with myself.{&1310}\par The door chimed, and opened.{&1310}\par "Woah, sorry to break up the love-fest, girls, but-"{&1310}\par "Get the fuck out of here, Hammar," Komi spat almost immediatley with a flash of anger that was startling next to how softly she'd been talking to me just a second before. "What the hell makes you think you can just bust in here like that?"{&1310}\par "Woooaaah," the bigger cadet stuck up a hand. "Door wasn't locked okay?" I pushed back from Komi and quickly looked away while I scrubbed at my eyes. I couldn't help sniffing some more. Komi stood.{&1310}\par "You crying in here?" Hammar frowned and asked, staring past her at me. I put my hands over my face to block him out.{&1310}\par \i God. Fuck. Just stop looking at me.{&1310}\par \i0 "What the hell do you want, Hammar?" Komi was in front of him at the door, blocking most of his view of me. I realized without having noticed it before that someone was standing behind him. Miller. Of course.{&1310}\par "Calm down, Kominshk," Hammar was laughing her anger at him off like it didn't faze him. It probably didn't. When had it ever? "Just wanted to stop by and ask if you had any chance to think about coming out when we get back planetside again --"{&1310}\par "No."{&1310}\par "-- my dad'll be home on leave and he's got this fucking sweet yacht we could go cruising around in for a week or however long we want and --"{&1310}\par "No. No fucking way."{&1310}\par "-- he's already said we can do whatever we want and-- what the fuck! Come on, Kominshk! It'll be -- It'll be \i great\i0 ."{&1310}\par "Why the \i hell \i0 would I even want to do that? With you? I already blew you off once, Hammar. Did you think I didn't mean it or something? Christ!"{&1310}\par "Oh, come on! Just give me a chance, I mean -- we can go out to the Rift and pick up your friend--" he gestured over her shoulder at me "--Mills can come, and he thinks she's kind of cute. Right? Tell her, Mills."{&1310}\par "Well, uh--"{&1310}\par "Yeah, like a double date or something. You know?"{&1310}\par Apparently she didn't know, though, because Komi's only response to that was to abruptly shove the other cadet back out of the way so she could shut the door right in their faces. It whirred closed and I heard Hammar swearing just outside in surprise. Komi stood there, still and staring at it with her fists balled at her sides, for about a minute before she finally turned back around{&1310}\par "Sorry," she apologized. She slumped back against the door, blowing her cheeks out as she sighed. I was mostly re-composed. My eyes were probably a little red, but clear.{&1310}\par "For what?"{&1310}\par She shook her head, barking a laugh at herself while her eyes blinked closed.{&1310}\par "I don't -- I don't even know." {&1310}\par A few seconds more and another sigh that turned into a half sort of bitter laugh. {&1310}\par "Can you believe him?"{&1310}\par I shrugged, not really too worried about it compared to so many other things. {&1310}\par "If it were anyone else, I ... I don't know."{&1310}\par "You mean you \i don't\i0  like 'The Hammer'"?{&1310}\par "Seriously," she laughed it off, "fuck him. \i Seriously\i0 ."{&1310}\par "You're the one he wants," I teased, "not me."{&1310}\par She blinked, and the joke almost got past her. I was the only one who got to see her break down her composure and show some reaction to all the shit that happened outside our bunkroom. She was so careful out there.{&1310}\par "Yeah, well ... sounds like Mills has a thing for \i you\i0  too."{&1310}\par "Probably just hopes to get to you by kissing up to me. Everyone here thinks you're the best."{&1310}\par We were both laughing now. It was nice too, and I did start to feel better.{&1310}\par "You really are the best," I repeated. "You know that?"{&1310}\par Komi's face lit up at that. I didn't expect her to take a compliment from me -- the worst-performing cadet on the whole ship -- as worth much. But the way she smiled and started to blush, you'd think I was Lieutenant Morisant telling her that. Which was weird. Because she opened her mouth to say something and the comm for the room cut her off short.{&1310}\par "Cadet Weir."{&1310}\par Speak of the devil.{&1310}\par Lieutenant Morisant's voice barged in -- cold, calm, and insistent. Somehow I'd summoned him and his attention just by thinking about it. It wasn't even that bad of a joke, really. They said natural psychokinetics with enough power could read people's thoughts as plain as day, and they had a sixth sense about things. Not that I'd met any of them. Even dad never talked about it, so who knew.{&1310}\par But it was then that I realized just who he had called for. And that he had called specifically to our bunkroom. In almost six months -- that had never happened to a cadet. Not once. At least, that I knew of.{&1310}\par So, I froze there on the spot like I'd just been called out to get my ass chewed in front of the whole unit. Like I did far, far too often.{&1310}\par "Cadet Kominshk," the lieutenant continued in a slightly different tone that must have been his version of irritated.{&1310}\par "Aye, sir?"{&1310}\par "Is Cadet Weir asleep?"{&1310}\par "Uh, no, sir, she's-"{&1310}\par "I'm h-here, sir," I cut her off again as quickly as I could. I couldn't keep that tremble out of my voice as I did it, though. God damnit. {&1310}\par Every time.{&1310}\par "Then report to Commander Delacroix's office, cadet. Immediately."{&1310}\par And the comm went dead before either of us could think to say anything more.\cf2\f2 {&1310}\par }{&1310}
