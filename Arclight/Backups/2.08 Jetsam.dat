That's when I felt the fingerbones clawing at my foot.{&1310}\par I spun and kicked without even thinking. Reflex before fear. There had been plenty enough fear already. I connected with the human skull of that body I had been sure was just a corpse but had somehow just grabbed onto my ankle. And the sickening crunch of his breaking neck reverberated through me as it snapped away sideways.{&1310}\par I realized in that instant that the dead man wasn't actually dead. \i Couldn't\i0  have been. But he definitely was now, and with that realization the fear began to catch back up. I'd just killed him. Oh god I'd just \i killed \i0 someo-{&1310}\par Then I also abruptly realized that I hadn't kicked him hard enough to snap his neck. Even worse, his grip on my foot didn't let up even the slightest bit.{&1310}\par My next instinct was to twist free, but it was a bad one. I underestimated his grip. I toppled over instead, and landed hard on my knee. {&1310}\par It clawed its way up my suit's jacket before the pain of bashing my kneecap against the deck could even reach my brain. I finally got a good look at its face then, as it crawled right up my chest.{&1310}\par There was no hair left on his head but a few, lanky strands. The skin was blistering open with black sores in some places and peeling off like some kind of overripe fruit. Veins popped out, black and writhing. They'd broken open and trickled down his neck, painting one side almost completely black.  It looked like his whole skull was trying to burst right out of his face. No eyes, though. I stared down in horror and only black, empty sockets glared back up at me.{&1310}\par It's mouth opened, but that was falling apart too. Filled with black bile and no teeth. It hissed at me -- a wet, gurgling sound. Somehow my fingers found the right button on the wrist controls and my faceplate locked into place instantly.{&1310}\par \i Oh god\i0 !{&1310}\par The knife!{&1310}\par I fell backwards, its dead weight trying to crush me to the floor. One of my hands flung out desperately for the top of the gear locker where I'd left that combat knife while I suited up. And that black, oozing body reached a hand with the skin peeling away around its fingerbones like a skeletal claw right for my face.{&1310}\par I missed the knife. A gloved fingertip brushed the hilt, but that was it. Then I was being crushed flat by the dead thing on top of me.{&1310}\par I grabbed its reaching hand and tried to push it back. I could feel its other one still clawing at me. I think it was trying to rip its way into the suit, and I swear that it was melting into a puddle of putrid, black jelly right on top of me.{&1310}\par I couldn't touch its mouth, even without any teeth. The suit was about to tear open, I could feel it. My forearm was the only thing holding its snapping head back from me, lodged in its sickeningly soft throat. Then it hurled up something out of its mouth, and the faceplate splattered with black sludge.{&1310}\par I couldn't see.{&1310}\par My arms and legs sarted flailing wildly on their own. I bashed and kicked it. I screamed at it. It didn't let go. I could feel it tearing its way into the vacuum-safe suit even as it fell apart.{&1310}\par "... emergency release!"{&1310}\par Someone screamed at me. I heard it dimly over the snarling of that dead thing thrashing on top of me, trying to tear me apart.{&1310}\par "\i What\i0 ??!"{&1310}\par I screamed right back.{&1310}\par There was an image in my head. Another button on the suit's control panel that I'd seen before -- a dozen times, all flashing by in snippets of memory from the academy like sparks of light. I couldn't see it now but I suddenly remembered exactly where it was. The remote emergency release control that instructors had mentioned on the very first field exercises while simultaneously threatening to beat the living shit out of anyone who ever used it. And I hit it.{&1310}\par There was a loud clang. A thud of machinery reverberated through my body like I'd been shot. For a split second, I was sure it wouldn't even work.{&1310}\par Then came the thunder of wind.{&1310}\par \i Wind\i0 .{&1310}\par That thing lifted off me and then came apart as my body leapt into the air.{&1310}\par The outer airlock was open.{&1310}\par My hand flailed one last time and caught something in between the fingers. Then I was catapulted out into the void.{&1310}\par \pard\nowidctlpar\fi720\sl480\slmult1\f1 {&1310}\par \pard\nowidctlpar\sl480\slmult1\qc\f2\fs20 *\tab *\tab *\f1\fs22 {&1310}\par \pard\fi720\sl480\slmult1\f0 {&1310}\par Dad's quarters felt smaller since the last time I'd been in them. That had been about a week before I left for the academy -- not even a year ago. And it wasn't like I was a little kid anymore or anything so I hadn't just grown suddenly somehow between then and now. I'm pretty sure someone would've made some kind of philosophical quip about become an adult and then coming back home if I'd been thinking that out loud.{&1310}\par I looked around and realized he'd stuffed the place even more full of things than before. Extra computer terminals, sample micro-storage units, piles of old physical texts and anonymous machines slapped together by lab techs. A lot of stuff he must have brought home from the labs to tinker with or on. Whether he was actually allowed to do that according to station and military regs probably didn't even matter.{&1310}\par I'd moved out about five years ago, when I'd turned eighteen, and gotten assigned my own, much smaller apartment that was little more than a closet. Well, "moved out" was probably putting it generously. More like "kicked out" since it hadn't really been my idea, like some other military brats on the station. No, dad had insisted and gone ahead and arranged for most of it to just happen -- without me being apart of much except the move. I'd just come home one day to find my room somewhere else on the station -- the other \i side\i0  of the station even. And it hadn't taken him too long to start filling my old room up with extra work. {&1310}\par I'd been pretty bitter about that. But I'd gotten over it.{&1310}\par Retired Rear Admiral Nolan Weir might have been the only officer in the Five Fleets that didn't understand the meaning of the word "retired". Tess liked to joke about it -- that some top brass had gotten dad discharged just so he could spend more time on his work. Who knew? He never talked about it with anyone. Well, not with me, at least.{&1310}\par This place didn't feel like home anymore. These were just Doctor Nolan Weir's personal quarters -- his lab away from the labs -- and I hadn't spent much time there after I'd been relocated elsewhere. Sometimes I'd wondered if he would've even noticed if I hadn't shown up to see him for lunch, like we did once a week until right before I left. But then -- I kind of got an answer when he never returned any of my messages the whole time I was at basic.{&1310}\par That bitterness ... I hadn't gotten over. {&1310}\par Yet.{&1310}\par Mills followed in dutifully behind me -- far more in awe than I could have ever been. And why not? He'd probably never been inside an admiral's personal quarters before. Even a retired one's. Or it could've just been that apparently common belief that retired Rear Admiral Nolan Weir was one of the most powerful psychokinetics in the sector. That was probably pretty awe-inspiring.{&1310}\par The man himself was somewhat less so just then, however -- sitting there at one of his scattered data analysis terminals, sucking down old coffee and looking like he hadn't moved from that spot or slept in days.{&1310}\par Pity overwhelmed me of a sudden at that sight of him. Cold anger and hurt had been festering for so long against him as a disembodied asshole too self-important to remember that -- oh, yeah -- he'd sent his own daughter away to be brainwashed by the Grand Admirals. And now he was here. In the flesh. For a moment, all I could see was a very old man ... very tired, and so very alone. {&1310}\par My imagination painted him happy and handsome and uncomplicated when my mother had been alive. Before I had come along. Before she'd died giving birth, which wouldn't have happened at all had they not been stranded away from civilized space when that time finally came.{&1310}\par For a moment, I frowned sadly at him and my resolve cracked -- overwhelmed with relief and something like happiness just to see dad again after so long.{&1310}\par Who else cared? Who else cared about him outside of whatever he did for the Grand Admirals' Five Fleets? No one, probably. No one except me now.{&1310}\par Then he opened his mouth.{&1310}\par "Just another minute, I'm almost done."{&1310}\par My pity waned with time. Time that he let stretch out. {&1310}\par One minute turned to two, two to five, five to ten. I folded my arms across my chest, waiting and feeling all that hurt and frustration come seeping back in seductively from the sides. I fought it. I tried not to feel that way. I really did.{&1310}\par Mills just stood there, obediently. I don't think he could have questioned that haggard-looking old man in his soiled clothes sitting there, oblivious to all the rest of the world, even if he'd wanted to. He probably would have stood there silently all day. Maybe until he starved to death on a diet of just decorum. Just ... waiting.{&1310}\par And now I was realizing that I really could never go back to the academy. I didn't belong there. I wasn't like dad or Mills or Komi or ...{&1310}\par I just ... \i didn't\i0  have it in me.{&1310}\par I slumped.{&1310}\par How could I ever tell him that?{&1310}\par "You never wrote back," I started, finally. I tried to, anyways. I could feel tears burning at the corners of my eyes as soon as I opened my mouth and I drowned them in sheer force of will to keep back out of sight.{&1310}\par For another few, long moments, he didn't even seem to notice except for a delayed raising of one finger that just meant for me to keep waiting. I began to silently wonder if he would ever finish whatever he was so busy working on at \i all\i0 . Then I felt something hot and wet slide down the side of one cheek.{&1310}\par I swiped at the side of my face.{&1310}\par I looked up at the rivets on the ceiling plates. I bit my lip. I didn't blink. {&1310}\par I wasn't going to cry. Not in front of dad. Not in front of Mills either. Not after everything I'd been through.{&1310}\par "I said, you never wrote back," I tried again, this time my voice breaking just a little that I couldn't help. Another tear on the other side of my face and I swatted at that one too.{&1310}\par I don't know why I'd thought this would have gone differently. That he could've never been bothered to talk to me while I was away should have been warning enough. He'd been steeping himself in so much work before I'd even left that now he was completely and utterly buried in it. He probably hadn't stopped to even \i listen \i0 to any of my messages in the first place.{&1310}\par I scrubbed at my eyes with the heels of both palms as covertly as I could. Which wasn't much, but I did it fast and no one was paying much attention to me anyways.{&1310}\par I wished I'd never brought Mills along. I wished I'd never even come in here at all.{&1310}\par "Dad ..." I started again, and he abruptly looked up at me then.{&1310}\par "Evelyn," he said, and frowned, as if realizing for the first time that I was even here. Maybe he was, even though he'd had the presence of mind to know that I was there and to invite me inside. It was a vain hope to think he'd beene expecting and waiting for me. He'd probably just sensed our presence and wouldn't have been rude enough to turn me away. But I was a distraction. {&1310}\par I just shrugged my shoulders and flipped both my hands out as if to say, "Well, I'm here," now that he was finally looking. I didn't trust my voice anymore.{&1310}\par "Sorry," he apologized mechanically, glancing at the unit on his wrist. "I don't mean to keep you waiting. You probably have a lot of things you want to do while you're home again." He was preoccupied still and seemed almost flustered. "I was -- \i am\i0  ... finishing something," he explained.{&1310}\par "Do you," I tried, but could barely more than manage a croak in my throat. I had to swallow hard to get anymore. {&1310}\par "Do you want me to come back?" I managed to ask, but my voice still cracked as I did. "When you're not busy?" I tried to ignore that wetness staining my cheeks.{&1310}\par He looked around at his work again. He looked at me. I could see him considering it. Considering whether to turn me away the first time he'd spoken to or seen me in six months. {&1310}\par I could come back. I had time. {&1310}\par But I didn't want to go and come back. Why had I even offered?{&1310}\par Those few seconds while his head turned in thought felt like the longest in my entire life for some reason.{&1310}\par "A few hours," he finally said, and there was a delayed reaction on my part where my brain just refused to understand what I had already known was coming as soon as I opened my big, fat mouth. "Just a few more hours and I'll be done. We can talk then. We still have time."{&1310}\par The last bit he mumbled almost to himself like he didn't trust it out loud, but my heart had already started its short descent to the deck. I nodded my head without even realizing it. I'd already started turning away. {&1310}\par Mills just stood there, dumbfounded and looking quickly between the two of us. He could have tried his luck without me. Who knows? Maybe he would have gotten even more than I did. Other people who weren't me probably did.{&1310}\par His courage waned, though, and he was dragging his heels behind me by the time I reached the door again. Dad hadn't even noticed him.{&1310}\par I hesitated for a second. Just a second.{&1310}\par The door opened, but I looked back. Dad had gone back to work. His head was bent down over that terminal once more and he was swiping furiously at it while scowling to no one.{&1310}\par He didn't even watch me go.{&1310}\par I got outside and the sound of the door rushing closed behind me didn't fade. It got louder in my ears until I realized it was the blood thumping in my veins. I felt dizzy and sick, but mostly I just felt terrible and I didn't know why. I shouldn't have expected anything. I shouldn't have expected anything \i more\i0 .{&1310}\par I didn't even bother fighting back any of the tears streaming down my face by now.{&1310}\par "What ..." Mills started, coming up behind me. He still had that dumbstruck look on his face. "What ha- ... \i happened\i0 ," he stammered. His decorum had broken down almost completely now and the shock and stunned disappointment was plain to see. He hadn't gotten to meet the man he'd been so desperately excited to see. The man who didn't even have enough time for his own daughter.{&1310}\par "Hey!"{&1310}\par I had my back to him and didn't look. He tried to grab a hold of me but I broke free roughly and shook him off.{&1310}\par "Are you okay?" he asked.{&1310}\par No. {&1310}\par No. I wasn't. {&1310}\par But I wasn't about to tell him anything about that.{&1310}\par I tore away into the corridor, accidentally bowling over a drunk junior grade lieutenant who went over in a heap far more easily than he should have. I didn't stop to hear what the two other officers with him shouted at me either. {&1310}\par I just ran away from anyone.\cf2\f3 {&1310}\par }{&1310}

I didn't trust my voice anymore.{&1310}\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "Sorry," he apologized mechanically, glancing at the unit on his wrist. "I don't mean to keep you waiting.

I tried to ignore that wetness staining my cheeks.{&1310}\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 He looked around at his work again. He looked at me. I could see him considering it.

It got louder in my ears until I realized it was the blood thumping in my veins. I felt dizzy and sick, but mostly I just felt terrible and I didn't know why. I shouldn't have expected anything.

That wasn't even a year ago and I wasn't a little kid anymore so it wasn't like I'd grown suddenly between then and now. I looked around and realized he'd stuffed the place even more full of things he must have brought home from the labs to tinker with. <list of things> Whether he was actually allowed to do that according to station and military regs probably didn't even matter.{&1310}\par I'd moved out about five years ago, when I'd turned eighteen, and gotten assigned my own, much smaller apartment that was little more than a closet. It hadn't really been my idea, though, like some other military brats on the station. No, dad had insisted and gone ahead and arranged for most of it to just happen -- without me being apart of much except the move. I'd just come home one day to find my room somewhere else on the station -- the other \i side\i0  of the station. And he'd started filling up my old room with extra work stuff before I'd even gotten resettled.{&1310}\par I'd been pretty bitter about that. But I'd gotten over it too.{&1310}\par This didn't feel like home anymore. These were just Doctor Nolan Weir's personal quarters -- his lab away from the labs -- and I hadn't spent much time there up until I'd left. Sometimes I'd wondered if he would've even noticed if I hadn't shown up to see him for lunch, like we did once a week until I'd left. But then -- I kind of got an answer when he never returned any of my messages the whole time I was at basic.{&1310}\par That bitterness ... I hadn't gotten over. Yet.{&1310}\par Mills followed in dutifully behind me -- far more in awe than I could have ever been. And why not? He'd probably never been inside an admiral's personal quarters before, or even a retired one's. Or it could've just been the commonly-held belief that retired Rear Admiral Nolan Weir was one of the most powerful psychokinetics in the sector. That was probably pretty awe-inspiring.{&1310}\par The man himself was somewhat less so just then however -- sitting there at one of his many scattered terminals, sucking down old coffee and looking like he hadn't moved from that spot to sleep in days.{&1310}\par Pity overwhelmed me of a sudden at that sight of him, washing away that cold anger and hurt that had been festering for so long. For a moment, all I saw was a very old man, very tired and so very alone. My imagination painted him happy and handsome and uncomplicated when my mother had been alive. Before I had come along. Before she'd died giving birth, which wouldn't have happened at all had they not been stranded away from civilized space when that time finally came.{&1310}\par For a moment, I frowned sadly at him and my resolve cracked -- overwhelmed with relief and something like happiness just to see dad again after so long.{&1310}\par Then he opened his mouth.{&1310}\par "Just another minute, I'm almost done."{&1310}\par My pity waned. One minute turned to two, two to five, five to ten. I folded my arms across my chest, waiting and feeling all that hurt and frustration come seeping back in from the sides. I fought it. I tried not to feel that way.{&1310}\par Mills just stood there, obediently. I don't think he could have questioned that haggard-looking old man in his soiled clothes sitting there, oblivious to all the rest of the world, even if he'd wanted to. He probably would have stood there silently all day. Maybe until he starved to death on a diet of just decorum. Just ... waiting.{&1310}\par And now I was realizing that I really could never go back to the academy. I didn't belong there. I just ... \i didn't\i0  have it in me.{&1310}\par I slumped.{&1310}\par "You never wrote back," I said, finally. I could feel tears burning at the corners o my eyes as soon as I opened my mouth and I drowned them in sheer force of will to keep back out of sight.{&1310}\par For another few, long moments, he didn't even notice. I began to wonder if he would at all, and I felt something hot and wet slide down the side of one cheek.{&1310}\par \i Fuck!\i0  I slapped at the side of my face.{&1310}\par I wasn't going to cry. Not in front of dad. Not in front of Mills. Not after everything I'd been through.{&1310}\par "I said you never wrote back," I tried again, this time my voice breaking just a little that I couldn't stop. Another tear on the other side of my face and I swatted at that one too.{&1310}\par I don't know why I'd thought this would have gone differently. That he'd never talked to me while I was away should have warned me enough. He'd been steeping himself in so much work before I'd even left and now he was completely buried. He probably hadn't even bothered to listen to any of my messages in the first place.{&1310}\par I wished I'd never brought Mills along. I wished I'd never even come in here at all.{&1310}\par "Dad ..." I started again, and he abruptly looked up at me then.{&1310}\par "Evelyn," he said, and frowned, as if realizing for the first time that I was even here. Maybe he was, even though he'd had the presence of mind to know that I was there and to invite me inside. It was a vain hope to think he'd beene expecting and waiting for me. He'd probably just sensed our presence and wouldn't have been rude enough to turn me away. But I was a distraction. {&1310}\par I just shrugged my shoulders and flipped both my hands out as if to say, "Well, I'm here," now that he was finally looking. I didn't trust my voice anymore.{&1310}\par "Sorry," he apologized mechanically, glancing at his wrist. "I didn't  mean to keep you waiting there so long. I was -- \i am\i0  ... finishing something."{&1310}\par "Do you," I tried, but could barely more than manage a croak in my throat. "Do you want me to come back?" I managed to asked, my voice cracking as I did. "When you're not busy?" I tried to ignore that wetness staining my cheeks.\cf2\f3 {&1310}\par }{&1310}

One minute turned to two, two to five, five to ten. I folded my arms across my chest, waiting and feeling all that hurt and frustration come seeping back in from the sides. I fought it. I tried not to feel that way.{&1310}\par Mills just stood there, obediently. I don't think he could have questioned that haggard-looking old man in his soiled clothes sitting there, oblivious to all the rest of the world, even if he'd wanted to. He probably would have stood there silently all day. Maybe until he starved to death on a diet of just decorum. Just ... waiting.{&1310}\par And now I was realizing that I really could never go back to the academy. I didn't belong there. I just ... \i didn't\i0  have it in me.{&1310}\par I slumped.{&1310}\par "You never wrote back," I said, finally. I could feel tears burning at the corners o my eyes as soon as I opened my mouth and I drowned them in sheer force of will to keep back out of sight.{&1310}\par For another few, long moments, he didn't even notice. I began to wonder if he would at all, and I felt something hot and wet slide down the side of one cheek.{&1310}\par \i Fuck!\i0  I slapped at the side of my face.{&1310}\par I wasn't going to cry. Not in front of dad. Not in front of Mills. Not after everything I'd been through.{&1310}\par "I said you never wrote back," I tried again, this time my voice breaking just a little that I couldn't stop. Another tear on the other side of my face and I swatted at that one too.{&1310}\par I don't know why I'd thought this would have gone differently. That he'd never talked to me while I was away should have warned me enough. He'd been steeping himself in so much work before I'd even left and now he was completely buried. He probably hadn't even bothered to listen to any of my messages in the first place.{&1310}\par I wished I'd never brought Mills along. I wished I'd never even come in here at all.{&1310}\par "Dad ..." I started again, and he abruptly looked up at me then.{&1310}\par "Evelyn," he said, and frowned, as if realizing for the first time that I was even here. Maybe he was, even though he'd had the presence of mind to know that I was there and to invite me inside. It was a vain hope to think he'd beene expecting and waiting for me. He'd probably just sensed our presence and wouldn't have been rude enough to turn me away. But I was a distraction. {&1310}\par I just shrugged my shoulders and flipped both my hands out as if to say, "Well, I'm here," now that he was finally looking. I didn't trust my voice anymore.{&1310}\par "Sorry," he apologized mechanically, glancing at his wrist. "I didn't  mean to keep you waiting there so long. I was -- \i am\i0  ... finishing something."{&1310}\par "Do you," I tried, but could barely more than manage a croak in my throat. "Do you want me to come back?" I managed to asked, my voice cracking as I did. "When you're not busy?" I tried to ignore that wetness staining my cheeks.{&1310}\par He looked around at his work. He looked at me. I could see him considering it. Considering whether to turn me away the first time he'd spoken to or seen me in six months. I could come back. I had time. But I didn't want to go and come back. Why had I even offered?{&1310}\par Those few seconds while his head turned in thought felt like the longest in my entire life for some reason.{&1310}\par "A few hours," he finally said, and there was a delayed reaction on my part where my brain refused to understand. "Just a few more hours and I'll be done. We can talk then. We still have time."{&1310}\par The last bit he mumbled almost to himself like he didn't trust it out loud, but my heard had already dropped through the deck at that point. I nodded my head without even realizing it. I'd already started turning away. Mills just stood there, dumbfounded and looking quickly between the two of us. His courage waned, though, and he was on my heels dagging his by the time I reached the door again. Dad hadn't even noticed him.{&1310}\par I hesitated for a second. Just a second.{&1310}\par The door opened, but I looked back. Dad had gone back to work. His head was bent down over that terminal once more and he was swiping furiously at it while scowling to no one.{&1310}\par He didn't even watch me go.{&1310}\par I got outside and the sound of the door rushing closed behind me didn't fade. It got louder in my ears until I realized it was the blood thumping in my veins. I felt dizzy and sick, but mostly I just felt terrible and I didn't know why. I shouldn't have expected anything. I shouldn't have expected anything more.{&1310}\par I didn't even bother fighting back any of the tears streaming down my face by now.{&1310}\par "What ..." Mills started, coming up behind me. He still had that dumbstruck look on his face. "What ha- ... \i happened\i0 ," he stammered. His decorum had broken down almost completely now and the shock and stunned disappointment was plain to see. He hadn't got to meet the man who'd been too busy for even his own daughter.{&1310}\par "Hey!"{&1310}\par I had my back to him and didn't look. He tried to grab a hold of me but I broke free roughly and shook him off.{&1310}\par "Are you okay?" he asked.{&1310}\par No. {&1310}\par No. I wasn't. {&1310}\par But I wasn't about to tell him anything about that.{&1310}\par I tore away into the corridor, accidentally bowling over a drunk junior grade lieutenant who went over in a heap far more easily than he should have. I didn't stop to hear what the two other officers with him shouted at me either. {&1310}\par I just ran away from anyone.\cf2\f3 {&1310}\par }{&1310}

That's when I felt the fingerbones clawing at my foot.{&1310}\par I spun and kicked without even thinking. Reflex before fear. There had been plenty enough fear already. I connected with the human skull of that body I had been sure was just a corpse but had somehow not. And the sickening crunch of his breaking neck reverberated through me as it snapped away sideways.{&1310}\par I realized in that instant that the dead man wasn't actually dead. \i Couldn't\i0  have been. But he definitely was now, and with that realization the fear began to catch back up. But then I also realized I hadn't kicked him hard enough to snap his neck. Even worse, his grip on my foot didn't let up even the slightest bit.{&1310}\par My next instinct was to twist free, but I underestimated his grip. Instead I toppled over, and landed hard on my knee. {&1310}\par It clawed its way up my suit's jacket before the pain of bashing my kneecap against the deck could even reach my brain. I finally got a good look at its face then, as it crawled right up my chest.{&1310}\par There was no hair left on his head but a few, lanky strands. The skin was blistering open with black sores in some places and peeling off like some kind of overripe fruit. Veins popped out, black and writhing. They'd broken open and trickled down his neck, painting one side almost completely black.  It looked like his whole skull was trying to burst right out of his face. No eyes, though. I stared down in horror and only black, empty sockets glared back up at me.{&1310}\par It's mouth opened, but that was falling apart too. Filled with black bile and no teeth. It hissed at me -- a wet, gurgling sound. Somehow my fingers found the right button on the wrist controls and my faceplate locked into place instantly.{&1310}\par The knife!{&1310}\par I fell back over, dead weight trying to crush me to the floor. One hand flung out for the top of that gear locker where I'd put the combat knife down while I suited up. At the same time, that gargling body reached a claw-like hand that was coming apart into black ooze for my face.{&1310}\par I missed the knife. A gloved fingertip brushed the hilt, but that was it. Then I was being crushed flat by the dead thing on top of me.{&1310}\par I grabbed its reaching hand and tried to push it back. I could feel its other one still clawing at me. I think it was trying to rip its way into the suit, and I swear that it was melting into a puddle of putrid, black jelly right on top of me.{&1310}\par I couldn't touch its mouth, even without any teeth. The suit was about to tear open, I could feel it. My forearm was the only thing holding its snapping head back from me, lodged in its sickeningly soft throat. Then it hurled up something out of its mouth, and the faceplate splattered with black sludge.{&1310}\par I couldn't see.{&1310}\par My arms and legs sarted flailing wildly on their own. I bashed and kicked it. I screamed at it. It didn't let go. I could feel it tearing its way into the vacuum-safe suit even as it fell apart.{&1310}\par "... emergency release!"{&1310}\par Someone screamed at me. I heard it dimly over the snarling of that dead thing thrashing on top of me, trying to tear me apart.{&1310}\par "\i What\i0 ??!"{&1310}\par I screamed right back.{&1310}\par There was an image in my head. Another button on the suit's control panel that I'd seen before -- a dozen times, all flashing by in snippets of memory from the academy like sparks of light. I couldn't see it now but I suddenly remembered exactly where it was. The remote emergency release control that instructors had mentioned on the very first field exercises while simultaneously threatening to beat the living shit out of anyone who ever used it. And I hit it.{&1310}\par There was a loud clang. A thud of machinery reverberated through my body like I'd been shot. For a split second, I was sure it wouldn't even work.{&1310}\par Then came the thunder of wind.{&1310}\par \i Wind\i0 .{&1310}\par That thing lifted off me and then came apart as my body leapt into the air.{&1310}\par The outer airlock was open.{&1310}\par My hand flailed one last time and caught something in between the fingers. Then I was catapulted out into the void.{&1310}\par \pard\nowidctlpar\fi720\sl480\slmult1\f1 {&1310}\par \pard\nowidctlpar\sl480\slmult1\qc\f2\fs20 *\tab *\tab *\f1\fs22 {&1310}\par \pard\fi720\sl480\slmult1\f0 {&1310}\par Dad's quarters felt smaller since the last time I'd been in them. That had been about a week before I left for the academy -- not even a year ago. And it wasn't like I was a little kid anymore or anything so I hadn't just grown suddenly somehow between then and now. I'm pretty sure someone would've made some kind of philosophical quip about become an adult and then coming back home if I'd been thinking that out loud.{&1310}\par I looked around and realized he'd stuffed the place even more full of things than before. Extra computer terminals, sample micro-storage units, piles of old physical texts and anonymous machines slapped together by lab techs. A lot of stuff he must have brought home from the labs to tinker with or on. Whether he was actually allowed to do that according to station and military regs probably didn't even matter.{&1310}\par I'd moved out about five years ago, when I'd turned eighteen, and gotten assigned my own, much smaller apartment that was little more than a closet. Well, "moved out" was probably putting it generously. More like "kicked out" since it hadn't really been my idea, like some other military brats on the station. No, dad had insisted and gone ahead and arranged for most of it to just happen -- without me being apart of much except the move. I'd just come home one day to find my room somewhere else on the station -- the other \i side\i0  of the station even. And it hadn't taken him too long to start filling my old room up with extra work. {&1310}\par I'd been pretty bitter about that. But I'd gotten over it.{&1310}\par Retired Rear Admiral Nolan Weir might have been the only officer in the Five Fleets that didn't understand the meaning of the word "retired". Tess liked to joke about it -- that some top brass had gotten dad discharged just so he could spend more time on his work. Who knew? He never talked about it with anyone. Well, not with me, at least.{&1310}\par This place didn't feel like home anymore. These were just Doctor Nolan Weir's personal quarters -- his lab away from the labs -- and I hadn't spent much time there after I'd been relocated elsewhere. Sometimes I'd wondered if he would've even noticed if I hadn't shown up to see him for lunch, like we did once a week until right before I left. But then -- I kind of got an answer when he never returned any of my messages the whole time I was at basic.{&1310}\par That bitterness ... I hadn't gotten over. {&1310}\par Yet.{&1310}\par Mills followed in dutifully behind me -- far more in awe than I could have ever been. And why not? He'd probably never been inside an admiral's personal quarters before. Even a retired one's. Or it could've just been that apparently common belief that retired Rear Admiral Nolan Weir was one of the most powerful psychokinetics in the sector. That was probably pretty awe-inspiring.{&1310}\par The man himself was somewhat less so just then, however -- sitting there at one of his scattered data analysis terminals, sucking down old coffee and looking like he hadn't moved from that spot or slept in days.{&1310}\par Pity overwhelmed me of a sudden at that sight of him. Cold anger and hurt had been festering for so long against him as a disembodied asshole too self-important to remember that -- oh, yeah -- he'd sent his own daughter away to be brainwashed by the Grand Admirals. And now he was here. In the flesh. For a moment, all I could see was a very old man ... very tired, and so very alone. {&1310}\par My imagination painted him happy and handsome and uncomplicated when my mother had been alive. Before I had come along. Before she'd died giving birth, which wouldn't have happened at all had they not been stranded away from civilized space when that time finally came.{&1310}\par For a moment, I frowned sadly at him and my resolve cracked -- overwhelmed with relief and something like happiness just to see dad again after so long.{&1310}\par Who else cared? Who else cared about him outside of whatever he did for the Grand Admirals' Five Fleets? No one, probably. No one except me now.{&1310}\par Then he opened his mouth.{&1310}\par "Just another minute, I'm almost done."{&1310}\par My pity waned with time. Time that he let stretch out. {&1310}\par One minute turned to two, two to five, five to ten. I folded my arms across my chest, waiting and feeling all that hurt and frustration come seeping back in seductively from the sides. I fought it. I tried not to feel that way. I really did.{&1310}\par Mills just stood there, obediently. I don't think he could have questioned that haggard-looking old man in his soiled clothes sitting there, oblivious to all the rest of the world, even if he'd wanted to. He probably would have stood there silently all day. Maybe until he starved to death on a diet of just decorum. Just ... waiting.{&1310}\par And now I was realizing that I really could never go back to the academy. I didn't belong there. I wasn't like dad or Mills or Komi or ...{&1310}\par I just ... \i didn't\i0  have it in me.{&1310}\par I slumped.{&1310}\par How could I ever tell him that?{&1310}\par "You never wrote back," I started, finally. I tried to, anyways. I could feel tears burning at the corners of my eyes as soon as I opened my mouth and I drowned them in sheer force of will to keep back out of sight.{&1310}\par For another few, long moments, he didn't even seem to notice except for a delayed raising of one finger that just meant for me to keep waiting. I began to silently wonder if he would ever finish whatever he was so busy with at all. Then I felt something hot and wet slide down the side of one cheek.{&1310}\par \i Fuck!\i0  I slapped at the side of my face.{&1310}\par I wasn't going to cry. Not in front of dad. Not in front of Mills either. Not after everything I'd been through.{&1310}\par "I said, you never wrote back," I tried again, this time my voice breaking just a little that I couldn't help.

He'd been steeping himself in so much work before I'd even left that now he was completely and utterly buried in it. He probably hadn't stopped to even \i listen \i0 to any of my messages in the first place.{&1310}\par I scrubbed at my eyes with the heels of both palms as covertly as I could. I wished I'd never brought Mills along. I wished I'd never even come in here at all.{&1310}\par "Dad ..." I started again, and he abruptly looked up at me then.{&1310}\par "Evelyn," he said, and frowned, as if realizing for the first time that I was even here.

"I was -- \i am\i0  ... finishing something," he explained.{&1310}\par "Do you," I tried, but could barely more than manage a croak in my throat. I had to swallow hard to get anymore. {&1310}\par "Do you want me to come back?" I managed to ask, but my voice still cracked as I did. "When you're not busy?"

"Just a few more hours and I'll be done. We can talk then. We still have time."{&1310}\par The last bit he mumbled almost to himself like he didn't trust it out loud, but my heart had already started its short descent to the deck. I nodded my head without even realizing it. I'd already started turning away. {&1310}\par Mills just stood there, dumbfounded and looking quickly between the two of us. He could have tried his luck without me. Who knows? Maybe he would have gotten even more than I did. Other people who weren't me probably did.{&1310}\par His courage waned, though, and he was dragging his heels behind me by the time I reached the door again.
