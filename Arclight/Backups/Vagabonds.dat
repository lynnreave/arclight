Slow, and then fast. I stared down at my feet - looked up, and an hour had passed. Landmarks had already faded behind. Then seconds would crawl by so slowly that I thought they'd choke the life out of me. The air felt thick, and heavy, and never stopped moving. It made it hard to catch a breath.{&1310}\par "Are you okay?" Tess tugged at my elbow somewhere along the bleak way of rocky hills sprouting up and leaving those less bumpy flatlands behind. I jerked at the touch without realizing it, forgetting again that she was even there and real. I managed to ask her as much while the nerve took me.{&1310}\par "I kinda followed you," she mumbled abashedly sometime later. We were trudgin beside that stony bluff Julian had said the train tunnel ran right through. So strange.{&1310}\par "I hid in one of the storage closets for two days. Just, uh ... don't ask me how I got to the toilet. You know Old Weir-do never sleeps."{&1310}\par "He never did."{&1310}\par Tess laughed it off, but I could tell her heart just wasn't in it either. I almost wished that I could even fake it like she did, but the thought still cut too deep.{&1310}\par She decided to tell me all about Julian to change the subject fast. She called him Jules, but I could tell he hated that. Eluvian - was what she said he was. I hadn't seen it, though I could see it in his profile and features now. Tall, and well-proportioned. Handsome in a timeless sort of way, even through the harshness and grime.{&1310}\par "I don't think they're supposed ta be carrying around guns, fighting monsters on some moon in the middle of nowhere, though," she mused aloud. "I think he was hunting pirates. Or something ..."{&1310}\par She'd always been into those things more than me, reading and watching everything she could get her hands on. And I guess it was hard for her to bury all that excitement in thinking about what had happened. She had wanted to get away from Riftwatch even more than me. It was probably why she had snuck along in the first place. Too bad Dad had ...{&1310}\par "Why is he here?" I asked her. Stuck there on that moon running for his life seemed like the last place anyone should have wanted to be. And he didn't know us at all.{&1310}\par "Here?" She blinked. "You mean - with us? Oh, he wouldn't be if he didn't have to," she whispered to me behind a hand, giving the Eluvian a furtive glance ahead where he was setting our breakneck marching pace. "I think. He tried to leave us behind a couple times anyways."{&1310}\par She didn't really explain that. But I had seen him take a swing at her back at the station, so I knew he wasn't all good. Still, I had seen him nearly get himself killed putting himself between us and that thing back on the train too.{&1310}\par "Do you know what that ... it was?" Tess eventually asked at some point. I had just tried to forget it since the whispering had stopped. Moved on, maybe. Either way, I shook my head.{&1310}\par "I saw something like it," I managed. And swallowed down the bile in my throat. "Back on the transport ship. Lots of them."{&1310}\par Tess' face blanched at that, and I gave her a sidelong look. {&1310}\par We slowed enough a little while later for her to catch up and ask Julian what it was, but his answer was even less heartening.{&1310}\par "No," he grunted back at her, keeping his rifle low and to the dirt as he moved. "But it didn't belong here."{&1310}\par "What the hell's that supposed to mean?"{&1310}\par He didn't answer her for a time, preoccupied with everything else around him. I listened in just the same when he did finally open his mouth again.{&1310}\par "I could just feel it," he continued in a low, absent voice. "Like a nail scratching on steel," he mused, almost uncharactistically of him - from what I had seen. Then he just repeated himself. {&1310}\par "It didn't belong here."{&1310}\par And that was as much as she got out of him. It reminded me a little of how Dad had sounded before we ran off into that man and he-{&1310}\par I don't know how long we walked. Everything dimmed as that planet in the sky dipped down toward the horizon. I saw stars in empty space, but the formations weren't familiar anymore. The air was thick, moist, and made my tongue taste like twigs and weeds. It made me dizzy sometimes. Tess, too, I could tell. But Julian kept on hard.{&1310}\par I was tired when he finally stopped again. Tess looked much worse. Not that it mattered. Wherever we were going - we were finally there.{&1310}\par The tunnel must have ended, because tracks came shooting out of the ground beside us and throat a gate off into the distance.{&1310}\par "Is that the space port?"{&1310}\par It was Tess who asked. Flagging and hunched over, with her arms flopping listlessly at her sides, she managed to throw one that way and cough a few words out. Julian just shook his head.{&1310}\par "No."{&1310}\par "What the ... hell ..." Tess huffed back at him, twisting her head around forlornly. "So what \i is\i0  it then?"{&1310}\par It was a step up from the washed-out town we left behind. A lot of long, squat, and port-less buildings with large doors. Too large for people. Further on there were some different kinds clustered at the middle of it all, looking packed-in but much more live-able. A huge tower stretched up from the middle of them into the sky there. I lost the top of it in the clouds.{&1310}\par "That will go to the port," Julian said, canting his head toward the tower.{&1310}\par It was more for himself than us, though. Some reassurance. Because he started down toward that place without another word. Tess just groaned, and stumbled after.\cf2\f2 {&1310}\par }{&1310}
