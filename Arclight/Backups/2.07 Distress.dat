Honestly, I really didn't know what else to do. I thought about it. In fits. Stalking about the burnt-out clearing around the shuttle while I stressed over other things. But I had never had to deal with anything like that before, and anything I had read or watched that included people bleeding like that usually had some doctor around to fix them up. Or they, well ... died.{&1310}\par Ev wasn't dying, though. I kept telling myself that as I stomped around chewing on various fingernails. Eventually I found my headphones in the shuttle and put those on to full. It helped drown out some of the worries while I rooted around some more for something else that might help.

So I sat down with the small device in front of me in the dirt and started to put it together. Pretty soon, I had a working beacon with its own little red light blinking on the side that the instructions said meant it was transmitting. Maybe someone would even find us before too long. I could hope. Other than that, all there was to do was ... well, wait.{&1310}\par It was several hours until nightfall - something that had consisted simply of a timed alarm and the flicking of a light switch to "off" for my entire life. The real thing was a little more unsettling than I would have thought. That general yellowish-white wash over everything under the sun quickly grew dull and dimmed to a bluish black. Space was almost always dark. But it was something entirely different planetside. Dark things always came out in the dark - go figure. At least in anything scary I had ever watched or read. And all of those things popped back into my head while I watched the sun go down over the distant horizon. I started to get a little paranoid, I have to admit.{&1310}\par Bringing Ev inside the shuttle seemed like a good idea when I started to think about it getting dark and having to sleep outside. I had not dared leave the other woman out of sight the whole time she lay there near-death. Eventually, I just had to drag and slide her around and through the broken rear hatch door. It was full-on night by then, but I got us both inside and found the emergency rations. And I tore into those with a fury despite how bad they tasted before falling into a fitful half-sleep for most of the night.{&1310}\par If I had thought to be skinned and ripped apart or eaten in the middle of my first night on a planet, I was pretty disappointed. I made it through all right, but it was hard to tell if Ev had improved any the next morning. She didn't seem like she moved much all night. And it took a few for me to get over my own stiff and aching parts from the crash. My shoulder, especially, was killing me. Dragging a body through the woods didn't help much either. I had to massage it for almost fifteen minutes before I could even get up. Ev still looked pale.{&1310}\par There was enough rations and water stored on board the shuttle for a little while, and I was pretty generous with spilling it all over Ev's face while trying to get something down her throat. The other woman choked up a lot, and I freaked out a few times, thinking that I was drowning her. She was still sweating and weak, and I could hardly leave her side. But that didn't stop me from seeing my first sunrise on that planet.{&1310}\par An hour had almost gone by before I realized I had just been standing there, staring into the horizon. I snapped back to, but the sight stayed with me. I was sure I had never seen anything so beautiful before in my life. And I could almost get mad at Nolan for ruining the whole thing for me by dying.{&1310}\par That sent me off feeling guilty and terrible. I kicked around for a while after that, not sure just what I could do and poking my head in on Ev every so often. An unconscious woman wasn't much good for conversation, though, so I was left to either thinking apologetically to myself or talking out loud to no one. I got distracted by some birds flying about the tops of trees and the cacophony of caws and calls from hidden animals in the forest. It was deafening compared to Riftwatch. And, here, there were no people. It was gusting a little less today too, but not by much.{&1310}\par At some point, I got the idea to check on Nolan and the second life pod. I was restless, and one of the only things on that planet not moving. The pod wasn't far from where the shuttle had crashed, but still I broke out in an anxious fit thinking about something happening to Ev while I was gone. My legs still seemed to work well enough, even if my arm was tender. Eventually, I worked up the courage to kick myself into gear under the condition that I run the whole way. It ended up being more of a jog, but I got back to the pod in under ten minutes easy. {&1310}\par There was a hope - small, and fragile - that Ev's father was still alive. It was harder to think of him being dead, remembering the indomitable stares, steely-eyed determination, and resolute steadfastness that he had approached everything with all the years I had known him. He was titanic, and he was scary. Most of all, he always knew just what to do, and I really didn't want to have to make those kinds of decisions right now. I wasn't built for it at all.{&1310}\par But when I got to the clearing again, something was different. It was quiet, and still. Not like where the shuttle lay. Or had it been like that? I couldn't remember. Everything had been so hectic and crazy last time I was there.{&1310}\par The pod was all the way open. I wasn't sure, but I didn't think it had been when I left. Who knows - maybe? I \i had\i0  pulled a whole person out of that thing. Less a couple quarts of blood. Either way, I walked real slow when I got there, eyes darting about at every little thing.{&1310}\par When I got to the pod, I stepped up to look inside. Nolan wasn't there. {&1310}\par My breath caught.{&1310}\par Did the trees just get quieter?{&1310}\par I thought so.{&1310}\par Blood was still spilled all over the insides of that life pod. My knuckles were white above it where the mess had smeared and dried from pulling Ev out. There was too much in there for the old man. I knew that. There was no way he could have been alive. I knew that too. I had seen him. I had seen him dead, and staring.{&1310}\par Hadn't I?{&1310}\par Something moved.{&1310}\par My eyes snapped up, but there was nothing there. Just trees idling gently in the wind, rustling a thousand more leaves. My quick, shallow breathing still managed to drown everything else out. {&1310}\par I glanced around. And then I noticed the other trail of blood.{&1310}\par Ev had bled out all the way back to shuttle - not much, but enough to leave a small trail. This other one, though ... it was much, much bigger. And it led in the other direction. Into the woods.{&1310}\par I followed that red-and-black mess with my eyes up to the treeline. It got dark after that, under the trees - hidden away from the daylight. I couldn't see anything further than a few dozen meters, but the trail didn't stop there.{&1310}\par My tongue was thick in my throat.{&1310}\par "D ... Doctor Weir?" I called out.{&1310}\par Funny. No one answered.{&1310}\par I tried again.{&1310}\par "Doctor Weir!"{&1310}\par A little voice in the back of my head was telling my that no one could have left that much blood behind and still be alive. I dropped down from the pod and fell back a few, halting steps with that thought nagging at me. But my eyes were stuck on that tangle of bark and brambles. I tried to call out again. The sound caught in my throat entirely this time.{&1310}\par Something was moving. Something big. And something black. {&1310}\par The shadows under those trees shifted, and started toward the clearing. There was a moment then, of blind, overwhelming panic where my entire body just froze up in place on me. The next, and neither hands nor feet nor eyes knew which way they wanted to run.

I got distracted by some birds flying about the tops of trees and the cacophony of caws and calls from hidden animals in the forest. It was deafening compared to Riftwatch. And, here, there were no people. It was gusting a little less today too, but not by much.{&1310}\par At some point, I got the idea to check on Dr. Weir and the second life pod. I was restless, and one of the only things on that planet not moving. The pod wasn't far from where the shuttle had crashed, but still I broke out in an anxious fit thinking about something happening to Ev while I was gone. My legs still seemed to work well enough, even if my arm was tender. Eventually, I worked up the courage to kick myself into gear under the condition that I run the whole way. It ended up being more of a jog, but I got back to the pod in under ten minutes easy. {&1310}\par There was a hope - small, and fragile - that Ev's father was still alive. It was harder to think of him being dead, remembering the indomitable stares, steely-eyed determination, and resolute steadfastness that he had approached everything with all the years I had known him. He was titanic, and he was scary. Most of all, he always knew just what to do, and I really didn't want to have to make those kinds of decisions right now. I wasn't built for it at all.{&1310}\par But when I got to the clearing again, something was different. It was quiet, and still. Not like where the shuttle lay. Or had it been like that? I couldn't remember. Everything had been so hectic and crazy last time I was there.{&1310}\par The pod was all the way open. I wasn't sure, but I didn't think it had been when I left. Who knows - maybe? I \i had\i0  pulled a whole person out of that thing. Less a couple quarts of blood. Either way, I walked real slow when I got there, eyes darting about at every little thing.{&1310}\par When I got to the pod, I stepped up to look inside. Weir wasn't there. {&1310}\par My breath caught.{&1310}\par Did the trees just get quieter?{&1310}\par Yes ...{&1310}\par Blood was still spilled all over the insides of that life pod. My knuckles were white above it where the mess had smeared and dried from pulling Ev out. There was too much in there for the old man. I knew that. There was no way he could have been alive. I knew that too. I had seen him. I had seen him dead, and staring.{&1310}\par Hadn't I?{&1310}\par Something moved.{&1310}\par My eyes snapped up, but there was nothing there. Just trees idling gently in the wind, rustling a thousand more leaves. My quick, shallow breathing still managed to drown everything else out. {&1310}\par I glanced around. And then I noticed the other trail of blood.{&1310}\par Ev had bled out all the way back to shuttle - not much, but enough to leave a small trail. This other one, though ... it was much, much bigger. And it led in the other direction. Into the woods.{&1310}\par I followed that red-and-black mess with my eyes up to the treeline. It got dark after that, under the trees - hidden away from the daylight. I couldn't see anything further than a few dozen meters, but the trail didn't stop there.{&1310}\par My tongue was thick in my throat.{&1310}\par "D ... Doctor Weir?" I called out.{&1310}\par Funny. No one answered.{&1310}\par I tried again.{&1310}\par "Doctor Weir!"{&1310}\par A little voice in the back of my head was telling me that there was no way anyone could have left that much blood behind and still be alive. I dropped down from the pod and fell back a few, halting steps with that thought nagging at me. But my eyes were stuck on the tangle of bark and brambles up ahead. I tried to call out again. The sound caught in my throat entirely this time.{&1310}\par Something was moving. Something big. And something black. {&1310}\par The shadows under those trees shifted, and started toward the clearing. There was a moment then of blind, overwhelming panic where my entire body just froze up in place on me. The next, and neither hands nor feet nor eyes knew which way they wanted me to run. Eventually, though, I got my mouth moving at least.{&1310}\par "Shit."{&1310}\par And then I bolted.\cf2 {&1310}\par }{&1310}
