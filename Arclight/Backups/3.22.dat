He had to wave a hand in front of my face to do it. And I didn't linger long before blinking back away. I really didn't like what I saw there right now.{&1310}\par Desperation. Determination. Something else entirely.{&1310}\par I was thinking about back at Shtess, the wya he had guided us out of that nightmare by the hand. Tess' hand. He'd seemed so capable and protective back then, like our own guardian angel. I'd trusted him, and so had Tess. Then I thought about how he'd wanted to execute Richter on the train and abandoned us when we refused to just leave him. When \i Tess\i0  had refused to just leave him.{&1310}\par I belonged with him, I thought. Right here, right now. We were both selfish and terrible, saving ourselves while better people who would have \i done\i0  something got left behind to die. Tess would have done something for me. She would have found a way, or died trying. She wouldn't have given up on me. Ever.{&1310}\par I saw Julian in a whole new way now. The same way I saw myself. He wasn't so strong anymore. He wasn't our protector. I don't know why we ever let ourselves think that he was. He'd never come down there to save us.{&1310}\par He was weak. We both were.{&1310}\par "Hey," he hissed and all but slapped my face to bring me back. "Are you going to make it?"{&1310}\par I stared at him for a second. I wanted to accuse him of being as ready to abandon me as he had Tess. I wanted to, but I didn't. I was too afraid he actually would.{&1310}\par I managed to nod.{&1310}\par He twisted back around and crept ahead along the side of the wall with his rifle. I don't think he meant to kill anyone, but he wouldn't have hesitated either. I knew that. There was an electronic door ahead of us.{&1310}\par They'd begun locking down the port. We found that out pretty quickly when we got there. The guards weren't too heavy yet, and most of them had been busy keeping people out. The rain helped. It hadn't stopped raining all night.{&1310}\par All this, I thought sullenly, because of what I did. I'd murdered those two officers, and two more before I'd changed things. I didn't know how I'd done it, but I had. Somehow. And I had heard those screams as I left. Even if everything was different now, the important details were still the same. Tess and Richter were gone, I was alone, and those men had been murdered. I had heard the screams before I left, and I knew they'd found the same thing hiding in the bathroom that I had when I looked in the mirror that day.{&1310}\par I could have wondered how, but it didn't matter anymore. I was either leaving or dying and that thing would be someone else's problem now.{&1310}\par And Tess'.{&1310}\par While Julian was busy fiddling with the electronic lock on the door controls, I felt something creeping up on us. The rain drowned out sound with its roar, and there were no security in sight down here at the maintenance exit. But I still felt something. The soaked hairs on the back of my neck stirred, and I felt ice pour down my back along the spine. I looked around, but there was nothing.{&1310}\par The air got thick with something other than the rain. I felt it like a thundering pressure everywhere around all at once, a soundless roar that drowned out even the storm. It pushed in hard until it burst. Then it was just ... gone.{&1310}\par I heard the door open of a sudden, and looked at Julian. He squatted back, surprise chiseled into his bluff face. He didn't say anything for a few seconds. Then he just looked at me.{&1310}\par "Let's go."{&1310}\par We snuck into the lower levels of the port building complex. That feeling of being watched had come back, but I didn't say anything to Julian about it. What \i could\i0  I say? I wanted to talk to someone about everything that had happened all the way back to Richter's apartment, but I couldn't talk to him. Not Julian. I wanted to talk to Tess. But I'd turned my back on doing that for good now.{&1310}\par My side hurt, but I tried not to touch it. I just kept a hand there to keep anything else from touching it, and it left me feeling weak and exhausted. I'm not sure how I kept up with Julian, but I did. They gray-slated walls gave way to white marble through a blur of halls and stairwells. I guess we avoided any lifts. There were voices along the way, so there must have been people we avoided. I only knew that because I would bump into Julian and get pulled back into reality. He kept giving me funny looks when he wasn't paying attention to where we were going.{&1310}\par He didn't leave me behind, though. I lagged behind, barely keeping my thinking straight enough to put one foot in front of the other. And he just grabbed me by the hand and dragged me along with him the rest of the way.\cf2\f2 {&1310}\par }{&1310}
