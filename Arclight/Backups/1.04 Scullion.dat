He was walking opposite me across the causeway, I was sure of it. I tried waving and calling, but there were too many people between us. Scholars and students poured out of various halls, shuffling toward the central mess areas. It was around noon. Lunchtime. And I hadn't eaten since breakfast. It was easy to forget in all the excitement.{&1310}\par He got away from me, though, vanishing just like a ghost. I was almost to Bertram's by then, and there wasn't much else to do but give up and go back. For now. I just had that something else to do real quick. It wasn't like he would leave without me anyways, right?{&1310}\par Right.{&1310}\par I stopped right outside Bertram's front door, and stared at it for a minute. I think it might have been the first time I had ever gotten nervous about going in there. Ever. Not that I didn't have a good reason. There was a first time for everything.{&1310}\par Even so, I leaned against the bulkhead for a second or two just to get some of my bearings back.{&1310}\par All the excitement had put me a little on edge. Maybe I had a flash or two of talons in the dark as well from that repressed dream episode. I squeezed my eyes shut for a second and they were there. I took a slow, deep breath after that. {&1310}\par It was fine. {&1310}\par I pushed my way inside.{&1310}\par I guess my luck was running bad lately. The main room was crowded. Quiet - but there were a \i lot\i0  of people in there. At least a few of the undergrads and researchers who apparently thought something of Bertram's cooking. Better than in the mess, I guess. But not much good for me just then.{&1310}\par That lump in my pocket didn't feel very well hidden under my jacket. It felt like everyone in the whole room could see it. A bunch of heads turned on me when I entered, and I froze up. I couldn't help it. For what must have been the longest moment in my life - I stood there, stuck on pins and needles with my back tight to the door behind. There wasn't much else I could do but stare right back. And wait.{&1310}\par It passed. No screaming. No warnings. They just looked away, not very interested at all. {&1310}\par Not that they should have been, of course. Weapons weren't allowed on the station. That's the way things were, and the way they had always been. Who could have possibly thought that me, of all people, would suddenly have one?{&1310}\par I started to breathe again. A little more assured. But it was enough.{&1310}\par "Well hello there, Evie!"{&1310}\par I jumped again. Maybe gasped a bit too loudly too. Stupid. This time, it was at Bertram's pudgy face suddenly sticking out of the kitchen and shouting at me from across the room. I caught myself, and squeezed both eyes shut hard. But my nerves were more than shot. It took another few seconds before I could even work up the courtesy to wave back at the old man.{&1310}\par "Come to see your old pal, Bertram, have you?" he grinned on, throwing a food-stained rag over one aproned shoulder as I made my way unsteadily across the room. "Well, you know I charge a hundred bancors for the first. But the second time is free."{&1310}\par That caught me up for a second. And I breathed a shaky laugh when I started up again. He could get something out of me even at the worst of times. Even if it wasn't that great. I think he enjoyed it more when it wasn't - just ruffling stodgy feathers.{&1310}\par He must have noticed something after all, though, because he shook his head ruefully at me next.{&1310}\par "Just having a little bit of fun with you, Weir-do" he smiled just the same. "Those academics might be walking around with sticks up their asses, but you and Tess are better than that. Nolan did good by you, and so did I. Now," he clapped his hands together and rubbed them briskly, "what can I do you for?"{&1310}\par Another deep breath to steady myself, and I opened my mouth. I suppose I took too long, though, because again he beat me to it.{&1310}\par "Speaking of that horrible little ... you haven't seen her, have you?" he broke in without missing a beat. "She skipped out on me again and hasn't been back all day."{&1310}\par I clapped my mouth shut. Thought about it. And shook my head.{&1310}\par He gave me a long, skeptical look. But that was it. I must have looked pretty bad for him not to start the inquisition.{&1310}\par "You look stressed out, Evie," he said then, mirroring those thoughts. "You fall asleep again during lessons?" That cueball appraised me with a crooked eye. "And speaking of \i that\i0 , just what do you think you're doing here? Shouldn't you be busy studying? I \i know\i0  you're booked up solid with that all week, otherwise I'd have you in here with little Tess scraping my floors." He put his pudgy hands on his hips. And he even managed to sound almost serious. "Just you wait until I tell your father you snuck off to visit old \i Bertram\i0 , huh," he cried in mock astonishment, emphatically shaking that fleshy head. "He'll have you so deep in books all day, you won't see straight for a week!"{&1310}\par "Bertram."{&1310}\par "Oh, right. Where are my manners? Come on in, Evie."{&1310}\par Never mind that I was already in. He waved me into the kitchen and scurried off just the same. Someone called after from the bar, but he just threw a pudgy arm that way with a dismissive grunt.{&1310}\par "I'll be right back!" Bertram shouted over his shoulder, then hit the kitchen door and rounded on me with a whisper none of them could hear, "Dumb, gluttonous bastards. Come on, girl!" He grinned the last at me, letting the door slip open and waving me through.{&1310}\par He got us set up at a counter quickly enough. Something spiced with beef and potatoes filled a bowl or two from the various boiling pots. Not that that stopped Bertram from indulging a few generous samples with his ladle here and there as he wadled back and forth through the kitchen, chattering at me about this and that. I just enjoyed his cooking on an empty stomach for a minute, having heard it all before. I still nodded my head every so often for good measure, though, trying not to look too anxious. It was hard.{&1310}\par "Ahhh," he sighed as he finally sat down across from me, whiffing in a lungful of his own brews emphatically. He took a dainty spoonful, as if he didn't already know how everything in there tasted. {&1310}\par "Now \i this\i0  is a labor of love."{&1310}\par He sipped enthusiastically at some more. Trying to encourage me, I guess. But I had a hard time keeping my mind free. It was all kind of starting to just give me a headache.{&1310}\par I thought we were alone. Maybe Bertram did too. He looked surprised enough when something thumped toward the stairs behind us.{&1310}\par Someone came hopping lackadaisically down those back steps. I looked to see who it was and an infamous mop of rosy-pink hair flopped around as Tess leapt those last few feet, muted music blaring in the air around her head. She came around into the kitchen without a word. Then abruptly stopped short, gaping at both of us.{&1310}\par "Ev!" the pink-haired woman blurted out in surprise, tearing her earphones out with a hand. Her own undoing.{&1310}\par "What are you doing here? Shouldn't you be-"{&1310}\par "HEY!" Bertram twisted his fat mass around in the chair in an instant. He barked so loud the other woman fell back a step.  "What the \i hell \i0 do you think you're doing, girl?"{&1310}\par "Uh ..."{&1310}\par But the old man was already bounding up to his feet.{&1310}\par "I may not be your father but that don't mean I won't beat that scrawny ass 'til it bleeds! GET OVER HERE!"{&1310}\par Tess didn't, though. She spun right around and bolted for the back door, slapping the control and scurrying through. Bertram trudged a few steps after, but there was no use for it. She was already gone. So he just shook a fat fist after her and shouted down the hall.{&1310}\par Letting out a long sigh, he was out of breath when he finally came back. The chair groaned under him again as he leaned back hard.{&1310}\par "Damn me, but I love that girl," he lamented wistfully for a moment. "Don't know what I'll do when she finally gets it in her head to leave. Not like you, Evie," he shook his head at me. "If Nolan had never gotten around to dragging you off you would of grown old and fat here like me." He slapped his stomach so it bounced.{&1310}\par I must have winced, because he laughed. He reached across the counter and slapped my shoulder too.{&1310}\par "Just playing with you, Evie!" he grinned with all his teeth. And settled back again. "Neither of you two were meant to stay here this long. This place is for \i research\i0 ," he mumbled, "and \i academia\i0 ." And shook his pudgy head. "Just luck really that your time came first."{&1310}\par He waved a hand, looking away in thought. It dragged on in silence for a minute or so while I finished. Somehow, the old man was already done. He eventually rounded back on me with a curious eye.{&1310}\par "The captain sent you by, didn't he?"{&1310}\par His tone had gotten serious. Too serious. It made me stop, and look up at him from the bottom of my bowl. Slowly. I nodded my head without a word.{&1310}\par And he nodded his pudgy, bald head right back. Still as somber as the grave. "Nolan said he would talk to him. Thought that fighting stick of yours probably wouldn't be enough. What with you not being so Peekay-inclined." {&1310}\par His heavy gaze moved on again. For a moment. Then he slapped the table with both hands, half-getting up.{&1310}\par "Well. Knew this day would come. Eventually."{&1310}\par He finished the motion, pushing himself up with a hearty groan. I stared at him as he made his way over to the back steps and started up.{&1310}\par "Be right back."{&1310}\par That pistol was burning a hole in my jacket pocket by the time he was. The minutes dragged on in the empty kitchen until then while I listened to pots boil and an oven timer go off. He took a second after hauling his bulk back down with a box in one hand to switch the timer and check the oven. Then he was back with me.{&1310}\par That box came down on the counter between us. I didn't get to see what was inside it. But he pulled something out. He held it up for me to see.{&1310}\par "You know what this is, right?" he asked, twisting the slug of smooth obsidian. It didn't reflect any of the kitchen lights at all. It was just a dark spot in the bright room, black as midnight.{&1310}\par "Trope round," he explained. I don't think I'd ever seen him so serious for so long. He closed the box and held out his other hand to me.{&1310}\par "Let me see it."{&1310}\par I didn't have to ask him what he meant. I just pulled the pistol out of my pocket without thinking, and pushed it into his waiting hand. He popped open a release on the chamber, showing it to me, before pushing the pitch-black round inside. He clicked it back shut and the thing sang aloud with a shrill ring.{&1310}\par "Release the safety," he told me, slipping his thumb along the side of the stock. "Point," he pointed it away into the room. "Aim down both sights." He closed an eye. "Breathe out." He did. "And squeeze."{&1310}\par There had been a big, old bucket sitting over there on the floor next to the wall. Something flashed across the room with a shrill scream of light. A half a second. And then that bucket was slapping the bulkhead on its own, a big black hole rent through the side. Dirty water started rushing out. More sloshed wildly over the brim.{&1310}\par I jumped at that. I couldn't help it. And it took me almost a full minute to shake it off. Bertram didn't seem to notice.{&1310}\par "Not like in the vids, huh? Things aren't the same down planetside," he was saying, staring off into space after that bolt. For some reason, the mess didn't seem to bother him all that much. "Or anywhere else for that matter. There's a good reason we don't allow these things in Riftwatch. Peekaylings are bad enough."{&1310}\par At some point, he turned back on me. The pistol had made it back into my jacket pocket all on its own.{&1310}\par "I just hope you never have to use it," he told me. Then smiled. Sadly. And it was the saddest look I had ever seen him make.{&1310}\par He just reached out and squeezed my shoulder.{&1310}\par "Take good care of yourself, Evie."\cf2 {&1310}\par }{&1310}

Once. Walking opposite me across the causeway. There were too many people between us, though. Scholars poured out of various halls, shuffling arthritic feet toward one of the central mess halls. It was around noon. Lunchtime. And I hadn't eaten since breakfast. But I was too busy for that right now.{&1310}\par I lost sight of him. He vanished like a ghost. I was almost to Bertram's hostel, though, and I gave it up for a moment. I would find him. I had that something else to do real quick.{&1310}\par I stopped outside the fat, old man's front door, though. I think it was the first time I ever got nervous about going in there. Ever. And I took a moment to lean against the bulkheads. All the excitement had me a little on edge.{&1310}\par I still managed to push my way inside a minute later. And came up quickly enough. There were a lot of people in the open room that greeted me - monks and scholars who apparently thought something of Bertram's cooking. It \i was\i0  probably better than in the mess. But it wasn't much good for me.{&1310}\par That lump in my pocket didn't feel very well hidden under my jacket. It felt like everyone in the whole room could see it. A bunch of heads turned on me when I entered, and I froze up. For what must have been the longest moment in my life I stood there, stuck like pins held my back tight to the door behind. Then it passed. They looked away, not very interested at all. And I could breathe again.{&1310}\par "Well hello there, Evelyn!"{&1310}\par I jumped again. This time it was at Bertram's pudgy face suddenly sticking out of the kitchen and shouting at me from across the room with a grin. I caught myself, squeezing both eyes shut. Stupid. But my nerves were more than shot. Another few seconds and I even worked up the courtesy to wave back at the old man.{&1310}\par "Come to see your old pal, Bertram, have you?" he grinned on, throwing a food-stained rag over one aproned shoulder as I made my way uneasily across the room. "Well, you know I charge a hundred bancors for the first time, but the second time is free."{&1310}\par That caught me up for a second. And I breathed a laugh when I started up again and came up to him outside the kitchen. He could get something out of me even at the worst of time. I think he enjoyed that.{&1310}\par He must have noticed, though, because he shook his head ruefully at me next.{&1310}\par "Just have a little bit of fun with you, young lady," he smiled just the same. "Those monks might be walking around with sticks up their asses, but you and Tess are better than that. Nolan did right by you, and so did I.

"She skipped out on me again and hasn't been back all \i day\i0 ."{&1310}\par I clapped my mouth shut. Thought about it. And shook my head.{&1310}\par He gave me a long, skeptical look. But that was it.{&1310}\par "You look stressed out, Eve," he said then. "You fall asleep again during lessons? Speaking of that, what are you doing here? Shouldn't you be studying? You just \i wait\i0  until I tell your father you snuck off to visit old Bertram, he'll have you so deep in books all day, you won't see straight for a week!"{&1310}\par "Bertram."{&1310}\par "Oh, right. Where are my manners? Come on in, Evelyn."{&1310}\par Never mind that I was already in. He waved me into the kitchen and scurried off just the same. Someone shouted after from the bar, but he just threw a pudgy arm back with a dismissive grunt.{&1310}\par "I'll be right back!" Bertram cried irritably back, then hit the kitchen door and rounded on me with a whisper none of them could hear, "you \i stupid \i0 bastards. Come on, girl!" He grinned the last at me, letting the door slip open and waving me through.{&1310}\par He got us set up at a counter quickly enough. Something spiced with beef and potatoes filled a bowl or two from the various boiling pots. Not that that stopped Bertram from indulging a few generous samples with his ladle here and there as he wadled back and forth through the kitchen, chattering at me about this and that. I just enjoyed his cooking on an empty stomach for a minute, having heard it all before. I still nodded my head every so often for good measure.{&1310}\par "Ahhh," he sighed as he finally sat down across from me, whiffing in a lungful of his own brews emphatically. He took a spoonful delicately, as if he didn't already know how everything in there tasted. "Now \i this\i0  is a labor of love."{&1310}\par He sipped enthusiastically at some more, trying to encourage me, I guess. I had a hard time keeping my mind free, though. That dream from earlier started to creep back in too.{&1310}\par Someone came hopping lackadaisically down the back steps. I looked to see who it was. A now infamous mop of rosy-pink hair flopped around as whoever it was leapt the last few feet, muted music blaring loud about her head. Then that someone came up short, gaping at both of us.{&1310}\par "Eve!" Tess blurted out in surprise, tearing her earphones out with a hand. Her own undoing.{&1310}\par "What are you doing here?

Get over here!"{&1310}\par Tess didn't, though. She spun right around and bolted for the back door, slapping the control and scurrying through. Bertram trudged a few steps after, but there no use for it. She was already gone. So he just shook a fat fist after her and shouted down the hall.{&1310}\par He let out a long sigh, out of breath, when he finally came back. The chair groaned under him again as he leaned back hard.{&1310}\par "Damn me, but I love that girl," he lamented wistfully for a moment. "Don't know what I'll do when she finally gets it in her head to leave. Not like you, Eve," he shook his head at me. "If Nolan had never gotten around to dragging you off you would of grown old and fat here like me." He slapped his stomach so it bounced.{&1310}\par I must have winced, because he laughed. He reached across the counter and slapped my shoulder too.{&1310}\par "Just playing with you, girl!" he grinned with all his teeth. And settled back again. "Neither of you two were meant to stay here this long. Just luck that your time came first."{&1310}\par He waved a hand, looking away in thought.

I didn't get to see what was inside it. But he pulled something out. He held it up for me to see.{&1310}\par "You know what this is, right?" he asked, twisting the slug of smooth obsidian. It didn't reflect any of the kitchen lights at all. It was just a black spot in the bright room, dark as midnight.{&1310}\par "Trope round," he explained. I don't think I'd ever seen him so serious for so long. He closed the box and held out his other hand to me.{&1310}\par "Let me see it."{&1310}\par I didn't have to ask him what he meant.

He clicked it back shut.{&1310}\par "Release the safety," he told me, slipping his thumb along the side of the stock. "Point," he pointed it away into the room. "Aim down both sights." He closed an eye. "Breathe out." He did. "And fire."{&1310}\par There had been a big, old bucket sitting over there on the floor next to the wall.

And I took a moment to lean against the bulkheads. All the excitement had me a little on edge.{&1310}\par I still managed to push my way inside a minute later. And came up quickly enough. There were a lot of people in the open room that greeted me - monks and scholars who apparently thought something of Bertram's cooking. It \i was\i0  probably better than in the mess. But it wasn't much good for me.{&1310}\par That lump in my pocket didn't feel very well hidden under my jacket. It felt like everyone in the whole room could see it. A bunch of heads turned on me when I entered, and I froze up. For what must have been the longest moment in my life I stood there, stuck like pins held my back tight to the door behind. Then it passed. They looked away, not very interested at all. And I could breathe again.{&1310}\par "Well hello there, Evelyn!"{&1310}\par I jumped again. This time it was at Bertram's pudgy face suddenly sticking out of the kitchen and shouting at me from across the room with a grin. I caught myself, squeezing both eyes shut. Stupid.

"Well, you know I charge a hundred bancors for the first time, but the second time is free."{&1310}\par That caught me up for a second. And I breathed a laugh when I started up again and came up to him outside the kitchen. He could get something out of me even at the worst of time. I think he enjoyed that.{&1310}\par He must have noticed, though, because he shook his head ruefully at me next.{&1310}\par "Just have a little bit of fun with you, young lady," he smiled just the same.

He was walking opposite me across the causeway, I was sure of it. I tried waving and calling, but there were too many people between us. Scholars poured out of various halls, shuffling toward the central mess halls. It was around noon. Lunchtime. And I hadn't eaten since breakfast. It was easy to forget in all the excitement.{&1310}\par He got away from me, though, vanishing just like a ghost. I was almost to Bertram's by then, and there wasn't much else to do but give up and go back. For now. I just had that something else to do real quick. It wasn't like he would leave without me anyways, right?{&1310}\par Right.{&1310}\par I stopped right outside the Bertram's front door, and stared at it for a minute. I think it might be the first time I had ever gotten nervous about going in there. Ever. Not that I didn't have a good reason. There was a first time for everything.{&1310}\par Even so, I leaned against the bulkhead for a second or two just to get some of my bearings back.{&1310}\par All the excitement had put me a little on edge. Maybe I had a flash or two of talons in the dark as well. I squeezed my eyes shut for a second and they were there. I took a slow, deep breath after that. {&1310}\par It was fine. And I pushed my way inside.{&1310}\par I guess my luck was running bad lately. The main room was crowded. Quiet - but there were a \i lot\i0  of people in there. At least a few of the monks and scholars who apparently thought something of Bertram's cooking. Better than in the mess, I guess. But not much good for me just then.{&1310}\par That lump in my pocket didn't feel very well hidden under my jacket. It felt like everyone in the whole room could see it. A bunch of heads turned on me when I entered, and I froze up. I couldn't help it. For what must have been the longest moment in my life I stood there, stuck on pins and needles with my back tight to the door behind. There wasn't much else I could do but stare right back. And wait.{&1310}\par It passed. No screaming. No warnings. They just looked away, not very interested at all. {&1310}\par Not that they should have been, of course. Weapons weren't allowed on the station. That's the way things were, and the way they always had been. Who could have possibly thought that me, of all people, would suddenly have one?{&1310}\par I started to breathe again. A little more assured. But it was enough.{&1310}\par "Well hello there, Evie!"{&1310}\par I jumped again. Maybe gasped a bit too loudly too. Stupid. This time, it was at Bertram's pudgy face suddenly sticking out of the kitchen and shouting at me from across the room. I caught myself, and squeezed both eyes shut hard. But my nerves were more than shot. It took another few seconds before I could even work up the courtesy to wave back at the old man.{&1310}\par "Come to see your old pal, Bertram, have you?" he grinned on, throwing a food-stained rag over one aproned shoulder as I made my way unsteadily across the room. "Well, you know I charge a hundred bancors for the first. But the second time is free."{&1310}\par That caught me up for a second. And I breathed a shaky laugh when I started up again. He could get something out of me even at the worst of times. Even if it wasn't that great. I think he enjoyed it more when it wasn't.{&1310}\par He must have noticed something, though, because he shook his head ruefully at me next.{&1310}\par "Just have a wee bit of fun with you, young lady," he smiled just the same. "Those monks might be walking around with sticks up their asses, but you and Tess are better than that. Nolan did right by you, and so did I. Now," he clapped his hands together and rubbed them briskly, "what can I do you for?"{&1310}\par Another deep breath to steady myself, and I opened my mouth. I suppose I took too long, though, because again he beat me to it.{&1310}\par "Speaking of that horrible little bitch, you haven't seen her, have you?" he broke in without missing a beat. "She skipped out on me again and hasn't been back all \i day\i0 ."{&1310}\par I clapped my mouth shut. Thought about it. And shook my head.{&1310}\par He gave me a long, skeptical look. But that was it. I must have looked pretty bad for him not to start the inquisition.{&1310}\par "You look stressed out, Evie," he said then, mirroring those thoughts. "You fall asleep again during lessons?" That cueball appraised me with a crooked eye. "And speaking of \i that\i0 , just what do you think you're doing here? Shouldn't you be busy studying? I \i know\i0  you're booked up solid with that all week, otherwise I'd have you in here with little Tess scraping my floors." He put his pudgy hands on his hips. And he even managed to sound almost serious. "Just you wait until I tell your father you snuck off to visit old \i Bertram\i0 , huh," he cried in mock astonishment, emphatically shaking that fleshy head. "He'll have you so deep in books all day, you won't see straight for a week!"{&1310}\par "Bertram."{&1310}\par "Oh, right. Where are my manners? Come on in, Evie."{&1310}\par Never mind that I was already in. He waved me into the kitchen and scurried off just the same. Someone called after from the bar, but he just threw a pudgy arm that way with a dismissive grunt.{&1310}\par "I'll be right back!" Bertram shouted over his shoulder, then hit the kitchen door and rounded on me with a whisper none of them could hear, "You \i stupid \i0 bastards. Come on, girl!" He grinned the last at me, letting the door slip open and waving me through.{&1310}\par He got us set up at a counter quickly enough. Something spiced with beef and potatoes filled a bowl or two from the various boiling pots. Not that that stopped Bertram from indulging a few generous samples with his ladle here and there as he wadled back and forth through the kitchen, chattering at me about this and that. I just enjoyed his cooking on an empty stomach for a minute, having heard it all before. I still nodded my head every so often for good measure, though, trying not to look too anxious. It was hard.{&1310}\par "Ahhh," he sighed as he finally sat down across from me, whiffing in a lungful of his own brews emphatically. He took a dainty spoonful, as if he didn't already know how everything in there tasted. {&1310}\par "Now \i this\i0  is a labor of love."{&1310}\par He sipped enthusiastically at some more. Trying to encourage me, I guess. But I had a hard time keeping my mind free. And that dream from earlier had started to creep back in too.{&1310}\par I thought we were alone. Maybe Bertram did too. He looked surprised enough when something thumped toward the stairs behind us.{&1310}\par Someone came hopping lackadaisically down those back steps. I looked to see who it was and an infamous mop of rosy-pink hair flopped around as Tess leapt those last few feet, muted music blaring in the air around her head. She came around into the kitchen without a word. Then abruptly stopped short, gaping at both of us.{&1310}\par "Ev!" the pink-haired woman blurted out in surprise, tearing her earphones out with a hand. Her own undoing.{&1310}\par "What are you doing here? Shouldn't you be-"{&1310}\par "HEY!" Bertram twisted his fat mass around in the chair in an instant. He barked so loud the other woman fell back a step.  "What the \i hell \i0 do you think you're doing, girl?"{&1310}\par "Uh ..."{&1310}\par But the old man was already bounding up to his feet.{&1310}\par "I may not be your father but that don't mean I won't beat that scrawny ass 'til it bleeds! GET OVER HERE!"{&1310}\par Tess didn't, though. She spun right around and bolted for the back door, slapping the control and scurrying through. Bertram trudged a few steps after, but there was no use for it. She was already gone. So he just shook a fat fist after her and shouted down the hall.{&1310}\par He let out a long sigh, out of breath, when he finally came back. The chair groaned under him again as he leaned back hard.{&1310}\par "Damn me, I love that girl," he lamented wistfully for a moment. "Don't know what I'll do when she finally gets it in her head to leave. Not like you, Evie," he shook his head at me. "If Nolan had never gotten around to dragging you off you would of grown old and fat here like me." He slapped his stomach so it bounced.{&1310}\par I must have winced, because he laughed. He reached across the counter and slapped my shoulder too.{&1310}\par "Just playing with you, Evie!" he grinned with all his teeth. And settled back again. "Neither of you two were meant to stay here this long. Just luck that your time came first."{&1310}\par He waved a hand, looking away in thought. It dragged on in silence for a minute or so while I finished. Somehow, the old man was already done. He eventually rounded back on me with a curious eye.{&1310}\par "The Warden sent you by, didn't he?"{&1310}\par His tone has gotten serious. Too serious. It made me stop, and look up at him from the bottom of my bowl. Slowly. I nodded my head without a word.{&1310}\par And he nodded his pudgy, bald head right back. Still as somber as the grave. "Nolan said he would talk to him. Thought that fighting stick of yours probably wouldn't be enough. What with you not being so Voidtongue-inclined." {&1310}\par His heavy gaze moved on again. For a moment. Then he slapped the table with both hands, half-getting up.{&1310}\par "Well. Knew this day would come. Eventually."{&1310}\par He finished the motion, pushing himself up with a hearty groan. I stared at him as he made his way over to the back steps and started up.{&1310}\par "Be right back."{&1310}\par That pistol was burning a hole in my jacket pocket by the time he was. The minutes dragged on in the empty kitchen until then while I listened to pots boil and an oven timer go off. He took a second after hauling his bulk back down with a box in one hand to switch the timer and check the oven. Then he was back with me.{&1310}\par That box came down on the counter between us. I didn't get to see what was inside it. But he pulled something out. He held it up for me to see.{&1310}\par "You know what this is, right?" he asked, twisting the slug of smooth obsidian. It didn't reflect any of the kitchen lights at all. It was just a dark spot in the bright room, black as midnight.{&1310}\par "Trope round," he explained. I don't think I'd ever seen him so serious for so long. He closed the box and held out his other hand to me.{&1310}\par "Let me see it."{&1310}\par I didn't have to ask him what he meant. I just pulled the firebolt out of my pocket without thinking, and pushed it into his waiting hand. He popped open a release on the chamber, showing it to me, before pushing the pitch-black round inside. He clicked it back shut.{&1310}\par "Release the safety," he told me, slipping his thumb along the side of the stock. "Point," he pointed it away into the room. "Aim down both sights." He closed an eye. "Breathe out." He did. "And fire."{&1310}\par There had been a big, old bucket sitting over there on the floor next to the wall. Something flashed across the room with a shrill scream of light. A half a second. And then that bucket was slapping the bulkhead on its own, a big black hole rent through the side. Dirty water started rushing out. More sloshed wildly over the brim.{&1310}\par I jumped at that. I couldn't help it. And it took me almost a full minute to shake it off. Bertram didn't seem to notice.{&1310}\par "Things aren't the same down planetside," he was saying, staring off into space after that bolt. For some reason, the mess didn't seem to bother him all that much. "Or anywhere else for that matter. There's a good reason we don't allow these things in Riftwatch. Spinners are bad enough."{&1310}\par At some point, he turned back on me. The pistol had made it back into my jacket pocket all on its own.{&1310}\par "I just hope you never have to use it," he told me. Then smiled. Sadly. And it was the saddest look I had ever seen him make.{&1310}\par He just reached out and squeezed my shoulder.{&1310}\par "Take good care of yourself, Evie."\cf2\f2 {&1310}\par }{&1310}

It took another few seconds before I could even work up the courtesy to wave back at the old man.{&1310}\par "Come to see your old pal, Bertram, have you?" he grinned on, throwing a food-stained rag over one aproned shoulder as I made my way unsteadily across the room. "Well, you know I charge a hundred bancors for the first. But the second time is free."{&1310}\par That caught me up for a second. And I breathed a shaky laugh when I started up again. He could get something out of me even at the worst of times. Even if it wasn't that great. I think he enjoyed it more when it wasn't.{&1310}\par He must have noticed something, though, because he shook his head ruefully at me next.{&1310}\par "Just having a little bit of fun with you, Weir-do" he smiled just the same. "Those academics might be walking around with sticks up their asses, but you and Tess are better than that. Nolan did good by you, and so did I. Now," he clapped his hands together and rubbed them briskly, "what can I do you for?"{&1310}\par Another deep breath to steady myself, and I opened my mouth. I suppose I took too long, though, because again he beat me to it.{&1310}\par "Speaking of that horrible little ... you haven't seen her, have you?" he broke in without missing a beat. "She skipped out on me again and hasn't been back all day."{&1310}\par I clapped my mouth shut. Thought about it. And shook my head.{&1310}\par He gave me a long, skeptical look. But that was it. I must have looked pretty bad for him not to start the inquisition.{&1310}\par "You look stressed out, Evie," he said then, mirroring those thoughts. "You fall asleep again during lessons?" That cueball appraised me with a crooked eye. "And speaking of \i that\i0 , just what do you think you're doing here? Shouldn't you be busy studying? I \i know\i0  you're booked up solid with that all week, otherwise I'd have you in here with little Tess scraping my floors." He put his pudgy hands on his hips. And he even managed to sound almost serious. "Just you wait until I tell your father you snuck off to visit old \i Bertram\i0 , huh," he cried in mock astonishment, emphatically shaking that fleshy head. "He'll have you so deep in books all day, you won't see straight for a week!"{&1310}\par "Bertram."{&1310}\par "Oh, right. Where are my manners? Come on in, Evie."{&1310}\par Never mind that I was already in. He waved me into the kitchen and scurried off just the same. Someone called after from the bar, but he just threw a pudgy arm that way with a dismissive grunt.{&1310}\par "I'll be right back!" Bertram shouted over his shoulder, then hit the kitchen door and rounded on me with a whisper none of them could hear, "You \i stupid \i0 bastards. Come on, girl!" He grinned the last at me, letting the door slip open and waving me through.{&1310}\par He got us set up at a counter quickly enough. Something spiced with beef and potatoes filled a bowl or two from the various boiling pots. Not that that stopped Bertram from indulging a few generous samples with his ladle here and there as he wadled back and forth through the kitchen, chattering at me about this and that. I just enjoyed his cooking on an empty stomach for a minute, having heard it all before. I still nodded my head every so often for good measure, though, trying not to look too anxious. It was hard.{&1310}\par "Ahhh," he sighed as he finally sat down across from me, whiffing in a lungful of his own brews emphatically. He took a dainty spoonful, as if he didn't already know how everything in there tasted. {&1310}\par "Now \i this\i0  is a labor of love."{&1310}\par He sipped enthusiastically at some more. Trying to encourage me, I guess. But I had a hard time keeping my mind free. And that dream from earlier had started to creep back in too.{&1310}\par I thought we were alone. Maybe Bertram did too. He looked surprised enough when something thumped toward the stairs behind us.{&1310}\par Someone came hopping lackadaisically down those back steps. I looked to see who it was and an infamous mop of rosy-pink hair flopped around as Tess leapt those last few feet, muted music blaring in the air around her head. She came around into the kitchen without a word. Then abruptly stopped short, gaping at both of us.{&1310}\par "Ev!" the pink-haired woman blurted out in surprise, tearing her earphones out with a hand. Her own undoing.{&1310}\par "What are you doing here? Shouldn't you be-"{&1310}\par "HEY!" Bertram twisted his fat mass around in the chair in an instant. He barked so loud the other woman fell back a step.  "What the \i hell \i0 do you think you're doing, girl?"{&1310}\par "Uh ..."{&1310}\par But the old man was already bounding up to his feet.{&1310}\par "I may not be your father but that don't mean I won't beat that scrawny ass 'til it bleeds! GET OVER HERE!"{&1310}\par Tess didn't, though. She spun right around and bolted for the back door, slapping the control and scurrying through. Bertram trudged a few steps after, but there was no use for it. She was already gone. So he just shook a fat fist after her and shouted down the hall.{&1310}\par He let out a long sigh, out of breath, when he finally came back. The chair groaned under him again as he leaned back hard.{&1310}\par "Damn me, I love that girl," he lamented wistfully for a moment. "Don't know what I'll do when she finally gets it in her head to leave. Not like you, Evie," he shook his head at me. "If Nolan had never gotten around to dragging you off you would of grown old and fat here like me." He slapped his stomach so it bounced.{&1310}\par I must have winced, because he laughed. He reached across the counter and slapped my shoulder too.{&1310}\par "Just playing with you, Evie!" he grinned with all his teeth. And settled back again. "Neither of you two were meant to stay here this long. Just luck that your time came first."{&1310}\par He waved a hand, looking away in thought. It dragged on in silence for a minute or so while I finished. Somehow, the old man was already done. He eventually rounded back on me with a curious eye.{&1310}\par "The captain sent you by, didn't he?"{&1310}\par His tone had gotten serious. Too serious. It made me stop, and look up at him from the bottom of my bowl. Slowly. I nodded my head without a word.{&1310}\par And he nodded his pudgy, bald head right back. Still as somber as the grave. "Nolan said he would talk to him. Thought that fighting stick of yours probably wouldn't be enough. What with you not being so Voidtongue-inclined." {&1310}\par His heavy gaze moved on again. For a moment. Then he slapped the table with both hands, half-getting up.{&1310}\par "Well. Knew this day would come. Eventually."{&1310}\par He finished the motion, pushing himself up with a hearty groan. I stared at him as he made his way over to the back steps and started up.{&1310}\par "Be right back."{&1310}\par That pistol was burning a hole in my jacket pocket by the time he was. The minutes dragged on in the empty kitchen until then while I listened to pots boil and an oven timer go off. He took a second after hauling his bulk back down with a box in one hand to switch the timer and check the oven. Then he was back with me.{&1310}\par That box came down on the counter between us. I didn't get to see what was inside it. But he pulled something out. He held it up for me to see.{&1310}\par "You know what this is, right?" he asked, twisting the slug of smooth obsidian. It didn't reflect any of the kitchen lights at all. It was just a dark spot in the bright room, black as midnight.{&1310}\par "Trope round," he explained. I don't think I'd ever seen him so serious for so long. He closed the box and held out his other hand to me.{&1310}\par "Let me see it."{&1310}\par I didn't have to ask him what he meant. I just pulled the pistol out of my pocket without thinking, and pushed it into his waiting hand. He popped open a release on the chamber, showing it to me, before pushing the pitch-black round inside. He clicked it back shut.{&1310}\par "Release the safety," he told me, slipping his thumb along the side of the stock. "Point," he pointed it away into the room. "Aim down both sights." He closed an eye. "Breathe out." He did. "And squeeze."{&1310}\par There had been a big, old bucket sitting over there on the floor next to the wall. Something flashed across the room with a shrill scream of light. A half a second. And then that bucket was slapping the bulkhead on its own, a big black hole rent through the side. Dirty water started rushing out. More sloshed wildly over the brim.{&1310}\par I jumped at that. I couldn't help it. And it took me almost a full minute to shake it off. Bertram didn't seem to notice.{&1310}\par "Things aren't the same down planetside," he was saying, staring off into space after that bolt. For some reason, the mess didn't seem to bother him all that much. "Or anywhere else for that matter. There's a good reason we don't allow these things in Riftwatch. Spinners are bad enough."{&1310}\par At some point, he turned back on me. The pistol had made it back into my jacket pocket all on its own.{&1310}\par "I just hope you never have to use it," he told me. Then smiled. Sadly. And it was the saddest look I had ever seen him make.{&1310}\par He just reached out and squeezed my shoulder.{&1310}\par "Take good care of yourself, Evie."\cf2\f2 {&1310}\par }{&1310}

He was walking opposite me across the causeway, I was sure of it. I tried waving and calling, but there were too many people between us. Scholars poured out of various halls, shuffling toward the central mess halls. It was around noon. Lunchtime. And I hadn't eaten since breakfast. It was easy to forget in all the excitement.{&1310}\par He got away from me, though, vanishing just like a ghost. I was almost to Bertram's by then, and there wasn't much else to do but give up and go back. For now. I just had that something else to do real quick. It wasn't like he would leave without me anyways, right?{&1310}\par Right.{&1310}\par I stopped right outside Bertram's front door, and stared at it for a minute. I think it might have been the first time I had ever gotten nervous about going in there. Ever. Not that I didn't have a good reason. There was a first time for everything.{&1310}\par Even so, I leaned against the bulkhead for a second or two just to get some of my bearings back.{&1310}\par All the excitement had put me a little on edge. Maybe I had a flash or two of talons in the dark as well. I squeezed my eyes shut for a second and they were there. I took a slow, deep breath after that. {&1310}\par It was fine. And I pushed my way inside.{&1310}\par I guess my luck was running bad lately. The main room was crowded. Quiet - but there were a \i lot\i0  of people in there. At least a few of the spinner-wannabees and scholars who apparently thought something of Bertram's cooking. Better than in the mess, I guess. But not much good for me just then.{&1310}\par That lump in my pocket didn't feel very well hidden under my jacket. It felt like everyone in the whole room could see it. A bunch of heads turned on me when I entered, and I froze up. I couldn't help it. For what must have been the longest moment in my life I stood there, stuck on pins and needles with my back tight to the door behind. There wasn't much else I could do but stare right back. And wait.{&1310}\par It passed. No screaming. No warnings. They just looked away, not very interested at all. {&1310}\par Not that they should have been, of course. Weapons weren't allowed on the station. That's the way things were, and the way they had always been. Who could have possibly thought that me, of all people, would suddenly have one?{&1310}\par I started to breathe again. A little more assured. But it was enough.{&1310}\par "Well hello there, Evie!"{&1310}\par I jumped again. Maybe gasped a bit too loudly too. Stupid.

Trying to encourage me, I guess. But I had a hard time keeping my mind free. It was all kind of starting to just give me a headache.{&1310}\par I thought we were alone. Maybe Bertram did too. He looked surprised enough when something thumped toward the stairs behind us.{&1310}\par Someone came hopping lackadaisically down those back steps. I looked to see who it was and an infamous mop of rosy-pink hair flopped around as Tess leapt those last few feet, muted music blaring in the air around her head. She came around into the kitchen without a word. Then abruptly stopped short, gaping at both of us.{&1310}\par "Ev!" the pink-haired woman blurted out in surprise, tearing her earphones out with a hand. Her own undoing.{&1310}\par "What are you doing here? Shouldn't you be-"{&1310}\par "HEY!" Bertram twisted his fat mass around in the chair in an instant. He barked so loud the other woman fell back a step.  "What the \i hell \i0 do you think you're doing, girl?"{&1310}\par "Uh ..."{&1310}\par But the old man was already bounding up to his feet.{&1310}\par "I may not be your father but that don't mean I won't beat that scrawny ass 'til it bleeds! GET OVER HERE!"{&1310}\par Tess didn't, though. She spun right around and bolted for the back door, slapping the control and scurrying through. Bertram trudged a few steps after, but there was no use for it. She was already gone. So he just shook a fat fist after her and shouted down the hall.{&1310}\par Letting out a long sigh, he was out of breath when he finally came back. The chair groaned under him again as he leaned back hard.{&1310}\par "Damn me, but I love that girl," he lamented wistfully for a moment. "Don't know what I'll do when she finally gets it in her head to leave. Not like you, Evie," he shook his head at me. "If Nolan had never gotten around to dragging you off you would of grown old and fat here like me." He slapped his stomach so it bounced.{&1310}\par I must have winced, because he laughed. He reached across the counter and slapped my shoulder too.{&1310}\par "Just playing with you, Evie!" he grinned with all his teeth. And settled back again. "Neither of you two were meant to stay here this long. This place is for \i research\i0 ," he mumbled, "and \i academia\i0 ." And shook his pudgy head. "Just luck really that your time came first."{&1310}\par He waved a hand, looking away in thought. It dragged on in silence for a minute or so while I finished. Somehow, the old man was already done. He eventually rounded back on me with a curious eye.{&1310}\par "The captain sent you by, didn't he?"{&1310}\par His tone had gotten serious. Too serious. It made me stop, and look up at him from the bottom of my bowl. Slowly. I nodded my head without a word.{&1310}\par And he nodded his pudgy, bald head right back. Still as somber as the grave. "Nolan said he would talk to him. Thought that fighting stick of yours probably wouldn't be enough. What with you not being so Peekay-inclined." {&1310}\par His heavy gaze moved on again. For a moment. Then he slapped the table with both hands, half-getting up.{&1310}\par "Well. Knew this day would come. Eventually."{&1310}\par He finished the motion, pushing himself up with a hearty groan. I stared at him as he made his way over to the back steps and started up.{&1310}\par "Be right back."{&1310}\par That pistol was burning a hole in my jacket pocket by the time he was. The minutes dragged on in the empty kitchen until then while I listened to pots boil and an oven timer go off. He took a second after hauling his bulk back down with a box in one hand to switch the timer and check the oven. Then he was back with me.{&1310}\par That box came down on the counter between us. I didn't get to see what was inside it. But he pulled something out. He held it up for me to see.{&1310}\par "You know what this is, right?" he asked, twisting the slug of smooth obsidian. It didn't reflect any of the kitchen lights at all. It was just a dark spot in the bright room, black as midnight.{&1310}\par "Trope round," he explained. I don't think I'd ever seen him so serious for so long. He closed the box and held out his other hand to me.{&1310}\par "Let me see it."{&1310}\par I didn't have to ask him what he meant. I just pulled the pistol out of my pocket without thinking, and pushed it into his waiting hand. He popped open a release on the chamber, showing it to me, before pushing the pitch-black round inside. He clicked it back shut and the thing sang aloud with a shrill ring.{&1310}\par "Release the safety," he told me, slipping his thumb along the side of the stock. "Point," he pointed it away into the room. "Aim down both sights." He closed an eye. "Breathe out." He did. "And squeeze."{&1310}\par There had been a big, old bucket sitting over there on the floor next to the wall. Something flashed across the room with a shrill scream of light. A half a second. And then that bucket was slapping the bulkhead on its own, a big black hole rent through the side. Dirty water started rushing out. More sloshed wildly over the brim.{&1310}\par I jumped at that. I couldn't help it. And it took me almost a full minute to shake it off. Bertram didn't seem to notice.{&1310}\par "Not like in the vids, huh? Things aren't the same down planetside," he was saying, staring off into space after that bolt. For some reason, the mess didn't seem to bother him all that much. "Or anywhere else for that matter. There's a good reason we don't allow these things in Riftwatch. Peekaylings are bad enough."{&1310}\par At some point, he turned back on me. The pistol had made it back into my jacket pocket all on its own.{&1310}\par "I just hope you never have to use it," he told me. Then smiled. Sadly. And it was the saddest look I had ever seen him make.{&1310}\par He just reached out and squeezed my shoulder.{&1310}\par "Take good care of yourself, Evie."\cf2 {&1310}\par }{&1310}
