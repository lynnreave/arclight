I barked a laugh as confidently as I could at him, stabbing the pistol a little more forcefully that way. "You're going to help us," I snapped. "Now!"{&1310}\par It was his turn to laugh at me then, but it came off as a wretched little twist of his tattooed face. "You expect me to help you?" he uttered, low and incredulous. "After what you just did to my ship?" There was the ghost of a sardonic smile on his lips.{&1310}\par I just nodded. "Or I can kill you," I warned, but stumbled over the "kill" part. It sounded right for the scene in my head, anyways. I tried to make up for it by stabbing hard at him with the gun again.{&1310}\par That irritated and amused look left his face, and just turned irritated. It flattened out, and there was that now familiar, dangerous glint in his eyes again. {&1310}\par "I don't have time for this," was all he said before turning once more to leave.{&1310}\par I guess it was a big surprise when the gun in my hand suddenly went off in a bright flash.\cf2 {&1310}\par }{&1310}
