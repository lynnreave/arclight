Thank a god for small favors.{&1310}\par My feet hurt. My legs hurt. My whole body hurt. So I just lay there, face-down in the dirt, breathing hard and not daring to stir a single other muscle. I didn't know where we were. I didn't even care to look. I just lay there. That was enough.{&1310}\par Julian kept moving around. A little stiff in his step, but worlds apart from me after all that hiking through this wilderness. If not for me, he might have kept going on through the night. If not for Ev, he might have gone on forever. Instead, he just stuck around with us humans for a bit.{&1310}\par I didn't even realize I had fallen asleep again until I smelled something rich and smoky in the air. It got me blinking up in surprise to find Julian resting on his haunches across a bunch of burning branches from me, the whole mess tossed in the dirt and spitting out smoke. Inches from my face.{&1310}\par Well, maybe not that close. But it was close enough to get me moving again. I scrambled wildly back in a rush, kicking dirt up with my hands. It sprayed into the fire, and the flames spat back.{&1310}\par "Careful!" Julian abruptly snapped, as I skidded back on the seat of my pants. "You'll put it out."{&1310}\par I just stared at him. Wide-eyed.{&1310}\par "Put it out!" I all but screeched at him. "What the hell are you doing? Trying to kill me?" Every time I thought to take an eye of him he tried to pull something new. And I was too tired for that shit anymore.{&1310}\par I hit the stony bluff of a steep hillside, bringing my hasty retreat to a halt. He just stabbed a finger at me over those flames between us, undaunted or caring.{&1310}\par "Keep your voice down," he warned with a dangerous look in his eye. "And calm down. We aren't on any station right now."{&1310}\par I stared at that fire, and I stared at him. He just poked it absently with a long stick, stirring the flames. He didn't look like he really cared at all if that stuff got loose and started burning us all. To be fair, though, I guess there were a lot less bulkheads out there. And a lot more air.{&1310}\par I looked around for Ev, and she was lying peacefully next to the fire on her back. Her chest rose and fell evenly, and her skin wasn't so milky anymore. She really did look a bit better, I had to say.{&1310}\par Eventually, I even scooted back a little toward the man's fire. It was cold out there at night.{&1310}\par "So." {&1310}\par I cleared my throat after a few awkward minutes trying to decide if it wouldn't be better to just pass out like I had last night. It sounded really, really good just then. But there was no way I was going to make it another day like that. Not without an answer or two first.{&1310}\par "Why did you, uh ... why did you come back for us?"{&1310}\par It wasn't like I was complaining. Not really. But it just seemed weird to take off like he had only to come flying back out of nowhere to save the day. But, for all I knew, he was running me through that torture just for the hell of it. Maybe he really had nothing better to do than get back at me for crashing his ship.{&1310}\par He ignored more for another minute, though. Until I made another irritating noise in his direction.{&1310}\par "Well?"{&1310}\par "Does it matter?"{&1310}\par He gave me one of those flinty-eyed, hard-edged looks I had started getting used to whenever I opened my mouth at him out of turn. Which was every time. And whenever I was lucid on our death march - enough to pay him any attention - I just got this really strong feeling that he would have rather me or him be anywhere else. I suppose I couldn't blame him. But it did make it hard not to wonder why he was even bothering in the first place.{&1310}\par "I guess not," I muttered back at him. And kept on calling him a few colorful things I'd learned from Bertram under my breath. He just glanced up at me again.{&1310}\par "I can hear you, you know."{&1310}\par "So what?" I blinked up at him. "You \i are\i0 ."{&1310}\par His lips twisted a bit into something other than a smile. Just for a moment. He kept poking at the fire.\cf2\f1 {&1310}\par }{&1310}
