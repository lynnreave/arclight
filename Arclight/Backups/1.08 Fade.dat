The bay manager gave him some room before rounding on his two dockhands.{&1310}\par "Hal?"{&1310}\par "Boss?"{&1310}\par "Go figure out what burned her up like this and shut it down," he thrust an arm back the way she must have come. "Kendrick?"{&1310}\par "Yeah?"{&1310}\par "Get back to work." {&1310}\par Both men trudged off in different directions, and Fitzpatrick came back around.{&1310}\par "I'm real sorry about this, Doc," he apologized, looking distraught. "Not sure what could have done something like this around here. Unless she got too close too one of the exhaust ports, or something."{&1310}\par Nolan didn't look at him, checking over the girl instead. "It's not your fault, Dane," he told him simply, peeling back open that ragged old brown jacket of hers to get a better look. There was a lot of scarring. Burns covered her face and hands. That raven-black hair of hers had taken the brunt of it from the skin on the back of her neck down to the shoulders where it stopped. Huge tufts had been scorched away. Then the jacket took the rest of it, pitted with ash in no few places too.{&1310}\par He looked down at that mess. And kept his face straight.{&1310}\par "What can you do for her, Thaddeus?" he asked back at the other man. He studied her broken form with a critical eye. A few seconds, and then he sighed aloud.{&1310}\par "She'll lose how it happened and everything after," he explained clinically. "Maybe a few minutes before too. There is no way to know for certain in matters like this."{&1310}\par "That's fine," Nolan told him, still not taking his eyes away. There was more to it than that, but the other would never say so. "She's better off not knowing." And they were both content to leave it at that.{&1310}\par The older man shrugged his shoulders behind, puffing out at his white beard and moustaches. He took a deep breath, settling the space around him. Then, without another word, he bent over beside Weir and put his hands on the girl.{&1310}\par Nolan waited as patiently as he could while Thaddeus closed his eyes and mumbled his supplications to the aether. Minutes passed. They dragged on, and neither man moved. Nolan only started to feel it after crouching down there on the deck long enough for his bones to ache. Things began to shift.{&1310}\par It started in her hands. Nolan watched as black, charred flesh knitted itself slowly back together. Veins popped out beneath the skin, red and angry. They crept back up her arms beneath the tattered sleeves of her jacket, muscles tensing hard behind. Her hands curled into little claws. By the time it reached her spine, her entire body was convulsing like it would tear itself apart.{&1310}\par Nolan waited. If the girl had been awake, she would have been screaming. As it was, he could all but feel the agony of it just in the watching. Thaddeus continued his channeling, brow lowered in concentration. When the burns on her neck started to slip away into clean, pink flesh once more, the old man was shivering himself. Shaking, by the time the hair that had burned away grew back in place. And Evelyn was foaming at the mouth when the old man finally collapsed.{&1310}\par Nolan turned her head aside to stop her choking. He looked back up to Thaddeus, and the old man was just barely holding himself up by his elbows against the deck to the other side of the girl. The veins were black beneath his papery flesh, and he was twitching badly. It took a long time for it to pass. For both of them.{&1310}\par "Thank you," Weir said, hugging the girl's unconscious head to him. Thaddeus might have nodded. Or convulsed again. It was hard to tell for sure.{&1310}\par By then, Hal Fengler was jogging back over toward them. He had another man in tow. That one hung back a step at the sight of Dr. Weir's daughter hanging limp and apparently lifeless, but whole now, in his arms and the Head Archivist bent over on his knees on the deck. Hal did a double-take of his own on coming back over, but he knew better than to wonder too hard at things like that on Riftwatch station.{&1310}\par "Found the hatch to the maintenance tunnels open," the man said instead, sticking a thumb back over his shoulder. "Looks like someone cracked the combo on it."{&1310}\par Nolan looked to Fitzpatrick and the bay manager bobbed his head at Fengler. "Thanks, Hal," he said. And dismissed the men. {&1310}\par He stood.{&1310}\par "I'll call the Watch Captain and have him get some boys down there to check it out."{&1310}\par "Please do, Dane," Thaddeus chimed in then, glancing up at him from under those thick, white eyebrows. It was still a struggle for him, but he managed. And when the bay manager was gone, he twisted his head aside to Nolan. That rasping voice was low, even for him.{&1310}\par "This escalated quickly, Nolan," he told the younger man. "First the message from Anders. Now an attack here in the station on the very same day." He sucked in a heady breath, still holding his face up from the ground. "Whoever did this has been waiting some time to strike."{&1310}\par "Twenty years is a long time, Thaddeus," Nolan grunted back. "But you're right. I knew things would move quickly once they did."{&1310}\par "I doubt that your enemies have merely waited all this time," the other chided him once more.{&1310}\par "No," Weir agreed. Then pushed himself and the unconscious girl along with him up from the deck. "But neither have I." He carried her back over toward where they had been preparing his shuttle, only stopping long enough to grab Evelyn's backpack. The other two bags he left with a look for Thaddeus. The older man managed a nod, and started pulling himself back up as well.{&1310}\par "Have you decided where you will go yet?" the Head Archivist asked a few minutes later, hanging near the shuttle's open hatch while Nolan moved around inside. The older man had recomposed himself for the most part. He was still bent over and looking like he could barely hold up his own weight, though. Weir glanced up, briefly.{&1310}\par "Dreggor's Door," he told the other, still entering commands and hovering over consoles. The portholes at the front of the craft opened up into empty space and the glittering Rift. "We can lose ourselves in the crowds there." It was a simple enough plan, to be sure. Thaddeus agreed.{&1310}\par "And what if they anticipate you fleeing Riftwatch at the first sign of trouble?" he probed.{&1310}\par "Doubtful," Nolan said, continuing. "They'll assume that either whatever sleeper agent they had here did the job and finished it, or that we'd be tied up worrying about her safety. Either way, they couldn't expect us to react so quickly as this." He went to work strapping the unconscious girl now into a chair beside the pilot's.{&1310}\par "You are assuming, of course," the other pressed with an arched brow, hanging on the rear hatch still, "that they are not as clever or prepared as you, Nolan. Or that they did not spend the same twenty years plotting every move the other would make when the time came," he chided. And Weir looked up at him over the girl.{&1310}\par "I know that."{&1310}\par "This might be a game, Nolan," the old man added after a moment. "But that does not mean you have to play by all the rules. Whoever has finally come for you - they probably won't."{&1310}\par The engines had started up. Nolan spent the next several moments over the pilot's console.{&1310}\par "This isn't a game at all, Thaddeus," he told the other as he finished up. "This is a war." His old fingers flew along until everything was set and marked. "There are no rules."{&1310}\par The old man left it at that. He studied Weir for a few long moments more. Then he turned away with a small, sad smile.{&1310}\par "I wish you luck, Nolan," he said then with a wave of his hand back over his shoulder as he started slowly, unsteadily away. "Take care of yourself." The rear hatch began to swing shut to a soft mechanical whine. "Do it for an old man with few friends left."{&1310}\par "Thank you," Weir told him through the shrinking hole. He did not join him in that wave. "I don't think we'll see each other again." {&1310}\par The last, the other did not hear. The hatch swallowed him up whole.{&1310}\par Nolan returned to the pilot's chair and strapped himself in. The shuttlebay port closed behind them too. It jarred the craft, and the girl in her chair. She stirred at the abruptness of it.{&1310}\par "Where are we going?" she mumbled without opening her eyes, still mostly asleep. Her fastenings kept her bound tightly in place.{&1310}\par Nolan glanced over.{&1310}\par "Somewhere safe."{&1310}\par It was all he said. She fell out of it again after that, and he turned back to the controls. The shuttle broke free, shooting forward into empty space. And they left the station behind without another thought.{&1310}\par }{&1310}

He went to work strapping the unconscious girl now into a chair.{&1310}\par "You are assuming, of course," the other pressed with an arched brow, "that they are not as clever or prepared as you, Nolan. Or that they did not spend the same twenty years plotting every move the other would make when the time came," he chided. And Weir looked up at him over the girl.{&1310}\par "I know that."{&1310}\par "I wish you luck, Nolan," Thaddeus said then with a wave of his hand beyond the rear hatch. It began to swing shut to a soft mechanical whine.{&1310}\par "Thank you," Weir told him through the shrinking hole. He did not join him in that wave. "I doubt we'll see each other again." The last, the other did not hear. The hatch had swallowed him up whole.{&1310}\par Nolan returned to the pilot's chair and strapped himself in. The shuttlebay port closed behind them too. It jarred the craft, and the girl in her chair. She stirred at the abruptness of it.{&1310}\par "Where are we going?" she mumbled without opening her eyes, still mostly asleep. Her fastenings kept her bound tightly in place.{&1310}\par Nolan glanced over.{&1310}\par "Somewhere safe."{&1310}\par It was all he said. She fell out of it again after that, and he turned back to the controls. The shuttle broke free, shooting forward into empty space. And they left the station behind.{&1310}\par }{&1310}

The bay manager gave him some room before rounding on his two dockhands.{&1310}\par "Hal?"{&1310}\par "Boss?"{&1310}\par "Go figure out what burned her up like this and shut it down," he thrust an arm back the way she must have come. "Kendrick?"{&1310}\par "Yeah?"{&1310}\par "Get back to work." {&1310}\par Both men trudged off in different directions, and Fitzpatrick came back around.{&1310}\par "I'm real sorry about this, Weir," he apologized, looking distraught. "Not sure what could have done something like this around here. Unless she got too close too one of the exhaust ports, or something."{&1310}\par Nolan didn't look at him, checking over the girl instead. "It's not your fault, Dane," he told him simply, peeling back open that ragged old brown jacket of hers to get a better look. There was a lot of scarring. Burns covered her face and hands. That raven-black hair of hers had taken the brunt of it from the skin on the back of her neck down to the shoulders where it stopped. Huge tufts had been scorched away. Then the jacket took the rest of it, pitted with ash in no few places too.{&1310}\par He looked down at that mess. And kept his face straight.{&1310}\par "What can you do for her, Thaddeus?" he asked back at the other man. He studied her broken form with a critical eye. A few seconds, and then he sighed aloud.{&1310}\par "She'll lose how it happened and everything after," he explained clinically. "Maybe a few minutes before too. There is no way to know for certain in matters like this."{&1310}\par "That's fine," Nolan told him, still not taking his eyes away. There was more to it than that, but the other would never say so. "She's better off not knowing." And they were both content to leave it at that.{&1310}\par The older man shrugged his shoulders behind, puffing out at his white beard and moustaches. He took a deep breath, settling the space around him. Then, without another word, he bent over beside Weir and put his hands on the girl.{&1310}\par Nolan waited as patiently as he could while Thaddeus closed his eyes and mumbled his supplications to the aether. Minutes passed. They dragged on, and neither man moved. Nolan only started to feel it after crouching down there on the deck long enough for his bones to ache. Things began to shift.{&1310}\par It started in her hands. Nolan watched as black, charred flesh knitted itself slowly back together. Veins popped out beneath the skin, red and angry. They crept back up her arms beneath the tattered sleeves of her jacket, muscles tensing hard behind. Her hands curled into little claws. By the time it reached her spine, her entire body was convulsing like it would tear itself apart.{&1310}\par Nolan waited. If the girl had been awake, she would have been screaming. As it was, he could all but feel the agony of it just in the watching. Thaddeus continued his appeals, brow lowered in concentration. When the burns on her neck started slip away into clean, pink flesh once more, the old man was shivering himself. Shaking, by the time the hair that had burned away grew back in place. And Evelyn was foaming at the mouth when the old man finally collapsed.{&1310}\par Nolan turned her head aside to stop her choking. He looked back up to Thaddeus, and the old man was just barely holding himself up by his elbows against the deck to the other side of the girl. The veins were black beneath his papery flesh, and he was twitching badly. It took a long time for it to pass. For both of them.{&1310}\par "Thank you," Weir said, hugging the girl's unconscious head to him. Thaddeus might have nodded. Or convulsed again. It was hard to tell for sure.{&1310}\par By then, Hal Fengler was jogging back over toward them. He had another man in tow. That one hung back a step at the sight of Nolan Weir's daughter hanging limp and apparently lifeless, but whole now, in his arms and the Head Archivist bent over on his knees on the deck. Hal did a double-take of his own on coming back over, but he knew better than to wonder too hard at things like that on Riftwatch station.{&1310}\par "Found the hatch to the maintenance tunnels open," the man said instead, sticking a thumb back over his shoulder. "Looks like someone cracked the combo on it."{&1310}\par Nolan looked to Fitzpatrick and the bay manager bobbed his head at Fengler. "Thanks, Hal," he said. And dismissed the men. {&1310}\par He stood.{&1310}\par "I'll call the Warden and have him get some boys down there to check it out."{&1310}\par "Please do, Dane," Thaddeus chimed in then, glancing up at him from under those thick, white eyebrows. It was still a struggle for him, but he managed. And when the bay manager was gone, he twisted his head aside to Nolan. That rasping voice was low, even for him.{&1310}\par "This escalated quickly, Nolan," he told the younger man. "First the message from Anders. Now an attack here in the station on the very same day." He sucked in a heady breath, still holding his face up from the ground. "Whoever did this has been waiting some time to strike."{&1310}\par "Twenty years is a long time, Thaddeus," Nolan grunted back. "But you're right. I knew things would move quickly once they did."{&1310}\par "I doubt that your enemies have merely waited all this time," the other chided him once more.{&1310}\par "No," Weir agreed. Then pushed himself and the unconscious girl along with him up from the deck. "But neither have I." He carried her back over toward where they had been preparing his shuttle, only stopping long enough to grab Evelyn backpack. The other two bags he left with a look for Thaddeus. The older man managed a nod, and started pulling himself back up as well.{&1310}\par "Have you decided where you will go yet?" the Head Archivist asked a few minutes later, hanging near the shuttle's open hatch while Nolan moved around inside. The older man had recomposed himself for the most part. He was still bent over and looking like he could barely hold up his own weight, though. Weir glanced up, briefly.{&1310}\par "Dreggor's Door," he told the other, still entering commands and hovering over consoles. The portholes at the front of the craft opened up into empty space and the glittering Rift. "We can lose ourselves in the crowds there." It was a simple enough plan, to be sure. Thaddeus agreed.{&1310}\par "And what if they anticipate you fleeing Riftwatch at the first sign of trouble?" he probed.{&1310}\par "Doubtful," Nolan said, continuing. "They'll assume that either whatever sleeper agent they had here did the job and finished it, or that we'd be tied up here worrying about her safety. Either way, they couldn't expect us to react so quickly as this." He went to work strapping the unconscious girl now into a chair beside the pilot's.{&1310}\par "You are assuming, of course," the other pressed with an arched brow, hanging on the rear hatch still, "that they are not as clever or prepared as you, Nolan.

And Weir looked up at him over the girl.{&1310}\par "I know that."{&1310}\par "This might be a game, Nolan," the old man added after a moment. "But that does not mean you must play by all the rules. Whoever has finally come for you - they will certainly not."{&1310}\par The engines had started up. Nolan spent the next several moments over the pilot's console.{&1310}\par "This isn't a game at all, Thaddeus," he told the other as he finished up. "This is a war." His old fingers flew along until everything was set and marked. "There are no rules."{&1310}\par The old man left it at that. He studied Weir for a few long moments more. Then he turned away with a small, sad smile.{&1310}\par "I wish you luck, Nolan," he said then with a wave of his hand back over his shoulder as he started slowly, unsteadily away. "Take care of yourself." The rear hatch began to swing shut to a soft mechanical whine. "Do it for an old man with few friends left."{&1310}\par "Thank you," Weir told him through the shrinking hole. He did not join him in that wave. "I doubt we'll see each other again." {&1310}\par The last, the other did not hear.

The bay manager gave him some room before rounding on his two dockhands.{&1310}\par "Hal?"{&1310}\par "Boss?"{&1310}\par "Go figure out what burned her up like this and shut it down," he thrust an arm back the way she must have come. "Kendrick?"{&1310}\par "Yeah?"{&1310}\par "Get back to work." {&1310}\par Both men trudged off in different directions, and Fitzpatrick came back around.{&1310}\par "I'm real sorry about this, Weir," he apologized, looking distraught. "Not sure what could have done something like this around here. Unless she got too close too one of the exhaust ports, or something."{&1310}\par Nolan didn't look at him, checking over the girl instead. "It's not your fault, Dane," he told him simply, peeling back open that ragged old brown jacket of hers to get a better look. There was a lot of scarring. Burns covered her face and hands. That raven-black hair of hers had taken the brunt of it from the skin on the back of her neck down to the shoulders where it stopped. Huge tufts had been scorched away. Then the jacket took the rest of it, pitted with ash in no few places too.{&1310}\par He looked down at that mess. And kept his face straight.{&1310}\par "What can you do for her, Thaddeus?" he asked back at the other man. He studied her broken form with a critical eye. A few seconds, and then he sighed aloud.{&1310}\par "She'll lose how it happened and everything after," he explained clinically. "Maybe a few minutes before too. There is no way to know for certain in matters like this."{&1310}\par "That's fine," Nolan told him, still not taking his eyes away. There was more to it than that, but the other would never say so. "She's better off not knowing." And they were both content to leave it at that.{&1310}\par The older man shrugged his shoulders behind, puffing out at his white beard and moustaches. He took a deep breath, settling the space around him. Then, without another word, he bent over beside Weir and put his hands on the girl.{&1310}\par Nolan waited as patiently as he could while Thaddeus closed his eyes and mumbled his supplications to the aether. Minutes passed. They dragged on, and neither man moved. Nolan only started to feel it after crouching down there on the deck long enough for his bones to ache. Things began to shift.{&1310}\par It started in her hands. Nolan watched as black, charred flesh knitted itself slowly back together. Veins popped out beneath the skin, red and angry. They crept back up her arms beneath the tattered sleeves of her jacket, muscles tensing hard behind. Her hands curled into little claws. By the time it reached her spine, her entire body was convulsing like it would tear itself apart.{&1310}\par Nolan waited. If the girl had been awake, she would have been screaming. As it was, he could all but feel the agony of it just in the watching. Thaddeus continued his appeals, brow lowered in concentration. When the burns on her neck started slip away into clean, pink flesh once more, the old man was shivering himself. Shaking, by the time the hair that had burned away grew back in place. And Evelyn was foaming at the mouth when the old man finally collapsed.{&1310}\par Nolan turned her head aside to stop her choking. He looked back up to Thaddeus, and the old man was just barely holding himself up by his elbows against the deck to the other side of the girl. The veins were black beneath his papery flesh, and he was twitching badly. It took a long time for it to pass. For both of them.{&1310}\par "Thank you," Weir said, hugging the girl's unconscious head to him. Thaddeus might have nodded. Or convulsed again. It was hard to tell for sure.{&1310}\par By then, Hal Fengler was jogging back over toward them. He had another man in tow. That one hung back a step at the sight of Nolan Weir's daughter hanging limp and apparently lifeless, but whole now, in his arms and the Head Archivist bent over on his knees on the deck. Hal did a double-take of his own on coming back over, but he knew better than to wonder too hard at things like that on Riftwatch station.{&1310}\par "Found the hatch to the maintenance tunnels open," the man said instead, sticking a thumb back over his shoulder. "Looks like someone cracked the combo on it."{&1310}\par Nolan looked to Fitzpatrick and the bay manager bobbed his head at Fengler. "Thanks, Hal," he said. And dismissed the men. {&1310}\par He stood.{&1310}\par "I'll call the Warden and have him get some boys down there to check it out."{&1310}\par "Please do, Dane," Thaddeus chimed in then, glancing up at him from under those thick, white eyebrows. It was still a struggle for him, but he managed. And when the bay manager was gone, he twisted his head aside to Nolan. That rasping voice was low, even for him.{&1310}\par "This escalated quickly, Nolan," he told the younger man. "First the message from Anders. Now an attack here in the station on the very same day." He sucked in a heady breath, still holding his face up from the ground. "Whoever did this has been waiting some time to strike."{&1310}\par "Twenty years is a long time, Thaddeus," Nolan grunted back. "But you're right. I knew things would move quickly once they did."{&1310}\par "I doubt that your enemies have merely waited all this time," the other chided him once more.{&1310}\par "No," Weir agreed. Then pushed himself and the unconscious girl along with him up from the deck. "But neither have I." He carried her back over toward where they had been preparing his shuttle, only stopping long enough to grab Evelyn backpack. The other two bags he left with a look for Thaddeus. The older man managed a nod, and started pulling himself back up as well.{&1310}\par "Have you decided where you will go yet?" the Head Archivist asked a few minutes later, hanging near the shuttle's open hatch while Nolan moved around inside. The older man had recomposed himself for the most part. He was still bent over and looking like he could barely hold up his own weight, though. Weir glanced up, briefly.{&1310}\par "Dreggor's Door," he told the other, still entering commands and hovering over consoles. The portholes at the front of the craft opened up into empty space and the glittering Rift. "We can lose ourselves in the crowds there." It was a simple enough plan, to be sure. Thaddeus agreed.{&1310}\par "And what if they anticipate you fleeing Riftwatch at the first sign of trouble?" he probed.{&1310}\par "Doubtful," Nolan said, continuing. "They'll assume that either whatever sleeper agent they had here did the job and finished it, or that we'd be tied up here worrying about her safety. Either way, they couldn't expect us to react so quickly as this." He went to work strapping the unconscious girl now into a chair beside the pilot's.{&1310}\par "You are assuming, of course," the other pressed with an arched brow, hanging on the rear hatch still, "that they are not as clever or prepared as you, Nolan. Or that they did not spend the same twenty years plotting every move the other would make when the time came," he chided. And Weir looked up at him over the girl.{&1310}\par "I know that."{&1310}\par "This might be a game, Nolan," the old man added after a moment. "But that does not mean you must play by all the rules. Whoever has finally come for you - they will certainly not."{&1310}\par The engines had started up. Nolan spent the next several moments over the pilot's console.{&1310}\par "This isn't a game at all, Thaddeus," he told the other as he finished up. "This is a war." His old fingers flew along until everything was set and marked. "There are no rules."{&1310}\par The old man left it at that. He studied Weir for a few long moments more. Then he turned away with a small, sad smile.{&1310}\par "I wish you luck, Nolan," he said then with a wave of his hand back over his shoulder as he started slowly, unsteadily away. "Take care of yourself." The rear hatch began to swing shut to a soft mechanical whine. "Do it for an old man with few friends left."{&1310}\par "Thank you," Weir told him through the shrinking hole. He did not join him in that wave. "I doubt we'll see each other again." {&1310}\par The last, the other did not hear. The hatch swallowed him up whole.{&1310}\par Nolan returned to the pilot's chair and strapped himself in. The shuttlebay port closed behind them too. It jarred the craft, and the girl in her chair. She stirred at the abruptness of it.{&1310}\par "Where are we going?" she mumbled without opening her eyes, still mostly asleep. Her fastenings kept her bound tightly in place.{&1310}\par Nolan glanced over.{&1310}\par "Somewhere safe."{&1310}\par It was all he said. She fell out of it again after that, and he turned back to the controls. The shuttle broke free, shooting forward into empty space. And they left the station behind.{&1310}\par }{&1310}

There is no way to know for certain in matters like this."{&1310}\par "That's fine," Nolan told him, still not taking his eyes away. There was more to it than that, but the other would never say so. "She's better off not knowing." And they were both content to leave it at that.{&1310}\par The older man shrugged his shoulders behind, puffing out at his white beard and moustaches. He took a deep breath, settling the space around him. Then, without another word, he bent over beside Weir and put his hands on the girl.{&1310}\par Nolan waited as patiently as he could while Thaddeus closed his eyes and mumbled his supplications to the aether. Minutes passed. They dragged on, and neither man moved. Nolan only started to feel it after crouching down there on the deck long enough for his bones to ache. Things began to shift.{&1310}\par It started in her hands. Nolan watched as black, charred flesh knitted itself slowly back together. Veins popped out beneath the skin, red and angry. They crept back up her arms beneath the tattered sleeves of her jacket, muscles tensing hard behind. Her hands curled into little claws. By the time it reached her spine, her entire body was convulsing like it would tear itself apart.{&1310}\par Nolan waited. If the girl had been awake, she would have been screaming. As it was, he could all but feel the agony of it just in the watching. Thaddeus continued his channeling, brow lowered in concentration. When the burns on her neck started to slip away into clean, pink flesh once more, the old man was shivering himself. Shaking, by the time the hair that had burned away grew back in place. And Evelyn was foaming at the mouth when the old man finally collapsed.{&1310}\par Nolan turned her head aside to stop her choking. He looked back up to Thaddeus, and the old man was just barely holding himself up by his elbows against the deck to the other side of the girl. The veins were black beneath his papery flesh, and he was twitching badly. It took a long time for it to pass. For both of them.{&1310}\par "Thank you," Weir said, hugging the girl's unconscious head to him. Thaddeus might have nodded. Or convulsed again. It was hard to tell for sure.{&1310}\par By then, Hal Fengler was jogging back over toward them. He had another man in tow. That one hung back a step at the sight of Dr. Weir's daughter hanging limp and apparently lifeless, but whole now, in his arms and the Head Archivist bent over on his knees on the deck. Hal did a double-take of his own on coming back over, but he knew better than to wonder too hard at things like that on Riftwatch station.{&1310}\par "Found the hatch to the maintenance tunnels open," the man said instead, sticking a thumb back over his shoulder. "Looks like someone cracked the combo on it."{&1310}\par Nolan looked to Fitzpatrick and the bay manager bobbed his head at Fengler. "Thanks, Hal," he said. And dismissed the men. {&1310}\par He stood.{&1310}\par "I'll call the Watch Captain and have him get some boys down there to check it out."{&1310}\par "Please do, Dane," Thaddeus chimed in then, glancing up at him from under those thick, white eyebrows. It was still a struggle for him, but he managed. And when the bay manager was gone, he twisted his head aside to Nolan. That rasping voice was low, even for him.{&1310}\par "This escalated quickly, Nolan," he told the younger man. "First the message from Anders. Now an attack here in the station on the very same day." He sucked in a heady breath, still holding his face up from the ground. "Whoever did this has been waiting some time to strike."{&1310}\par "Twenty years is a long time, Thaddeus," Nolan grunted back. "But you're right. I knew things would move quickly once they did."{&1310}\par "I doubt that your enemies have merely waited all this time," the other chided him once more.{&1310}\par "No," Weir agreed. Then pushed himself and the unconscious girl along with him up from the deck. "But neither have I." He carried her back over toward where they had been preparing his shuttle, only stopping long enough to grab Evelyn's backpack. The other two bags he left with a look for Thaddeus. The older man managed a nod, and started pulling himself back up as well.{&1310}\par "Have you decided where you will go yet?" the Head Archivist asked a few minutes later, hanging near the shuttle's open hatch while Nolan moved around inside. The older man had recomposed himself for the most part. He was still bent over and looking like he could barely hold up his own weight, though. Weir glanced up, briefly.{&1310}\par "Dreggor's Door," he told the other, still entering commands and hovering over consoles. The portholes at the front of the craft opened up into empty space and the glittering Rift. "We can lose ourselves in the crowds there." It was a simple enough plan, to be sure. Thaddeus agreed.{&1310}\par "And what if they anticipate you fleeing Riftwatch at the first sign of trouble?" he probed.{&1310}\par "Doubtful," Nolan said, continuing. "They'll assume that either whatever sleeper agent they had here did the job and finished it, or that we'd be tied up worrying about her safety. Either way, they couldn't expect us to react so quickly as this." He went to work strapping the unconscious girl now into a chair beside the pilot's.{&1310}\par "You are assuming, of course," the other pressed with an arched brow, hanging on the rear hatch still, "that they are not as clever or prepared as you, Nolan. Or that they did not spend the same twenty years plotting every move the other would make when the time came," he chided. And Weir looked up at him over the girl.{&1310}\par "I know that."{&1310}\par "This might be a game, Nolan," the old man added after a moment. "But that does not mean you have to play by all the rules. Whoever has finally come for you - they probably won't."{&1310}\par The engines had started up. Nolan spent the next several moments over the pilot's console.{&1310}\par "This isn't a game at all, Thaddeus," he told the other as he finished up. "This is a war." His old fingers flew along until everything was set and marked. "There are no rules."{&1310}\par The old man left it at that. He studied Weir for a few long moments more. Then he turned away with a small, sad smile.{&1310}\par "I wish you luck, Nolan," he said then with a wave of his hand back over his shoulder as he started slowly, unsteadily away. "Take care of yourself." The rear hatch began to swing shut to a soft mechanical whine. "Do it for an old man with few friends left."{&1310}\par "Thank you," Weir told him through the shrinking hole. He did not join him in that wave. "I don't think we'll see each other again." {&1310}\par The last, the other did not hear. The hatch swallowed him up whole.{&1310}\par Nolan returned to the pilot's chair and strapped himself in. The shuttlebay port closed behind them too. It jarred the craft, and the girl in her chair. She stirred at the abruptness of it.{&1310}\par "Where are we going?" she mumbled without opening her eyes, still mostly asleep. Her fastenings kept her bound tightly in place.{&1310}\par Nolan glanced over.{&1310}\par "Somewhere safe."{&1310}\par It was all he said. She fell out of it again after that, and he turned back to the controls. The shuttle broke free, shooting forward into empty space. And they left the station behind without another thought.{&1310}\par }{&1310}

The bay manager gave him some room before rounding on his two dockhands.{&1310}\par "Hal?"{&1310}\par "Boss?"{&1310}\par "Go figure out what burned her up like this and shut it down," he thrust an arm back the way she must have come. "Kendrick?"{&1310}\par "Yeah?"{&1310}\par "Get back to work." {&1310}\par Both men trudged off in different directions, and Fitzpatrick came back around.{&1310}\par "I'm real sorry about this, Doc," he apologized, looking distraught. "Not sure what could have done something like this around here. Unless she got too close too one of the exhaust ports, or something."{&1310}\par Nolan didn't look at him, checking over the girl instead. "It's not your fault, Dane," he told him simply, peeling back open that ragged old brown jacket of hers to get a better look. There was a lot of scarring. Burns covered her face and hands. That raven-black hair of hers had taken the brunt of it from the skin on the back of her neck down to the shoulders where it stopped. Huge tufts had been scorched away. Then the jacket took the rest of it, pitted with ash in no few places too.{&1310}\par He looked down at that mess. And kept his face straight.{&1310}\par "What can you do for her, Thaddeus?" he asked back at the other man. He studied her broken form with a critical eye.
