Inside the cabin.{&1310}\par At first, I had no idea what was going on. I jerked right up out of that narrow bunk wedged into one side of the shuttle, wide-eyed, and gasping aloud. I had seen enough vids to be disappointed realizing I had done the stupidest thing I could. And I froze there with a scrap of a sheet clutched to my chest, just waiting for someone to put a hole through me.{&1310}\par But it was just me.

My eyes finally lost their terrified glaze and whipped about the cabin as I ducked under the safety of the sheet for cover.

Awake. Pale and sweating, still. She had a gun in one hand had it pointed at the rear hatch. And she was firing. Over, and over.{&1310}\par She must have heard me scream, but you couldn't tell. I don't know how long I just sat there staring at her - horrified, and paralyzed. It felt surreal, like a dream. My heart beat at my chest like a hammer, though, and I waited for the bone to crack.{&1310}\par I didn't say anything when I got my will back. I didn't warn my best friend. I just slipped down to the deck and pounced on her like a cat.{&1310}\par The gun stopped going off after that. I wrestled it from her, even though it took a minute because she refused to give it up despite how weak she was. And feverish too. She didn't even look at me, but kept whispering over and over, "It was right there. It was right \i there\i0 ." I managed to get her back down and she passed out. And then I was left with the awkward question of where the hell she had gotten a gun from.{&1310}\par I made it through the rest of the night without incident. Mostly because I didn't sleep. I just kept thinking about what Ev had said, what I had seen yesterday, and the blood in those pods. Nothing was behind me by the time I had made it back to the shuttle, no matter how hard I looked, and I could almost convince myself I'd imagined it. Too bad I wasn't that stupid.{&1310}\par It was a long time before I could open the rear hatch, even after the sun came back and beat down on it from outside. It wasn't that I was scared - not really. I just wasn't about to take any chances. Not with Ev sitting there still looking like death, right?{&1310}\par Right.{&1310}\par I kept her gun safe with me. It made me feel just a little bit better when I finally did go outside, and I really didn't want her trying to get me killed by using it again. Not that I knew how to use the thing any better than she did. I just stuck it out in front of me and hoped pulling that trigger would do most of the work for me.{&1310}\par A few tentative sweeps with the pistol from the safety of the open hatch, though, and the clearing was still as calm and quiet as it had been since I landed. Maybe even a little quieter. That familiar gust hit almost immediately, and the leaves were still rustling by the thousands. Anything else? I tried to listen for any of those birds or other animals to be sure. It seemed like the thing to do.{&1310}\par There might not have been any. It was hard to tell, and I really didn't know any better. But I tried really hard. And something screamed in my ear.{&1310}\par The gun when off. Bolts of fire shrieked back, slicing into bark and bursting apart fistfulls of dirt in the ground as I tumbled backwards and fell over flat on my ass. A few more popped off before stopped pulling. Too bad nothing came rushing at me out of the woods.{&1310}\par The distress beacon lit up in a fury from where it stood alone away from the shuttle. That red light flared and blared a warning siren loud enough to sound like we should have been under attack. And maybe we were, because something large abruptly flew by overhead.{&1310}\par Just a glimpse of shadow. It blocked out the sun for just long enough to sweep over above me and the trees. I twisted back around on the ground and only got an eyeful of blinding sun for it. Then I was stuck there trying to blink black spots out of them.{&1310}\par I guess I had fumbled the gun in all the excitement, because it wasn't in my hand when I tried to fire it again. The howl of that huge something flying overhead started to come back and drown out the beacon as I scrambled there on the ground for it. And by the time I finally found it and my eyes cleared up again, that thing was hovering just overhead.{&1310}\par Scarred metal blotted out the sky above and that dimming whitewash turned to shadow instead. I stared at it with the gun in my hand for a few seconds. Then it started to descend. By the time it folded in on itself and I saw those wings for what they were, I jumped back to my feet.
