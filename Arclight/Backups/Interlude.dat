It might have been night, or it might have been day - everyone left had given up on figuring that out some time ago, along with everything else. It didn't seem so important anymore. Not with the way anyone slow, dazed, or unlucky enough to do so didn't last very long anyways.{&1310}\par How long had it been?{&1310}\par Days?{&1310}\par Weeks?{&1310}\par It was one, long endless night in the dark. The air was thick, and damp, and it felt claustrophobic out there amongst the dead trees and the vanished dead even though the forest went on forever. If there really had ever been an original mission statement - it had said two days. Two days from the LOD outside the drop point.{&1310}\par It had been at least two days since they'd lost Ericks.{&1310}\par There was light enough, anyway -  if a man felt like risking it. The problem was that it always attracted something much worse than the dark. They'd found that out quickly enough in those first few hours on the move.{&1310}\par Light discipline.{&1310}\par That was what LT had called for soon after Dowager had lit up a match off in the bush and got himself swallowed whole before anyone else knew what happened. The rest of his team too, when they went flying off after him in a rush with lights. Gone without a trace. At least, the ones who'd been carrying flashlights. Only Briggs had been left - shivering and traumatized by himself in the dark. Whatever got them, they'd snatched another guy away right next him. He was the only one without a light.{&1310}\par And covered in the rest of the guys' blood.{&1310}\par LT figured it out real quick. He had that idea anyways. A smart guy, Lieutenant Fletcher. And right about one thing, at least. They didn't lose anymore for a while after that. So it must have proved his point.{&1310}\par Fletcher tried to get the captain up on the horn after that while we held position with as close to three-sixty security as we could get, spread out in the black woods. No luck, though. Some kind of communications blackout, maybe. Odd that it would happen so quickly on a covert search and destroy op. But it did. And all that poor bastard holding the comm link got for his trouble was to be the next one dragged off into the dark.{&1310}\par They were supposed to keep fire discipline too. Weapons were loaded, but any live fire would have given them away. Between third team's sudden vanishing act to a chorus of terrified screams, no communications, and a corporal carrying a transmitter snatched up right in front of them - it wasn't much of a surprise when the remaining guys cut lose. They tore up the trees with rifle fire. {&1310}\par A lesser outfit might have completely lost it.{&1310}\par They were on the move constantly after that. Eventually, men stopped caring about noise and giving away their positions as they rushed headlong through the dead wood. Second squad disintegrated into wild fireteams that got lost assaulting shadows after those things got the lieutenant. And Sergeant Winters didn't last long with first squad once the clicking started. Third squad learned to run at that sound quickly enough. It didn't take a dozen men getting slaughtered without a damn thing they could do about it to teach them that.{&1310}\par They'd run after that - what was left of third squad. And they'd been on the run ever since. If there was a Hell, this certainly seemed like the right place to Brennan.{&1310}\par Two days.{&1310}\par Maybe.{&1310}\par But it was hard to tell there in that dark.{&1310}\par Liam stirred to one side of him, the sound of the other man shifting so abrupt that the breath caught in Brennan's throat. Liam flexed cold, rigid hands on the stock of his rifle. He slept with it on top of him. Most of them did.{&1310}\par "How long?" the man whispered as quietly as he could, voice scratching and groggy from too little sleep.{&1310}\par "Twenty - twenty five minutes," Brennan murmured back. He squinted down at his timepiece, but the numbers still ran together in the dark. He could never be sure. And he didn't dare flick on the light. It didn't matter enough. He took to counting the seconds to pass time and keep awake.{&1310}\par "You've got another five," he offered the other man, for what it was worth. Liam didn't say anything. He just lay there completely still with his eyes open like a corpse.{&1310}\par Brennan wondered how much farther it was to the extraction point. Whatever the import of that mission to whoever authorized it from on high, it had ended in failure as far as what was left of second platoon was concerned. It fell apart in the kind of ambush in an alien environment that he could only have nightmares about. If he survived. If any of them survived.{&1310}\par All that was left now was to get the hell out of there.{&1310}\par Five minutes later, and Brennan was putting a careful hand on Drake to wake him up when the guy nearly took his hand off with a knife. He reeled back out of reach and started to spit something angry back down at the other man when that one just as abruptly froze.{&1310}\par "Did you hear that?"{&1310}\par Brennan stopped too.{&1310}\par "What was it?"{&1310}\par "I can hear them," Drake hissed after a second, squinting his eyes almost shut. He tapped a finger to the side of his skull.{&1310}\par "Inside my head!"{&1310}\par They got the rest of them up in cascading fashion with each man waking another until all were moving again.  Half an hour of sleep every couple hours for days now. Ration bars and the abundance of water every man always carried in his rucksack. That wasn't the problem. It was the fact that they had to stop at all.{&1310}\par People vanished when they did.{&1310}\par "Breen," was all Shawn said when Brennan found him crouching in the dirt where the missing man had been. That brought them down to six now. From a full complement of over forty men.{&1310}\par They found water later that day. A stagnant-looking river of black that cut into their path. Nothing drinkable, of course. But it was a welcome landmark in the middle of nowhere. Brennan had gotten enough of a look at the tactical maps before drop-off to know they could follow it right to the extraction point. That good news put an urgency in almost everyone's step.{&1310}\par They lost Drake an hour or so later, and decided not to sleep at all after that until they were clear. By the time he woke up again, Brennan thought he knew just what the man had meant about them being inside his head.{&1310}\par }{&1310}
