And on the station, at least. Somehow. Luck? I hadn't gotten myself spaced.{&1310}\par The pilot's chair was at an angle to the top of the cockpit -- now crushed against the floor -- and my hair was hanging down to the deck that was peeking up through huge tears in the hull below. Debris was all over the place, pops of sparks going off all around the wreck like the shuttle's rattling final breaths before complete death. I put a hand to the ground and used the other one to undo the restraints on my chair. They wouldn't come undone with the release and I had to find that knife again where it had fallen -- \i just \i0 in reach -- on the floor so I could cut myself free. And then I nearly landed on top of it and gutted myself as I abruptly broke out and flopped sideways down into the wrecked hull. I had time to wonder about whether or not this thing had maybe had an ejection command I should have used instead while I lay there on the flat of the blade with the wind knocked out of me. Used \i before\i0  we'd landed face down on the station, that is.{&1310}\par Breaking through the shields must have ripped open the shuttle, which made it much easier to crawl my way out. Really, I was lucky those bay shields hadn't just pulverised me in the first place. And that I'd hit the bay instead of the station hull. And that they'd acted more like a speed bump while crashing headfirst into this place than a barrier. I guess I knew firsthand whether or not a shuttle could survive crashing into the station's shields at least. You know, in case anyone ever wanted to know.{&1310}\par When I finally got to standing up inside the docking bay proper outside, I started to feel how badly banged up I really was -- which really wasn't much, considering I'd just rammed a shuttle into the station. I had more scratches than I could count, especially fresh ones on my arms from low-crawling out of the wreck, and what felt like bruised ribs and hips and shoulders and -- \i everyhere\i0  ... But it was that hole in my stomach that stung the most. I couldn't get a good look at it now with the suit on, and I'd been in too much of a hurry back in that airlock to even think about it then. So I couldn't tell how deep it was, but I pressed some fingers gingerly to the spot and felt the fabric of my undershirt stick to flesh underneath like blood had soaked through. I didn't \i feel\i0  like I was bleeding to death, but thinking about it made me suddenly feel lightheaded.{&1310}\par I fought with nausea for a few seconds, stumbling and limping further into the docking bay. Somehow, I was alone. A few other shuttles lay motionless at other ends of the bay in various states of preparation but ... no people. The dull sounds of station klaxons were all I heard, echoing dully around the bay.{&1310}\par That pistol I'd stolen from the woman on the shuttle was in one hand now, the marine's combat knife in the other. I fumbled to tuck them both in the utility belt of the space suit I was still wearing without a faceplate in place while I staggered off toward an emergency medical station, fighting off the urge to vomit there on the floor. That desperate escape caught up with me in a rush now that adrenaline was dying down and I had to fight off my body just wanting to collapse in a heap on the deck too. It would've been easy to lie down, pass out, and wait for someone else to do the rescuing. It would've been easy ... if I was sure there'd even \i be\i0  a station tomorrow. And if I didn't suddenly feel like something terrible wasn't about to burst into the shuttle bay at any second.{&1310}\par I managed to get to the EMS and found a few stims for small wounds, and a local anesthetic. They'd made us practice some mundane details of field triage back at the academy, but nothing too involved. First things first, I ended up ripping open the suit at the collar to get at my side and finally got a look at the wound. The shirt \i was\i0  soaked through like I had thought,  and I stared at it with a vague sense of despair at first. Desperation gave me enough courage to overcome my hatred of syringes, though, so I only hesitated for a few seconds at most before stabbing those injectors in my side near the wound. I tried not to think about it as I pushed down on the plungers. But I was on the floor abruptly after I was done, head feeling stuffed so full of nothing that I couldn't have stood up straight. Even so, the pain was melting away.{&1310}\par It took a minute, but my head cleared. God, I hated needles. I pulled myself back up and dug into the medical supplies again for some body gauze and managed to get my stomach clumsily wrapped up so I wouldn't just end up bleeding out eventually anyways, even though if it had been that bad it probably would've already killed me by now.{&1310}\par Now ...{&1310}\par Now that I wasn't being chased by flesh-eating monsters, choked to death by vacuum, or hunted by ... by -- \i whoever\i0  it was that wanted me to get to dad -- now ... I finally had time to take stock of the situation.{&1310}\par The station was under attack. Obviously. By pirates or Tau? It only mattered a little. Dad was still alive. \i Okay\i0 . He was trying to find me, so I should find him first. My wrist comm was busted from that guy punching it, though, so I needed a comm linkup. This room might not stay empty or unnoticed forever either and there \i were\i0  boarders on the station. I didn't know how many or what state security was in so I couldn't just stay here. I needed to move, but the thoroughfares were probably just as dangerous as anywhere right now. Maybe more so depending on what this was all about, which I, of course, had no idea about at all.{&1310}\par Oh my god what about Tess?{&1310}\par What had happened to Tess? I had \i no\i0  idea. Dad was alive, sure, but it's not like my best friend was psychokinetic or I had a comm that wasn't broken she could reach me on. The thought that she might be dead suddenly froze me in place and made my blood run cold.{&1310}\par There was a comm station nearby for the bay operators and I practically charged the thing. At first, the terminal wouldn't even come up because it said it was in "Emergency Mode" and access was restricted. But my panicked brain knew enough to hit the emergency communications button to get past that. And then I-{&1310}\par "Shit. \i Shit\i0 !"{&1310}\par I couldn't remember Tess's comm ID number. {&1310}\par I didn't know it off the top of my head! I'd -- I'd had it on quickcall for so long and I'd dialed her up manually ever since and my comm had \i never\i0  been broken before -- I was so careful about those things -- but I ... I ...{&1310}\par I'd been through only god really knew what in the last twenty-four hours trying to stay alive and get the hell out of that nightmare I'd woken up in. And now the station was being attacked. Our \i home\i0  was being attacked. Who even knew what Tess had gone through in all that time?{&1310}\par It was like running right into a brick wall. I was starting to tear up, and I had to swipe at my eyes and breathe to get myself back under control. I had to think. Think, think, think -- \i think\i0 ! It had been years but ... I'd memorized it once. If I could just remember ...{&1310}\par But I only got a few numbers in before I wasn't sure of \i anything \i0 being real or if I just made it up to fill in the memory. I pounded my fists into the comms, and the screen fizzled and warped.{&1310}\par \i God damnit, Tess! If you hadn't hacked your own comm out of the system registry in the first place -- this wouldn't be a fucking problem right now!\i0 {&1310}\par For once, I fucking wished that station security had caught on to her. Or that I hadn't helped keep her fucking secret. Or that her \i fucking\i0  comm was in the \i fucking\i0  registry!{&1310}\par "DAMN IT!"{&1310}\par I slumped against the terminal, not caring at how it suddenly glitched up. I wanted to take the pistol and just shoot the thing like it would make the problem go away. Maybe it would. I considered it.{&1310}\par No.{&1310}\par \i Damn it, Tess, if you're dead I'll\i0  ...{&1310}\par \i I'll\i0  ...{&1310}\par Do nothing? What could I do? What could \i anyone\i0  do?{&1310}\par It was partway through just falling apart there feeling sorry for myself and miserable that I realized that I could just call someone else who had a working comm with Tess on it. Dad wouldn't have had it -- he'd stopped paying attention to who I hung out with years ago. But ... Bertram.{&1310}\par Bertram!{&1310}\par I straightened up and did a search for Bertram. \i He \i0 was in the system. \i He\i0  hadn't tried to covertly take himself out so he could mess around with people's private correspondence or low-level classified files. \i He\i0  had a bar that he needed to keep known and advertised.{&1310}\par I got Bertram's ID out of the registry and called him up on the emergency feed.{&1310}\par It took a long time to go through. \i Too\i0  long. And I had to check the nearest bay doors a few times while I waited, thinking I might have heard something out there over the sounds of the klaxons. It made me pull that pistol back out just in case.{&1310}\par "Evie?"{&1310}\par I whipped back around at that abrupt sound of my name and found myself looking at a familiar, pudgy face.{&1310}\par For a second, I was so relieved and excited and overwhelmed by the actual sight of someone I knew and cared about -- even over an emergency terminal -- that I forget what I was going to say. I felt like I'd been lost in another world for days -- \i week\i0 s -- alone, and without anyone. Lost. And I just stared dumbly at that old man with wide eyes about to tear up and let loose again before I could stop them.{&1310}\par "Evie?" he tried again.{&1310}\par "Y-yes," I managed to choke out, my voice suddenly thick and hoarse in my own ears. "I'm here, Bertram. It's me!"{&1310}\par "You look terrible, Evie, are you alright?"{&1310}\par "Yeah ... I'm -- I'm fine," I lied. I didn't want to talk about myself or where I'd been so I cut right into it first. "Bertram, where's Tess? Is she okay?"{&1310}\par There was the distant echo of small arms fire and my body twisted back around toward the bay behind me instantly. The gun was up and pointing wildly at everything that stood out as I quickly scanned the room again. But it wasn't here. It wasn't on my end.{&1310}\par "Evie!"{&1310}\par I spun right back around.{&1310}\par "Bertram?"{&1310}\par The old man crouched down -- I could only tell by the outline of the scene behind him since he was talking into his wrist comm, not a terminal. And, for the first time, I saw the haggard lines on his face, the ash on his forehead, and trace of blood down one cheek from a gash opened up across his temple. People were yelling in the background and they could have been soldiers. He might have been in his bar, but there was no way to tell from here. I'd just assumed everything was as it always had been when I'd first seen him. I was so very wrong.{&1310}\par "Evie, listen to me," he coughed out, and spat as smoke filled the air and the terminal image. "I don't know where Tess is, but you've gotta get yerself somewhere safe ... You're fath--"{&1310}\par An explosion.{&1310}\par The station reverberated around Bertram and black smoke poured over his comm, obscuring him from me. He cut off and all I could hear was his wheezing breath somewhere in the smog, then him trying to cough up a lung.{&1310}\par "Bertram--?"{&1310}\par The feed cut out abruptly, and I was left with a blank terminal sporting only the Dreggoran Navy ensignia staring back at me. I hadn't realized it until just then but my face was only centimeters from the screen. And that was all I could do for a few minutes -- stare.{&1310}\par Bertram had said he didn't know where Tess was. He'd barely gotten a chance to say anything at \i all\i0  before that blast had cut him off. It had sounded like fighting. Was he even at his bar? Where was Tess? Did she even know that her adopted father could have been dead right now for all I knew?{&1310}\par That thought stopped me cold.{&1310}\par \i Bertram \i0 ...{&1310}\par I had to get to them. I had to \i find\i0  them.{&1310}\par Now.{&1310}\par I had stared at that screen for too long without doing anything. By the time I reached out again it had locked up. And when I tried to load up another emergency feed and find someone else, the lights dimmed in the middle of it until they were gone and I was in darkness.{&1310}\par Panic froze me. For a moment, I was back in that dead research tower with those things all around me. I could \i hear\i0  one of them chewing on a corpse somewhere behind me in the dark and I turned around. Slowly.{&1310}\par The pistol was in my hand, shaking wildly though I couldn't see it. I raised it at that noise. Slowly. So slowly. Somehow, I was sure it was useless and would do nothing. Somehow, I knew I was already dead and pulling the trigger would just make it happen faster.{&1310}\par I couldn't fight. I couldn't run.{&1310}\par I was dead.{&1310}\par Then the lights came back on.{&1310}\par Power returned in a kick and a whirl, bringing the whole bay back to life in a sputtering gasp.{&1310}\par Someone was standing there.{&1310}\par The gun went off on its own. On reflex. My hand fired at that thing before my brain could even catch up with it.{&1310}\par Except it wasn't one of those monsters crouching there, mindlessly devouring some dead person's body.{&1310}\par It was Mills.\cf2\highlight0\f1 {&1310}\par }{&1310}

And on the station, at least. Somehow. Luck? I hadn't gotten myself spaced.{&1310}\par The pilot's chair was at an angle to the top of the cockpit -- now crushed against the floor -- and my hair was hanging down to the deck that was peeking up through huge tears in the hull below. Debris was all over the place, pops of sparks going off all around the wreck like the shuttle's rattling final breaths before complete death. I put a hand to the ground and used the other one to undo the restraints on my chair. They wouldn't come undone with the release and I had to find that knife again where it had fallen -- \i just \i0 in reach -- on the floor so I could cut myself free. And then I nearly landed on top of it and gutted myself as I abruptly broke out and flopped sideways down into the wrecked hull. I had time to wonder about whether or not this thing had maybe had an ejection command I should have used instead while I lay there on the flat of the blade with the wind knocked out of me. Used \i before\i0  we'd landed face down on the station, that is.{&1310}\par Breaking through the shields must have ripped open the shuttle, which made it much easier to crawl my way out. Really, I was lucky those bay shields hadn't just pulverised me in the first place. And that I'd hit the bay instead of the station hull. And that they'd acted more like a speed bump while crashing headfirst into this place than a barrier. I guess I knew firsthand whether or not a shuttle could survive crashing into the station's shields at least. You know, in case anyone ever wanted to know.{&1310}\par When I finally got to standing up inside the docking bay proper outside, I started to feel how badly banged up I really was -- which really wasn't much, considering I'd just rammed a shuttle into the station. I had more scratches than I could count, especially fresh ones on my arms from low-crawling out of the wreck, and what felt like bruised ribs and hips and shoulders and -- \i everyhere\i0  ... But it was that hole in my stomach that stung the most. I couldn't get a good look at it now with the suit on, and I'd been in too much of a hurry back in that airlock to even think about it then. So I couldn't tell how deep it was, but I pressed some fingers gingerly to the spot and felt the fabric of my undershirt stick to flesh underneath like blood had soaked through. I didn't \i feel\i0  like I was bleeding to death, but thinking about it made me suddenly feel lightheaded.{&1310}\par I fought with nausea for a few seconds, stumbling and limping further into the docking bay. Somehow, I was alone. A few other shuttles lay motionless at other ends of the bay in various states of preparation but ... no people. The dull sounds of station klaxons were all I heard, echoing dully around the bay.{&1310}\par That pistol I'd stolen from the woman on the shuttle was in one hand now, the marine's combat knife in the other. I fumbled to tuck them both in the utility belt of the space suit I was still wearing without a faceplate in place while I staggered off toward an emergency medical station, fighting off the urge to vomit there on the floor. That desperate escape caught up with me in a rush now that adrenaline was dying down and I had to fight off my body just wanting to collapse in a heap on the deck too. It would've been easy to lie down, pass out, and wait for someone else to do the rescuing. It would've been easy ... if I was sure there'd even \i be\i0  a station tomorrow. And if I didn't suddenly feel like something terrible wasn't about to burst into the shuttle bay at any second.{&1310}\par I managed to get to the EMS and found a few stims for small wounds, and a local anesthetic. They'd made us practice some mundane details of field triage back at the academy, but nothing too involved. First things first, I ended up ripping open the suit at the collar to get at my side and finally got a look at the wound. The shirt \i was\i0  soaked through like I had thought,  and I stared at it with a vague sense of despair at first. Desperation gave me enough courage to overcome my hatred of syringes, though, so I only hesitated for a few seconds at most before stabbing those injectors in my side near the wound. I tried not to think about it as I pushed down on the plungers. But I was on the floor abruptly after I was done, head feeling stuffed so full of nothing that I couldn't have stood up straight. Even so, the pain was melting away.{&1310}\par It took a minute, but my head cleared. God, I hated needles. I pulled myself back up and dug into the medical supplies again for some body gauze and managed to get my stomach clumsily wrapped up so I wouldn't just end up bleeding out eventually anyways, even though if it had been that bad it probably would've already killed me by now.{&1310}\par Now ...{&1310}\par Now that I wasn't being chased by flesh-eating monsters, choked to death by vacuum, or hunted by ... by -- \i whoever\i0  it was that wanted me to get to dad -- now ... I finally had time to take stock of the situation.{&1310}\par The station was under attack. Obviously. By pirates or Tau? It only mattered a little. Dad was still alive. \i Okay\i0 . He was trying to find me, so I should find him first. My wrist comm was busted from that guy punching it, though, so I needed a comm linkup. This room might not stay empty or unnoticed forever either and there \i were\i0  boarders on the station. I didn't know how many or what state security was in so I couldn't just stay here. I needed to move, but the thoroughfares were probably just as dangerous as anywhere right now. Maybe more so depending on what this was all about, which I, of course, had no idea about at all.{&1310}\par Oh my god what about Tess?{&1310}\par What had happened to Tess? I had \i no\i0  idea. Dad was alive, sure, but it's not like my best friend was psychokinetic or I had a comm that wasn't broken she could reach me on. The thought that she might be dead suddenly froze me in place and made my blood run cold.{&1310}\par There was a comm station nearby for the bay operators and I practically charged the thing. At first, the terminal wouldn't even come up because it said it was in "Emergency Mode" and access was restricted. But my panicked brain knew enough to hit the emergency communications button to get past that. And then I-{&1310}\par "Shit. \i Shit\i0 !"{&1310}\par I couldn't remember Tess's comm ID number. {&1310}\par I didn't know it off the top of my head! I'd -- I'd had it on quickcall for so long and I'd dialed her up manually ever since and my comm had \i never\i0  been broken before -- I was so careful about those things -- but I ... I ...{&1310}\par I'd been through only god really knew what in the last twenty-four hours trying to stay alive and get the hell out of that nightmare I'd woken up in. And now the station was being attacked. Our \i home\i0  was being attacked. Who even knew what Tess had gone through in all that time?{&1310}\par It was like running right into a brick wall. I was starting to tear up, and I had to swipe at my eyes and breathe to get myself back under control. I had to think. Think, think, think -- \i think\i0 ! It had been years but ... I'd memorized it once. If I could just remember ...{&1310}\par But I only got a few numbers in before I wasn't sure of \i anything \i0 being real or if I just made it up to fill in the memory. I pounded my fists into the comms, and the screen fizzled and warped.{&1310}\par \i God damnit, Tess! If you hadn't hacked your own comm out of the system registry in the first place -- this wouldn't be a fucking problem right now!\i0 {&1310}\par For once, I fucking wished that station security had caught on to her. Or that I hadn't helped keep her fucking secret. Or that her \i fucking\i0  comm was in the \i fucking\i0  registry!{&1310}\par "DAMN IT!"{&1310}\par I slumped against the terminal, not caring at how it suddenly glitched up. I wanted to take the pistol and just shoot the thing like it would make the problem go away. Maybe it would. I considered it.{&1310}\par No.{&1310}\par \i Damn it, Tess, if you're dead I'll\i0  ...{&1310}\par \i I'll\i0  ...{&1310}\par Do nothing? What could I do? What could \i anyone\i0  do?{&1310}\par It was partway through just falling apart there feeling sorry for myself and miserable that I realized that I could just call someone else who had a working comm with Tess on it. Dad wouldn't have had it -- he'd stopped paying attention to who I hung out with years ago. But ... Bertram.{&1310}\par Bertram!{&1310}\par I straightened up and did a search for Bertram. \i He \i0 was in the system. \i He\i0  hadn't tried to covertly take himself out so he could mess around with people's private correspondence or low-level classified files. \i He\i0  had a bar that he needed to keep known and advertised.{&1310}\par I got Bertram's ID out of the registry and called him up on the emergency feed.{&1310}\par It took a long time to go through. \i Too\i0  long. And I had to check the nearest bay doors a few times while I waited, thinking I might have heard something out there over the sounds of the klaxons. It made me pull that pistol back out just in case.{&1310}\par "Evie?"{&1310}\par I whipped back around at that abrupt sound of my name and found myself looking at a familiar, pudgy face.{&1310}\par For a second, I was so relieved and excited and overwhelmed by the actual sight of someone I knew and cared about -- even over an emergency terminal -- that I forget what I was going to say. I felt like I'd been lost in another world for days -- \i week\i0 s -- alone, and without anyone. Lost. And I just stared dumbly at that old man with wide eyes about to tear up and let loose again before I could stop them.{&1310}\par "Evie?" he tried again.{&1310}\par "Y-yes," I managed to choke out, my voice suddenly thick and hoarse in my own ears. "I'm here, Bertram. It's me!"{&1310}\par "You look terrible, Evie, are you alright?"{&1310}\par "Yeah ... I'm -- I'm fine," I lied. I didn't want to talk about myself or where I'd been so I cut right into it first. "Bertram, where's Tess? Is she okay?"{&1310}\par There was the distant echo of small arms fire and my body twisted back around toward the bay behind me instantly. The gun was up and pointing wildly at everything that stood out as I quickly scanned the room again. But it wasn't here. It wasn't on my end.{&1310}\par "Evie!"{&1310}\par I spun right back around.{&1310}\par "Bertram?"{&1310}\par The old man crouched down -- I could only tell by the outline of the scene behind him since he was talking into his wrist comm, not a terminal. And, for the first time, I saw the haggard lines on his face, the ash on his forehead, and trace of blood down one cheek from a gash opened up across his temple. People were yelling in the background and they could have been soldiers. He might have been in his bar, but there was no way to tell from here. I'd just assumed everything was as it always had been when I'd first seen him. I was so very wrong.{&1310}\par "Evie, listen to me," he coughed out, and spat as smoke filled the air and the terminal image. "I don't know where Tess is, but you've gotta get yerself somewhere safe ... You're fath--"{&1310}\par An explosion.{&1310}\par The station reverberated around Bertram and black smoke poured over his comm, obscuring him from me. He cut off and all I could hear was his wheezing breath somewhere in the smog, then him trying to cough up a lung.{&1310}\par "Bertram--?"{&1310}\par The feed cut out abruptly, and I was left with a blank terminal sporting only the Dreggoran Navy ensignia staring back at me. I hadn't realized it until just then but my face was only centimeters from the screen. And that was all I could do for a few minutes -- stare.{&1310}\par Bertram had said he didn't know where Tess was. He'd barely gotten a chance to say anything at \i all\i0  before that blast had cut him off. It had sounded like fighting. Was he even at his bar? Where was Tess? Did she even know that her adopted father could have been dead right now for all I knew?{&1310}\par That thought stopped me cold.{&1310}\par \i Bertram \i0 ...{&1310}\par I had to get to them. I had to \i find\i0  them.{&1310}\par Now.{&1310}\par I had stared at that screen for too long without doing anything. By the time I reached out again it had locked up. And when I tried to load up another emergency feed and find someone else, the lights dimmed in the middle of it until they were gone and I was in darkness.{&1310}\par Panic froze me. For a moment, I was back in that dead research tower with those things all around me. I could \i hear\i0  one of them chewing on a corpse somewhere behind me in the dark and I turned around. Slowly.{&1310}\par The pistol was in my hand, shaking wildly though I couldn't see it. I raised it at that noise. Slowly. So slowly. Somehow, I was sure it was useless and would do nothing. Somehow, I knew I was already dead and pulling the trigger would just make it happen faster.{&1310}\par I couldn't fight. I couldn't run.{&1310}\par I was dead.{&1310}\par Then the lights came back on.{&1310}\par Power returned in a kick and a whirl, bringing the whole bay back to life in a sputtering gasp.{&1310}\par Someone was standing there.{&1310}\par The gun went off on its own.
