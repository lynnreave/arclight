I snapped straight up. Too far. The chair tipped right over and back with me. And I still felt the rush of cold night air and black.{&1310}\par I think I was fully awake again by the time we hit the floor. I know I was when the back of my head smacked metal. At least, there were no holes punched through my chest. Pain still shot through the abruptly-woken haze, though, and beat me in the back of the skull just like the floor.{&1310}\par Laying there it was hard not to keep shivering. It wasn't cold. Not anymore. But the rest of it was still hard to throw off so soon. Not that that had ever slowed the rest of the world down. It came on just as quickly as it always did.{&1310}\par I did manage to roll over onto my side by the time the old man decided to step all the way into the room, though. And I got a few more moments, crumpled in on myself there atop the steel deck. Then he was at it again.{&1310}\par "You fell asleep," came the flat tone. No condemnation, or argument. Just simple fact and disappointment.{&1310}\par "Not really ..." I mumbled, gripping my head with both hands.{&1310}\par Those crystalline, blue eyes studied me intently in the dark for a moment. I liked reading in the dark. For some reason, it usually kept me awake. Not today, though.{&1310}\par "Another dream?" he asked aloud after a moment. The doubt was heavy in his voice. He probably thought I was just making up an excuse for actually falling asleep. It didn't really matter that it wasn't like I had just gone to sleep like a normal person. That might have been something, and really hard to do sitting in my chair. No, I knew. I must have been staring blankly at those screens until they went to sleep themselves, and blacked out. Sleeping with my eyes wide open again.{&1310}\par He sighed. Then hit the lights.{&1310}\par A hand slapped my face instantly to keep it out. I winced, but that didn't stop him. Neither did the dizziness.{&1310}\par I mumbled something. He made more intelligible words when he spoke.{&1310}\par "Something new, or another of the same from before?"{&1310}\par One eye squeezed shut against the too-bright light, I managed to crawl back to the desk with a hand cradling the back of my head. A few tries with the rest of my clumsy fingers and the three screens above me flared to life. I winced at that too. But it wasn't just for the light.{&1310}\par The book I was supposed to be reading was scrolled across the pane there. Some comparitive studies of quantum phenomena and  ... I didn't even remember. Or care. I knew it was about other dimensions or something too complicated like that. Whatever. The old man understood and liked those kinds of ideas better than anyone else. Maybe that was why he made me read about it so much. Or why everything I read was at least partially written by him.{&1310}\par I tried to pull anything else back from before I had fallen asleep that I could think of. He did love to surprise me with a few, grating questions to make sure I actually read something. And I got pretty good at skimming. I wouldn't ever know why he found things like that so important to learn.{&1310}\par I had the system back on, anyways. And I even got the chair up and back under me. But any hope for forgetting that nightmare with a pop quiz on the text instead was dashed pretty soon. He started in with the usual questions after I answered the first.{&1310}\par "Nothing new," I explained, wincing against a new headache. "Just the same one with that man getting chased and finding the woman in the river."{&1310}\par "Brennan," he offered, and I nodded. "And her name?"{&1310}\par "Nope."{&1310}\par "Still seen through his eyes?"{&1310}\par "Like I was right there." I waved my free hand out irritably. "And inside his head." {&1310}\par The usual, thoughtful frown flashed across his face. That always troubled him the most, I knew. Something about dreaming someone else's thoughts entirely. I guess it would have unnerved me too, if I hadn't just tried to ignore it all.{&1310}\par He sighed. Then reached down a hand across me and the monitors winked back out.{&1310}\par "I hoped you would finish a lot more today," he continued on, a little impatiently, as he moved back away. I blinked after him around my hand.{&1310}\par "What do you mean?" I glanced down at my watch. The dizziness had started to fade. Not the skull fracture, though.{&1310}\par "It's still early," I told him as if he didn't already know. And was dumb enough to give him an incredulous glance. "I still have time."{&1310}\par Maybe he sensed that bit of desperation, but I would take \i anything \i0 over being rented out to some menial labor for the day. Not again. It was his preferred form of punishment. No matter that I couldn't help another episode coming on to eat up all my time.{&1310}\par "No, you don't."{&1310}\par "Why not?"{&1310}\par He hated explaining himself. Especially to me. Better I just took what I was given and did as he said. Today was different, though. Today, for some reason, he actually kept on after that.{&1310}\par "I was given a," he offered, pausing for the right word. "A warning," he finished. Not that he seemed entirely happy with it. "It's time you and I left the station for a while."{&1310}\par He had almost made it to the door before I got my mouth back shut. And open again. I just stared for a few, long moments. Stared at him. And stared for those words coming out of his mouth. {&1310}\par My response, when it finally came, was even more eloquent.{&1310}\par "What?"{&1310}\par He stopped in the doorway. A second's pause, and he even glanced back. Then he did something I had not seen him do in a very long, long ... long time.{&1310}\par He smiled at me.{&1310}\par "Get whatever you need, but only what you can carry," he said. For a moment, those eyes were not quite so hard.{&1310}\par "We're - " he barked one of his rare, sardonic laughs, "We're going planetside."{&1310}\par Then he was gone again before I could even think to ask why.{&1310}\par I had some time to do so, though. Too much. While I tore apart everything in my closet of a room and desperately tried to stuff it into whatever I could find and carry. It wasn't as easy as I'd hoped.
