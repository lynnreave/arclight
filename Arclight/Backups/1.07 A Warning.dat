"Eagerly" because that is exactly what his calm controlled way of just looking in my direction immediately would have been for anyone else. "Stumbled" because I didn't have the presence of mind to know how my feet had even gotten me back \i out \i0 of that death trap. I could sure bet it wasn't with any semblance of the military decorum they'd been trying to drill into me for the past six months.{&1310}\par The adjutant lieutenant at the desk smirked at the sight of me before turning back to his viewscreens.{&1310}\par "What did she say to you?" Morisant was demanding as we marched back down the outside hall and entered one of the lifts down to the lower decks. I'd lost time, and it made me jump to realize it. I couldn't even remember leaving the anteroom to Commander Delacroix's office. I must have been staring off into empty space the whole while like an idiot.{&1310}\par "I think she threatened to kill me."{&1310}\par The words came out hollow, and haunted by the flurry of overwrought nerves and anxious fears that swirled around inside my head like a planetside whitewash in winter. The whole thing left me feeling like a ghost -- floating in air without any real substance anymore. I was barely aware that Morisant was still staring at me.{&1310}\par "Cadet."{&1310}\par I blinked at his hand on my shoulder. He didn't shake me, but the jarring effect was just the same. I shook, and looked back over at him. I realized what I had said.{&1310}\par "What did she say to you?" he repeated.{&1310}\par I stared back dumbly at him for a few, long seconds while the gears started to turn back into place again. It didn't help that this cold, aloof man who had always stood so far away just observing and judging everything I did in sphinx-like silence was suddenly looking me right in the eye like I was important and had something to say. My mouth bobbed a few times before I managed to correct myself in a soft, less-than-sure voice unbecoming a future officer.{&1310}\par "That I probably wouldn't graduate."{&1310}\par It was dangerous, I realized, and hopefully he thought I was just another scared cadet intimidated out of their wits by a visit to the commander of the academy. I had no idea what she had been accusing me of or demanding back in that office and I didn't think I really wanted to know. How Morisant had reacted to her sending him out sent warning sirens off inside my head about what I could and might not want to say in case it got me in a lot more trouble than just what a failing grade would get me. There was something else going on there. So I tried to cover my own tracks.{&1310}\par The way the lieutenant eyed me for the next couple seconds made me think he might not have been so easily shaken off or misled. Or maybe I just wasn't a very good liar. Tess was. But he backed off just the same.{&1310}\par "That was highly inappropriate," he admitted instead, turning back toward the lift doors as we reached the squad bay's deck and they slipped open. "The commander weighs my reports and recommendations to make her decision, which I will carry out. She does not get involved. And if she does feel the need to" -- and he looked at me when he said the next part -- "it will always be with the attendant training officer present. \i I \i0 will bring the issue to her, not the other way around. Am I understood, cadet?"{&1310}\par I frowned at him in confusion at that. For a few more seconds, I wasn't sure what he meant or wanted from me. But then I started to think that he was warning me against ever letting Commander Delacroix corner me alone like that again. At least I hoped it was that, and not something else. I had no idea what sorts of politics were going on between these two, or anyone else for that matter. And the feeling that I had somehow stepped way too close to something incredibly dangerous without even realizing it was not lost on me now. I wondered if I might have been really lucky to even get out of there alive.{&1310}\par "Aye, sir." I bobbed my head.{&1310}\par Thankfully, he left it at that.{&1310}\par I wasn't home yet, though. And the next couple days passed in a blur of all new doubts, second-guessing, and fears. Not like the simple ones from before. Oh, no. Before all I had to worry about was whether or not I passed -- being a mediocre or an absolutely shitty cadet. That felt like a vacation next to what I had to worry about after seeing Commander Delacroix.{&1310}\par I ended up failing most of the remaining lessons and training sessions I had because I was just too paranoid and distracted to study or pay enough attention. Every comm chirp had me frozen in place like it would suddenly be summoning me to the upper decks again. Every pass by Lieutenant Morisant had levels of meaning now that I couldn't even been sure were really there. Did he look at me differently? I think so. I felt like I was being watched all the time, always, and not just in the usual way by the instructors. Security had everything tapped everywhere in a ship like this. Commander Delacroix and God knows who else were probably watching every little thing I did now. Before I could have faded into the backdrop of young, eager cadets. But now ... {&1310}\par I lost the little nerve and composure I had left and just started making all kinds of dumb mistakes for their amusement. {&1310}\par I started to wonder again if I should just stay home once I got there. There were a few cadets who had done that in the past. They were always disgraced, and one was even reassigned for regular enlistment because his family wasn't important or influential enough to get him out of it. I wondered if that would be better than \i this\i0 . Whatever \i this\i0  really was.{&1310}\par It was a mistake. Whatever Commander Delacroix thought about me. Whatever was going on. It was a mistake. It \i had\i0  to be. That sort of thing wouldn't just ... \i happen\i0 . Would it?{&1310}\par Why the \i hell\i0  would anyone want to keep a shitty cadet like me here? Everyone else was either trying to get rid of me or waiting until I flunked out. And why -- why, why, why, why! -- wouldn't Commander Delacroix know who it was? Why the fuck would she think \i I\i0  would know?{&1310}\par It didn't make any sense. It was a mistake.{&1310}\par \i That\i0  was the only thing that did make sense.{&1310}\par Komi tried to ask me about it. I was pretty sure that what the commander had said was meant to be confidential, and she probably hoped I'd be too terrified to tell anyone. I almost was. For a day or so. But I found myself unloading on Komi as soon as everything got so heavy that it was crushing me to pieces inside. I told her everything that the woman had said. Because I had to tell \i someone\i0 , and I sure as hell wasn't going to write home to Tess about it where someone -- probably Commander Delacroix! -- would see it. Komi took it all in without any better idea than me about what it meant.{&1310}\par "Well?" I had to blurt out to get her to answer me after telling her everything. She just sat there on her rack with this weird expression on her face, staring off into empty air. I thought she must have been doing that for a while and I'd just been so caught up I hadn't even noticed. So I snapped at her.{&1310}\par Komi blinked, and glanced up at me like she'd forgotten I was even there.{&1310}\par "What do you think? What should I do?" I demanded. She fixed on me in a distracted sort of way. What was wrong with her? This was fucking with \i me\i0 . And I needed an answer from someone -- \i anyone\i0 . About Commander Delacroix. Morisant. \i Everything\i0 .{&1310}\par "I," she started and, for the first time since I had known her -- I watched Komi hesitate. Actually second guess herself and what she must have been thinking. Sure, she'd gotten a little angry before, flustered, even ranted every so often when it was just me there and she was practically by herself but ... she'd always still been in control. Sure of herself and what she needed to do. Through everything -- she'd always had an answer for either herself, or for me. And I needed that now.{&1310}\par "I really don't know."{&1310}\par I stared at her for a few, long moments. {&1310}\par "What do you mean 'you\i  don't know\i0 '?"{&1310}\par I don't know why I was suddenly so mad at her like that. It wasn't her fault. The one time she didn't have an answer and I felt like I needed it most, but ... it wasn't her fault. I tried to calm down but I couldn't help it so I just threw my hands up and stalked away. The tiny bunkroom was too small to fit my wallowing frustration. It was like someone was trying to play a huge fucking game with my head and I had no idea what the point of it was supposed to be. Fear was turning to frustration and insanity began bubbling underneath. I didn't really know \i what\i0  I was supposed to even think about all of this anymore.{&1310}\par And all she can fucking say is "I REALLY DON'T KNOW?"?!{&1310}\par \i Calm\i0  \i down\i0 . \i It not her fault\i0 .{&1310}\par Well who's fault is it then?{&1310}\par Mine? Probably mine. Just like everything else. Just like-{&1310}\par "What's Project Arclight?"{&1310}\par I stopped abruptly. I didn't know why my head was spinning around so much. Talking about it out loud just seemed to make it worse, not better. I felt so powerless and confused and out of place here now that ... but Komi's question just cut right through the nagging silence outside my head. I stopped, and looked back at her.{&1310}\par "What?" It took me a second to wrap my scattered head around what she was even asking. Then my mouth just twisted up in frustration again. "How the hell should I know?"{&1310}\par She still had that deadpan, faraway look on her browned face. It was annoying. She shrugged in what felt like -- to me -- a forced way. I don't why I thought that, but I did.{&1310}\par "The commander of the academy wanted to know," she explained, as if I hadn't been the only reason she knew that. I'd \i told\i0  her that. "Maybe it's something important."{&1310}\par Something important. What a \i novel\i0  idea.{&1310}\par That was what my mouth wanted to say. But I managed to make it come out as, "I have \i no\i0  idea." I hadn't lied to Commander Delacroix about that and I wasn't lying now. I really had no reason to.{&1310}\par "She said it was before Riftwatch. How old were you when your family got there?"{&1310}\par I shook my head, sighing in a loud and irritated way I tried to but couldn't help. "I was \i born\i0  there," I snapped at her. The stress had finally caught up to me full force. You couldn't go six months in a place like this doing as poorly as I did without freaking out a little. And I felt like I was freaking out right now.{&1310}\par If I'd been in a better, less harried and ballistic state of mind, I might have realized there was no real way she could have known how ridiculous the whole thing was like I did until I told her. There \i was\i0  nothing before Riftwatch station -- not for me. I had the birth records to prove it, and even my earlist memory was at about two -- those reddish-purple flowers they grew in the central courtyards. They got their color from the light radiation coming off the Rift and they were probably the only thing about that place that was actually beautiful. I remembered them that day way too well to have made it up. There was a sect of horticulturists among the retired and veteran scientists that always seemed to make sure they stayed in bloom. \i Only\i0  on Riftwatch. Nowhere else.{&1310}\par "They do a lot of research projects for the Grand Admiral's there."{&1310}\par "So? So what?"{&1310}\par What was she getting at? Her tone was leading, I realized. She wasn't asking questions -- she was trying to push me somewhere. Why? She kept giving me these funny looks and now she was talking to me like this. Why?{&1310}\par She just shrugged. I thought about it some more like she seemed to want me to and I think I eventually got her meaning.{&1310}\par "You think someone might have experimented on me?"{&1310}\par I said that out loud and then I tried to laugh it off. I tried to convince myself it was impossible. But she just shrugged again, and it suddenly made me so mad all over again seeing her do that -- the thought of it -- the nanos in medbay ... I cringed. My skin crawled. Then I just forced myself to laugh again. It had to be the stupidest thing she could have suggested to me. It \i had\i0  to be.{&1310}\par Genetic experimentation. On \i me\i0 ! Of all people?{&1310}\par "You think I'd be so terrible at all of this if someone had?" I continued out loud, swinging a hand around and taking in the entire semester all at once. "Shouldn't I be, like, fucking awesome? Super strong, or fast, or smart?" And I wasn't any of those. There were procedures that could already do those sorts of things. The advanced training programs would expose psychokinetic applicants and certain specialists to them anyways. They were some risks, especially with any treatment that messed around too much inside your head. But it was well known, documented, and used all over the sector. No one needed to sneak anything new through me.{&1310}\par \i Me\i0 !{&1310}\par I wanted to laugh so hard but, for some reason, I just couldn't quit make myself do it.{&1310}\par "It wouldn't have had to be successful," Komi said then. "If it really was an experiment."{&1310}\par What she meant took awhile again to catch up with me. And I must have stared at her a little too dumbly after that or it was all she felt like saying about the whole thing, because the conversation petered out. Which was just as well because I was tired of it anyways. I couldn't remember why I thought Komi would be much help in the first place. She didn't know any more than I did and the whole thing just sort of frustrated me in a way I couldn't even explain. Komi seriously pissed me off for probably the first time ever, and it wasn't even her fault. I just couldn't talk to anyone right now. Something was wrong with \i me\i0 .{&1310}\par I needed to get away. So bad. I just really needed to get away from all this now.{&1310}\par I managed to hold out just a little bit longer until the day we shipped out for pre-finals leave came and found our whole platoon standing at attention around the squad bay in our smart uniforms, looking just like the soldiers most of us would become. Young, fresh, half-starved and raw. I looked around the room out of the corner of my eyes and felt out of place both physicall and mentally. The uniform felt too big, like I couldn't ever fill it. If anyone else was having the same problems as me, I couldn't see it. And why should they? They didn't have a creepy robot eye and vague death threats pushing in at the back of their head.{&1310}\par "Let me remind you, cadets."{&1310}\par Lieutenant Morisant was standing at the head of the squad bay with his sergeant instructors floating around him, mountains of hard-faced dispassion that could have snapped any single cadet that stepped out of line in a heartbeat. Gunny Abarca, the head instructor, stood at rest just a step behind the lieutenant's elbow, looking calm and in control.{&1310}\par Morisant started walking.{&1310}\par "We are at war with pirates who would like nothing more than to see all of us dead," he continued on, bellowing out loudly in his composed, authoritative voice. Like nothing could faze him. "Every single one of you was sent here because you are the pinnacle of human and battlefield evolution. All of \i you\i0  represent the future. And I expect you to act like it."{&1310}\par  He moved around so that he looked each of us in the eye where we stood up and down the squad bay as he spoke. The bodies of cadets bristled in sequence like a wave as he passed and that gaze took them in, measuring everything that we had been through the whole semester in a single glance.{&1310}\par "This academy is meant to hone the deadliest, most destructive weapons at the Grand Admirals' disposal. There is no room for error at the end of this program. An untrained psychokinetic is even more dangerous to his or her fellow soldiers than the enemy. When you graduate -- \i if\i0  you graduate -- you will be an instrument of discipline and control. Or you will be destroyed. Not by the enemy. By your fellow officers.{&1310}\par "When you leave this ship, you will take that long ride back home to think about all that you've learned and done here. What you've seen of yourselves. And what will come. This was the easy part. If you graduate, it's war from here on out."{&1310}\par He said the last as he slowed down. His heels clicked together and he turned toward the next cadet. I realized without enough fanfare that it was actually me.{&1310}\par No one had looked the lieutenant in the eye. Everyone had stared straight ahead and through him. I'd watched. I'd sat there feeling like all my courage and mental fortitude had finally been exhausted. I wanted to say that I didn't care anymore. That would've made it easy. Easi\i er\i0 . But I was just tired. I just wanted to get away from this -- from \i all\i0  of this. Maybe forever.{&1310}\par I looked him in the eye. It wasn't brave or defiant. I just felt his weighing gaze on me like the others, only with me it was demanding me look back. I don't know what I saw there in his flint-like, beaten eyes. He'd seen combat. He had the look that everyone talked about wanting. He had that look in his eyes and he was communicating something silently to me that was different than every other cadet in the room.{&1310}\par But all he said was: "Be ready."{&1310}\par Then he moved on, and I felt dead to the world again.\cf2\f2 {&1310}\par }{&1310}

They got their color from the light radiation coming off the Rift and they were probably the only thing about that place that was actually beautiful. I remembered them that day way too well to have made it up. There was a sect of horticulturists among the retired and veteran scientists that always seemed to make sure they stayed in bloom. \i Only\i0  on Riftwatch. Nowhere else.{&1310}\par "They do a lot of research projects for the Grand Admiral's there."{&1310}\par "So? So what?"{&1310}\par What was she getting at? Her tone was leading, I realized. She wasn't asking questions -- she was trying to push me somewhere. Why? She kept giving me these funny looks and now she was talking to me like this. Why?{&1310}\par She just shrugged. I thought about it some more like she seemed to want me to and I think I eventually got her meaning.{&1310}\par "You think someone might have experimented on me?"{&1310}\par I said that out loud and then I tried to laugh it off. I tried to convince myself it was impossible. But she just shrugged again, and it suddenly made me so mad all over again seeing her do that -- the thought of it -- the nanos in medbay ... I cringed. My skin crawled. Then I just forced myself to laugh again. It had to be the stupidest thing she could have suggested to me. It \i had\i0  to be.{&1310}\par Genetic experimentation. On \i me\i0 ! Of all people?{&1310}\par "You think I'd be so terrible at all of this if someone had?" I continued out loud, swinging a hand around and taking in the entire semester all at once. "Shouldn't I be, like, fucking awesome? Super strong, or fast, or smart?" And I wasn't any of those. There were procedures that could already do those sorts of things. The advanced training programs would expose psychokinetic applicants and certain specialists to them anyways. They were some risks, especially with any treatment that messed around too much inside your head. But it was well known, documented, and used all over the sector. No one needed to sneak anything new through me.{&1310}\par \i Me\i0 !{&1310}\par I wanted to laugh so hard but, for some reason, I just couldn't quit make myself do it.{&1310}\par "It wouldn't have had to be successful," Komi said then. "If it really was an experiment."{&1310}\par What she meant took awhile again to catch up with me. And I must have stared at her a little too dumbly after that or it was all she felt like saying about the whole thing, because the conversation petered out. Which was just as well because I was tired of it anyways. I couldn't remember why I thought Komi would be much help in the first place. She didn't know any more than I did and the whole thing just sort of frustrated me in a way I couldn't even explain. Komi seriously pissed me off for probably the first time ever, and it wasn't even her fault. I just couldn't talk to anyone right now. Something was wrong with \i me\i0 .{&1310}\par I needed to get away. So bad. I just really needed to get away from all this now.{&1310}\par I managed to hold out just a little bit longer until the day we shipped out for pre-finals leave came and found our whole platoon standing at attention around the squad bay in our smart uniforms, looking just like the soldiers most of us would become. Young, fresh, half-starved and raw. I looked around the room out of the corner of my eyes and felt out of place both physicall and mentally. The uniform felt too big, like I couldn't ever fill it. If anyone else was having the same problems as me, I couldn't see it. And why should they? They didn't have a creepy robot eye and vague death threats pushing in at the back of their head.{&1310}\par "Let me remind you, cadets."{&1310}\par Lieutenant Morisant was standing at the head of the squad bay with his sergeant instructors floating around him, mountains of hard-faced dispassion that could have snapped any single cadet that stepped out of line in a heartbeat. Gunny Abarca, the head instructor, stood at rest just a step behind the lieutenant's elbow, looking calm and in control.{&1310}\par Morisant started walking.{&1310}\par "We are at war with pirates who would like nothing more than to see all of us dead," he continued on, bellowing out loudly in his composed, authoritative voice. Like nothing could faze him. "Every single one of you was sent here because you are the pinnacle of human and battlefield evolution. All of \i you\i0  represent the future. And I expect you to act like it."{&1310}\par  He moved around so that he looked each of us in the eye where we stood up and down the squad bay as he spoke. The bodies of cadets bristled in sequence like a wave as he passed and that gaze took them in, measuring everything that we had been through the whole semester in a single glance.{&1310}\par "This academy is meant to hone the deadliest, most destructive weapons at the Grand Admirals' disposal. There is no room for error at the end of this program. An untrained psychokinetic is even more dangerous to his or her fellow soldiers than the enemy. When you graduate -- \i if\i0  you graduate -- you will be an instrument of discipline and control. Or you will be destroyed. Not by the enemy. By your fellow officers.{&1310}\par "When you leave this ship, you will take that long ride back home to think about all that you've learned and done here. What you've seen of yourselves. And what will come. This was the easy part. If you graduate, it's war from here on out."{&1310}\par He said the last as he slowed down. His heels clicked together and he turned toward the next cadet. I realized without enough fanfare that it was actually me.{&1310}\par No one had looked the lieutenant in the eye. Everyone had stared straight ahead and through him. I'd watched. I'd sat there feeling like all my courage and mental fortitude had finally been exhausted. I wanted to say that I didn't care anymore. That would've made it easy. Easi\i er\i0 . But I was just tired. I just wanted to get away from this -- from \i all\i0  of this. Maybe forever.{&1310}\par I looked him in the eye. It wasn't brave or defiant. I just felt his weighing gaze on me like the others, only with me it was demanding me look back. I don't know what I saw there in his flint-like, beaten eyes. He'd seen combat. He had the look that everyone talked about wanting. He had that look in his eyes and he was communicating something silently to me that was different than every other cadet in the room.{&1310}\par But all he said was: "Be ready."{&1310}\par Then he moved on, and I felt dead to the world again.\cf2\f2 {&1310}\par }{&1310}

It made me feel like a ghost, floating in air without any real substance anymore. I was barely aware that Morisant was still staring at me.{&1310}\par "Cadet."{&1310}\par I blinked at his hand on my shoulder. He didn't shake me, but the jarring effect was just the same. I shook, and looked back over at him. I realized what I had said.{&1310}\par "What did she say to you?" he repeated.{&1310}\par I stared back dumbly at him for a few, long seconds while the gears started to turn back into place again. My mouth bobbed a few times before I managed to correct myself in a soft, less-than-sure voice unbecoming a future officer.{&1310}\par "That I probably wouldn't graduate."{&1310}\par It was dangerous, I realized, and hopefully he thought I was just another scared cadet intimidated out of their wits by a visit to the commander of the academy. I had no idea what she had been accusing me of or demanding back in that office and I didn't think I really wanted to know. How Morisant had reacted to her sending him out sent warning sirens off inside my head about what I could and might not want to say in case it got me in a lot more trouble than just what a failing grade would get me. There was something else going on there. So I tried to cover my tracks.{&1310}\par The way the lieutenant eyed me for the next couple seconds made me think he might not have been so easily shaken off or misled. Or maybe I just wasn't a very good liar. Tess was.

"The commander weighs my reports and recommendations to make her decision, which I will carry out. She does not get involved.

At least I hoped it was that, and not something else. I had no idea what sorts of politics were going on between these two, or anyone else for that matter. And the feeling that I had somehow stepped way too close to something incredibly dangerous without even realizing it was not lost on me now. I wondered if I might have been really lucky to even get out of there alive.{&1310}\par I wasn't home yet, though. And the next couple days passed in a blur of all new doubts, second-guessing, and fears. Not like the simple ones from before. Oh, no. Before all I had to worry about was whether or not I passed -- being a mediocre or an absolutely shitty cadet. That felt like a vacation next to what I had to worry about after seeing Commander Delacroix.{&1310}\par I ended up failing most of the remaining lessons and training sessions I had because I was just too paranoid to study or pay full attention, and I started to wonder again if I should just stay home once I got there. There were a few cadets who had done that in the past. They were always disgraced, and one was even reassigned for regular enlistment because his family wasn't important or influential enough to get him out of it. I wondered if that would be better than \i this\i0 . Whatever \i this\i0  really was.{&1310}\par It was a mistake. Whatever Commander Delacroix thought about me. Whatever was going on. It was a mistake. It \i had\i0  to be. That sort of thing wouldn't just ... \i happen\i0 . Would it?{&1310}\par Why the \i hell\i0  would anyone want to keep a shitty cadet like me here? Everyone else was either trying to get rid of me or waiting until I flunked out. And why -- why, why, why, why! -- wouldn't Commander Delacroix know who it was? Why the fuck would she think \i I\i0  would know?{&1310}\par It didn't make any sense. It was a mistake.{&1310}\par \i That\i0  was the only thing that did make sense.{&1310}\par Komi tried to ask me about it. I was pretty sure that what the commander had said was meant to be confidential, and she probably hoped I'd be too terrified to tell anyone. I almost was. For a day or so. But I found myself unloading on Komi as soon as everything got so heavy that it was crushing me to pieces inside. I told hereverything that the woman had said. Because I had to tell \i someone\i0 , and I sure as hell wasn't going to write home to Tess about it where someone -- probably Commander Delacroix! -- would see it. Komi took it all in without any better idea than me about what it meant.{&1310}\par "Well?" I had to blurt out to get her to answer me after telling her everything. She just sat there on her rack with this weird expression on her face, staring off into empty air.{&1310}\par Komi blinked, and glanced up at me like she'd forgotten I was even there.{&1310}\par "What do you think? What should I do?" I demanded. What was wrong with her? This was fucking with \i me\i0 . And I needed an answer from someone -- \i anyone\i0 . About Commander Delacroix. Morisant. \i Everything\i0 .{&1310}\par "I," she started and, for the first time since I had known her -- I watched Komi hesitate. Actually second guess herself and what she must have been thinking. Sure, she'd gotten a little angry before, flustered, even ranted every so often when it was just me there and she was practically by herself but ... she'd always still been in control. Sure of herself and what she needed to do. Through everything -- she'd always had an answer for either herself, or for me. And I needed that now.{&1310}\par "I really don't know."{&1310}\par I stared at her for a few, long moments. {&1310}\par "What do you mean '\i you don't know\i0 '?"{&1310}\par I don't know why I was practically yelling at her. It wasn't her fault. The one time she didn't have an answer and I felt like I needed it most, but ... it wasn't her fault. I tried to calm down but I couldn't help it so I just threw my hands up and stalked away. The tiny bunkroom was too small to fit my wallowing frustration. It was like someone was trying to play a huge fucking game with my head and I had no idea what the point of it was supposed to be. Fear was turning to frustration and insanity began bubbling underneath. I didn't really know \i what\i0  I was supposed to even think about all of this anymore.{&1310}\par And all she can fucking say is "I REALLY DON'T KNOW?"?!{&1310}\par \i Calm\i0  \i down\i0 .{&1310}\par It wasn't her fault.{&1310}\par Well who's fault is it then?{&1310}\par I \i really \i0 don't know.{&1310}\par Shut up.{&1310}\par "What's Project Arclight?"{&1310}\par I stopped abruptly. I didn't know why my head was spinning around so much. Talking about it out loud just seemed to make it worse, not better. Komi's question cut through the silence outside my head, though. I stopped, and looked back at her.{&1310}\par "How the hell should I know?"{&1310}\par She still had that deadpan, faraway look on her browned face. It was annoying. She shrugged in what felt like -- to me -- a forced way. I don't why I thought that.{&1310}\par "The commander of the academy wanted to know," she explained, as if I hadn't been the only reason she knew that. I \i told\i0  her that. "Maybe it's something important."{&1310}\par "I have \i no\i0  idea." I hadn't lied to Commander Delacroix. I had no reason to.{&1310}\par "She said it was before Riftwatch. How old were you when your family got there?"{&1310}\par I shook my head, sighing in a loud and irritated way I tried to but couldn't help. "I was \i born\i0  there," I snapped at her. The stress had finally caught up to me full force. You couldn't go six months in a place like this doing as poorly as I did without freaking out a little. And I felt like I was freaking out now.{&1310}\par If I'd been in a better, less harried and ballistic state of mind, I might have realized there was no real way she could have known how ridiculous the whole thing was like I did until I told her. There \i was\i0  nothing before Riftwatch station -- not for me. I had the birth records to prove it, and even my earlist memory was at about two -- those reddish-purple flowers they grew in the central courtyards. They got their color from the light radiation coming off the Rift and they were probably the only thing about that place that was actually beautiful. I remembered them that day way too well to have made it up. There was a sect of horticulturists among the retired and veteran scientists that always seemed to make sure they stayed in bloom.{&1310}\par "They do a lot of research projects for the Grand Admiral's there."{&1310}\par What was she getting at? Her tone was leading, I realized. She wasn't asking questions -- she was trying to push me somewhere. Why? She kept giving me these funny looks and now she was talking to me like this. Why?{&1310}\par "So?"{&1310}\par She just shrugged. I thought about it some more like she seemed to want me to and I think I got her meaning.{&1310}\par "You think someone might have experimented on me?"{&1310}\par I tried to laugh it off.

I tried to calm down but I couldn't help it so I just threw my hands up and stalked away. The tiny bunkroom was too small to fit my wallowing frustration. It was like someone was trying to play a huge fucking game with my head and I had no idea what the point of it was supposed to be. Fear was turning to frustration and insanity began bubbling underneath. I didn't really know \i what\i0  I was supposed to even think about all of this anymore.{&1310}\par And all she can fucking say is "I REALLY DON'T KNOW?"?!{&1310}\par \i Calm\i0  \i down\i0 .{&1310}\par It wasn't her fault.{&1310}\par Well who's fault is it then?{&1310}\par I \i really \i0 don't know.{&1310}\par Shut up.{&1310}\par "What's Project Arclight?"{&1310}\par I stopped abruptly. I didn't know why my head was spinning around so much. Talking about it out loud just seemed to make it worse, not better. Komi's question cut through the silence outside my head, though. I stopped, and looked back at her.{&1310}\par "How the hell should I know?"{&1310}\par She still had that deadpan, faraway look on her browned face. It was annoying. She shrugged in what felt like -- to me -- a forced way. I don't why I thought that.{&1310}\par "The commander of the academy wanted to know," she explained, as if I hadn't been the only reason she knew that. I \i told\i0  her that. "Maybe it's something important."{&1310}\par "I have \i no\i0  idea." I hadn't lied to Commander Delacroix. I had no reason to.{&1310}\par "She said it was before Riftwatch. How old were you when your family got there?"{&1310}\par I shook my head, sighing in a loud and irritated way I tried to but couldn't help. "I was \i born\i0  there," I snapped at her. The stress had finally caught up to me full force. You couldn't go six months in a place like this doing as poorly as I did without freaking out a little. And I felt like I was freaking out now.{&1310}\par If I'd been in a better, less harried and ballistic state of mind, I might have realized there was no real way she could have known how ridiculous the whole thing was like I did until I told her. There \i was\i0  nothing before Riftwatch station -- not for me. I had the birth records to prove it, and even my earlist memory was at about two -- those reddish-purple flowers they grew in the central courtyards. They got their color from the light radiation coming off the Rift and they were probably the only thing about that place that was actually beautiful. I remembered them that day way too well to have made it up. There was a sect of horticulturists among the retired and veteran scientists that always seemed to make sure they stayed in bloom.{&1310}\par "They do a lot of research projects for the Grand Admiral's there."{&1310}\par What was she getting at? Her tone was leading, I realized. She wasn't asking questions -- she was trying to push me somewhere. Why? She kept giving me these funny looks and now she was talking to me like this. Why?{&1310}\par "So?"{&1310}\par She just shrugged. I thought about it some more like she seemed to want me to and I think I got her meaning.{&1310}\par "You think someone might have experimented on me?"{&1310}\par I tried to laugh it off. She shrugged again, and it suddenly made me so mad seeing her do that -- the thought of it -- the nanos in medbay ... I cringed. My skin crawled. Then I just forced myself to laugh again. It was probably the stupidest thing she could have suggested to me. {&1310}\par \i Me\i0 !{&1310}\par "You think I'd be so terrible at all of this if someone had? Shouldn't I be, like, fucking awesome? Super strong, or fast, or smart?" And I wasn't any of those. There were procedures that could already do those sorts of things. The advanced training programs would expose psychokinetic applicants and certain specialists to them anyways. They were some risks, especially with any treatment that messed around too much inside your head. Again, I cringed on the inside just thinking about any of that. I don't know why I didn't want her to see.{&1310}\par "It wouldn't have had to be successful," she said. "If it was just an experiment."{&1310}\par I must have stared at her a little too dumbly after that, because the conversation petered out. I was tired of it anyways. The whole thing just sort of frustrated me in a way I couldn't even explain. Komi seriously pissed me off for probably the first time ever, and it wasn't even her fault. I just couldn't talk to anyone right now. Something was wrong with \i me\i0 .{&1310}\par I needed to get away. So bad.{&1310}\par I held out just a little bit longer until the day we shipped out for pre-finals leave came and found our whole platoon standing at attention around the squad bay in our smart uniforms, looking just like the soldiers most of us would become. Young, fresh, half-starved and raw. I looked around the room out of the corner of my eyes and felt out of place both physicall and mentally. The uniform felt too big, like I couldn't ever fill it. If anyone else was having the same problems as me, I couldn't see it. And why should they? They didn't have a creepy robot eye and vague death threats pushing in at the back of their head.{&1310}\par "Let me remind you, cadets."{&1310}\par Lieutenant Morisant was standing at the head of the squad bay with his sergeant instructors floating around him, mountains of hard-faced dispassion that could have snapped any single cadet that stepped out of line in a heartbeat. Gunny Abarca, the head instructor, stood at rest just a step behind the lieutenant's elbow, looking calm and in control.{&1310}\par Morisant started walking.{&1310}\par "We are at war with pirates who would like nothing more than to see all of us dead," he continued on, bellowing out loudly in his composed, authoritative voice. Like nothing could faze him. "Every single one of you was sent here because you are the pinnacle of human and battlefield evolution. All of \i you\i0  represent the future. And I expect you to act like it."{&1310}\par  He moved around so that he looked each of us in the eye where we stood around the squad bay as he spoke. The bodies of cadets bristled in sequence like a wave as he passed and that gaze took them in, measuring everything that we were for the whole semester in a single glance.{&1310}\par "This academy is meant to hone the bodies and minds of the deadliest, most destructive weapons at the Grand Admirals' disposal. There is no room for error at the end of this program. An untrained psychokinetic is even more dangerous to his or her fellow soldiers than the enemy. When you graduate -- \i if\i0  you graduate -- you will be an instrument of discipline and control. Or you will be destroyed. Not by the enemy. By your fellow officers.{&1310}\par "You leave here and you will take that long ride back home to think about all that you've learned and done here. What you've seen of yourselves. And what will come. This was the easy part. If you graduate, it's war from here on out."{&1310}\par He said the last as he slowed down. His heels clicked together and he turned toward the next cadet. I realized it was me.{&1310}\par No one had looked the lieutenant in the eye. Everyone had stared straight ahead and through him. I'd watched. I'd sat there feeling like all my courage and mental fortitude had finally been exhausted. I wanted to say that I didn't care anymore. That would've made it easy. Easi\i er\i0 . But I was just tired. I just wanted to get away from this -- from \i all\i0  of this. Maybe forever.{&1310}\par I looked him in the eye. It wasn't brave or defiant. I just felt his weighing gaze on me like the others, only with me it was demanding me look back. I don't know what I saw there in his flint-like, beaten eyes. He'd seen combat. He had the look that everyone talked about wanting. He had that look in his eyes and he was communicating something silently to me that was different that every other cadet in the room.{&1310}\par But all he said was: "Be ready."{&1310}\par Then he moved on, and I felt dead to the world again.\cf2\f2 {&1310}\par }{&1310}

"Eagerly" because that is exactly what his calm controlled way of just looking in my direction immediately would have been for anyone else. "Stumbled" because I didn't have the presence of mind to know how my feet had even gotten me back \i out \i0 of that death trap. I could sure bet it wasn't with any semblance of the military decorum they'd been trying to drill into me for the past six months.{&1310}\par The adjutant lieutenant at the desk smirked at the sight of me before turning back to his viewscreens.{&1310}\par "What did she say to you?" Morisant was demanding as we marched back down the outside hall and entered one of the lifts down to the lower decks. I'd lost time, and it made me jump to realize it. I couldn't even remember leaving the anteroom to Commander Delacroix's office. I must have been staring off into empty space the whole while like an idiot.{&1310}\par "I think she threatened to kill me."{&1310}\par The words came out hollow, and haunted by the flurry of overwrought nerves and anxious fears that swirled around inside my head like a planetside whitewash in winter. The whole thing left me feeling like a ghost -- floating in air without any real substance anymore. I was barely aware that Morisant was still staring at me.{&1310}\par "Cadet."{&1310}\par I blinked at his hand on my shoulder. He didn't shake me, but the jarring effect was just the same. I shook, and looked back over at him. I realized what I had said.{&1310}\par "What did she say to you?" he repeated.{&1310}\par I stared back dumbly at him for a few, long seconds while the gears started to turn back into place again. It didn't help that this cold, aloof man who had always stood so far away just observing and judging everything I did in sphinx-like silence was suddenly looking me right in the eye like I was important and had something to say. My mouth bobbed a few times before I managed to correct myself in a soft, less-than-sure voice unbecoming a future officer.{&1310}\par "That I probably wouldn't graduate."{&1310}\par It was dangerous, I realized, and hopefully he thought I was just another scared cadet intimidated out of their wits by a visit to the commander of the academy. I had no idea what she had been accusing me of or demanding back in that office and I didn't think I really wanted to know. How Morisant had reacted to her sending him out sent warning sirens off inside my head about what I could and might not want to say in case it got me in a lot more trouble than just what a failing grade would get me. There was something else going on there. So I tried to cover my own tracks.{&1310}\par The way the lieutenant eyed me for the next couple seconds made me think he might not have been so easily shaken off or misled. Or maybe I just wasn't a very good liar. Tess was. But he backed off just the same.{&1310}\par "That was highly inappropriate," he admitted instead, turning back toward the lift doors as we reached the squad bay's deck and they slipped open. "The commander weighs my reports and recommendations to make her decision, which I will carry out. She does not get involved. And if she does feel the need to" -- and he looked at me when he said the next part -- "it will always be with the attendant training officer present. \i I \i0 will bring the issue to her, not the other way around. Am I understood, cadet?"{&1310}\par I frowned at him in confusion at that. For a few more seconds, I wasn't sure what he meant or wanted from me. But then I started to think that he was warning me against ever letting Commander Delacroix corner me alone like that again. At least I hoped it was that, and not something else. I had no idea what sorts of politics were going on between these two, or anyone else for that matter. And the feeling that I had somehow stepped way too close to something incredibly dangerous without even realizing it was not lost on me now. I wondered if I might have been really lucky to even get out of there alive.{&1310}\par "Aye, sir." I bobbed my head.{&1310}\par Thankfully, he left it at that.{&1310}\par I wasn't home yet, though. And the next couple days passed in a blur of all new doubts, second-guessing, and fears. Not like the simple ones from before. Oh, no. Before all I had to worry about was whether or not I passed -- being a mediocre or an absolutely shitty cadet. That felt like a vacation next to what I had to worry about after seeing Commander Delacroix.{&1310}\par I ended up failing most of the remaining lessons and training sessions I had because I was just too paranoid and distracted to study or pay enough attention. Every comm chirp had me frozen in place like it would suddenly be summoning me to the upper decks again. Every pass by Lieutenant Morisant had levels of meaning now that I couldn't even been sure were really there. Did he look at me differently? I think so. I felt like I was being watched all the time, always, and not just in the usual way by the instructors. Security had everything tapped everywhere in a ship like this. Commander Delacroix and God knows who else were probably watching every little thing I did now. Before I could have faded into the backdrop of young, eager cadets. But now ... {&1310}\par I lost the little nerve and composure I had left and just started making all kinds of dumb mistakes for their amusement. {&1310}\par I started to wonder again if I should just stay home once I got there. There were a few cadets who had done that in the past. They were always disgraced, and one was even reassigned for regular enlistment because his family wasn't important or influential enough to get him out of it. I wondered if that would be better than \i this\i0 . Whatever \i this\i0  really was.{&1310}\par It was a mistake. Whatever Commander Delacroix thought about me. Whatever was going on. It was a mistake. It \i had\i0  to be. That sort of thing wouldn't just ... \i happen\i0 . Would it?{&1310}\par Why the \i hell\i0  would anyone want to keep a shitty cadet like me here? Everyone else was either trying to get rid of me or waiting until I flunked out. And why -- why, why, why, why! -- wouldn't Commander Delacroix know who it was? Why the fuck would she think \i I\i0  would know?{&1310}\par It didn't make any sense. It was a mistake.{&1310}\par \i That\i0  was the only thing that did make sense.{&1310}\par Komi tried to ask me about it. I was pretty sure that what the commander had said was meant to be confidential, and she probably hoped I'd be too terrified to tell anyone. I almost was. For a day or so. But I found myself unloading on Komi as soon as everything got so heavy that it was crushing me to pieces inside. I told her everything that the woman had said. Because I had to tell \i someone\i0 , and I sure as hell wasn't going to write home to Tess about it where someone -- probably Commander Delacroix! -- would see it. Komi took it all in without any better idea than me about what it meant.{&1310}\par "Well?" I had to blurt out to get her to answer me after telling her everything. She just sat there on her rack with this weird expression on her face, staring off into empty air. I thought she must have been doing that for a while and I'd just been so caught up I hadn't even noticed. So I snapped at her.{&1310}\par Komi blinked, and glanced up at me like she'd forgotten I was even there.{&1310}\par "What do you think? What should I do?" I demanded. She fixed on me in a distracted sort of way. What was wrong with her? This was fucking with \i me\i0 . And I needed an answer from someone -- \i anyone\i0 . About Commander Delacroix. Morisant. \i Everything\i0 .{&1310}\par "I," she started and, for the first time since I had known her -- I watched Komi hesitate. Actually second guess herself and what she must have been thinking. Sure, she'd gotten a little angry before, flustered, even ranted every so often when it was just me there and she was practically by herself but ... she'd always still been in control. Sure of herself and what she needed to do. Through everything -- she'd always had an answer for either herself, or for me. And I needed that now.{&1310}\par "I really don't know."{&1310}\par I stared at her for a few, long moments. {&1310}\par "What do you mean 'you\i  don't know\i0 '?"{&1310}\par I don't know why I was suddenly so mad at her like that. It wasn't her fault. The one time she didn't have an answer and I felt like I needed it most, but ... it wasn't her fault. I tried to calm down but I couldn't help it so I just threw my hands up and stalked away. The tiny bunkroom was too small to fit my wallowing frustration. It was like someone was trying to play a huge fucking game with my head and I had no idea what the point of it was supposed to be. Fear was turning to frustration and insanity began bubbling underneath. I didn't really know \i what\i0  I was supposed to even think about all of this anymore.{&1310}\par And all she can fucking say is "I REALLY DON'T KNOW?"?!{&1310}\par \i Calm\i0  \i down\i0 . \i It not her fault\i0 .{&1310}\par Well who's fault is it then?{&1310}\par Mine? Probably mine. Just like everything else. Just like-{&1310}\par "What's Project Arclight?"{&1310}\par I stopped abruptly. I didn't know why my head was spinning around so much. Talking about it out loud just seemed to make it worse, not better. I felt so powerless and confused and out of place here now that ... but Komi's question just cut right through the nagging silence outside my head. I stopped, and looked back at her.{&1310}\par "What?" It took me a second to wrap my scattered head around what she was even asking. Then my mouth just twisted up in frustration again. "How the hell should I know?"{&1310}\par She still had that deadpan, faraway look on her browned face. It was annoying. She shrugged in what felt like -- to me -- a forced way.

The advanced training programs would expose psychokinetic applicants and certain specialists to them anyways.

So I tried to cover my own tracks.{&1310}\par The way the lieutenant eyed me for the next couple seconds made me think he might not have been so easily shaken off or misled. Or maybe I just wasn't a very good liar. Tess was. But he backed off just the same.{&1310}\par "That was highly inappropriate," he admitted instead, turning back toward the lift doors as we reached the squad bay's deck and they slipped open. "The commander weighs my reports and recommendations to make her decision, which I will carry out. She does not get involved. And if she does feel the need to" -- and he looked at me when he said the next part -- "it will always be with the attendant training officer present. \i I \i0 will bring the issue to her, not the other way around. Am I understood, cadet?"{&1310}\par I frowned at him in confusion at that. For a few more seconds, I wasn't sure what he meant or wanted from me. But then I started to think that he was warning me against ever letting Commander Delacroix corner me alone like that again. At least I hoped it was that, and not something else. I had no idea what sorts of politics were going on between these two, or anyone else for that matter. And the feeling that I had somehow stepped way too close to something incredibly dangerous without even realizing it was not lost on me now. I wondered if I might have been really lucky to even get out of there alive.{&1310}\par "Aye, sir." I bobbed my head.{&1310}\par Thankfully, he left it at that.{&1310}\par I wasn't home yet, though. And the next couple days passed in a blur of all new doubts, second-guessing, and fears. Not like the simple ones from before. Oh, no. Before all I had to worry about was whether or not I passed -- being a mediocre or an absolutely shitty cadet. That felt like a vacation next to what I had to worry about after seeing Commander Delacroix.{&1310}\par I ended up failing most of the remaining lessons and training sessions I had because I was just too paranoid and distracted to study or pay enough attention. Every comm chirp had me frozen in place like it would suddenly be summoning me to the upper decks again. Every pass by Lieutenant Morisant had levels of meaning now that I couldn't even been sure were really there. Did he look at me differently? I think so. I felt like I was being watched all the time, always, and not just in the usual way by the instructors. Security had everything tapped everywhere in a ship like this. Commander Delacroix and God knows who else were probably watching every little thing I did now. Before I could have faded into the backdrop of young, eager cadets. But now ... {&1310}\par I lost the little nerve and composure I had left and just started making all kinds of dumb mistakes for their amusement. {&1310}\par I started to wonder again if I should just stay home once I got there. There were a few cadets who had done that in the past. They were always disgraced, and one was even reassigned for regular enlistment because his family wasn't important or influential enough to get him out of it. I wondered if that would be better than \i this\i0 . Whatever \i this\i0  really was.{&1310}\par It was a mistake. Whatever Commander Delacroix thought about me. Whatever was going on. It was a mistake. It \i had\i0  to be. That sort of thing wouldn't just ... \i happen\i0 . Would it?{&1310}\par Why the \i hell\i0  would anyone want to keep a shitty cadet like me here? Everyone else was either trying to get rid of me or waiting until I flunked out. And why -- why, why, why, why! -- wouldn't Commander Delacroix know who it was? Why the fuck would she think \i I\i0  would know?{&1310}\par It didn't make any sense. It was a mistake.{&1310}\par \i That\i0  was the only thing that did make sense.{&1310}\par Komi tried to ask me about it. I was pretty sure that what the commander had said was meant to be confidential, and she probably hoped I'd be too terrified to tell anyone. I almost was. For a day or so. But I found myself unloading on Komi as soon as everything got so heavy that it was crushing me to pieces inside. I told her everything that the woman had said. Because I had to tell \i someone\i0 , and I sure as hell wasn't going to write home to Tess about it where someone -- probably Commander Delacroix! -- would see it. Komi took it all in without any better idea than me about what it meant.{&1310}\par "Well?" I had to blurt out to get her to answer me after telling her everything. She just sat there on her rack with this weird expression on her face, staring off into empty air. I thought she must have been doing that for a while and I'd just been so caught up I hadn't even noticed. So I snapped at her.{&1310}\par Komi blinked, and glanced up at me like she'd forgotten I was even there.{&1310}\par "What do you think? What should I do?" I demanded. She fixed on me in a distracted sort of way. What was wrong with her? This was fucking with \i me\i0 . And I needed an answer from someone -- \i anyone\i0 . About Commander Delacroix. Morisant. \i Everything\i0 .{&1310}\par "I," she started and, for the first time since I had known her -- I watched Komi hesitate. Actually second guess herself and what she must have been thinking. Sure, she'd gotten a little angry before, flustered, even ranted every so often when it was just me there and she was practically by herself but ... she'd always still been in control. Sure of herself and what she needed to do. Through everything -- she'd always had an answer for either herself, or for me. And I needed that now.{&1310}\par "I really don't know."{&1310}\par I stared at her for a few, long moments. {&1310}\par "What do you mean 'you\i  don't know\i0 '?"{&1310}\par I don't know why I was suddenly so mad at her like that. It wasn't her fault. The one time she didn't have an answer and I felt like I needed it most, but ... it wasn't her fault. I tried to calm down but I couldn't help it so I just threw my hands up and stalked away. The tiny bunkroom was too small to fit my wallowing frustration. It was like someone was trying to play a huge fucking game with my head and I had no idea what the point of it was supposed to be. Fear was turning to frustration and insanity began bubbling underneath. I didn't really know \i what\i0  I was supposed to even think about all of this anymore.{&1310}\par And all she can fucking say is "I REALLY DON'T KNOW?"?!{&1310}\par \i Calm\i0  \i down\i0 . \i It not her fault\i0 .{&1310}\par Well who's fault is it then?{&1310}\par Mine? Probably mine. Just like everything else. Just like-{&1310}\par "What's Project Arclight?"{&1310}\par I stopped abruptly. I didn't know why my head was spinning around so much. Talking about it out loud just seemed to make it worse, not better. I felt so powerless and confused and out of place here now that ... but Komi's question just cut right through the nagging silence outside my head. I stopped, and looked back at her.{&1310}\par "What?" It took me a second to wrap my scattered head around what she was even asking. Then my mouth just twisted up in frustration again. "How the hell should I know?"{&1310}\par She still had that deadpan, faraway look on her browned face. It was annoying. She shrugged in what felt like -- to me -- a forced way. I don't why I thought that, but I did.{&1310}\par "The commander of the academy wanted to know," she explained, as if I hadn't been the only reason she knew that. I'd \i told\i0  her that. "Maybe it's something important."{&1310}\par Something important. What a \i novel\i0  idea.{&1310}\par That was what my mouth wanted to say. But I managed to make it come out as, "I have \i no\i0  idea." I hadn't lied to Commander Delacroix about that and I wasn't lying now. I really had no reason to.{&1310}\par "She said it was before Riftwatch. How old were you when your family got there?"{&1310}\par I shook my head, sighing in a loud and irritated way I tried to but couldn't help. "I was \i born\i0  there," I snapped at her. The stress had finally caught up to me full force. You couldn't go six months in a place like this doing as poorly as I did without freaking out a little. And I felt like I was freaking out right now.{&1310}\par If I'd been in a better, less harried and ballistic state of mind, I might have realized there was no real way she could have known how ridiculous the whole thing was like I did until I told her. There \i was\i0  nothing before Riftwatch station -- not for me. I had the birth records to prove it, and even my earlist memory was at about two -- those reddish-purple flowers they grew in the central courtyards. They got their color from the light radiation coming off the Rift and they were probably the only thing about that place that was actually beautiful. I remembered them that day way too well to have made it up. There was a sect of horticulturists among the retired and veteran scientists that always seemed to make sure they stayed in bloom. \i Only\i0  on Riftwatch. Nowhere else.{&1310}\par "They do a lot of research projects for the Grand Admiral's there."{&1310}\par "So? So what?"{&1310}\par What was she getting at? Her tone was leading, I realized. She wasn't asking questions -- she was trying to push me somewhere. Why? She kept giving me these funny looks and now she was talking to me like this. Why?{&1310}\par She just shrugged. I thought about it some more like she seemed to want me to and I think I eventually got her meaning.{&1310}\par "You think someone might have experimented on me?"{&1310}\par I said that out loud and then I tried to laugh it off. I tried to convince myself it was impossible. But she just shrugged again, and it suddenly made me so mad all over again seeing her do that -- the thought of it -- the nanos in medbay ... I cringed. My skin crawled. Then I just forced myself to laugh again. It had to be the stupidest thing she could have suggested to me. It \i had\i0  to be.{&1310}\par Genetic experimentation. On \i me\i0 ! Of all people?{&1310}\par "You think I'd be so terrible at all of this if someone had?" I continued out loud, swinging a hand around and taking in the entire semester all at once. "Shouldn't I be, like, fucking awesome? Super strong, or fast, or smart?" And I wasn't any of those. There were procedures that could already do those sorts of things. The advanced training programs would expose psychokinetic applicants and certain specialists to them anyways. They were some risks, especially with any treatment that messed around too much inside your head. But it was well known, documented, and used all over the sector. No one needed to sneak anything new through me.{&1310}\par \i Me\i0 !{&1310}\par I wanted to laugh so hard but, for some reason, I just couldn't quit make myself do it.{&1310}\par "It wouldn't have had to be successful," Komi said then. "If it really was an experiment."{&1310}\par What she meant took awhile again to catch up with me. And I must have stared at her a little too dumbly after that or it was all she felt like saying about the whole thing, because the conversation petered out. Which was just as well because I was tired of it anyways. I couldn't remember why I thought Komi would be much help in the first place. She didn't know any more than I did and the whole thing just sort of frustrated me in a way I couldn't even explain. Komi seriously pissed me off for probably the first time ever, and it wasn't even her fault. I just couldn't talk to anyone right now. Something was wrong with \i me\i0 .{&1310}\par I needed to get away. So bad. I just really needed to get away from all this now.{&1310}\par I managed to hold out just a little bit longer until the day we shipped out for pre-finals leave came and found our whole platoon standing at attention around the squad bay in our smart uniforms, looking just like the soldiers most of us would become. Young, fresh, half-starved and raw. I looked around the room out of the corner of my eyes and felt out of place both physicall and mentally. The uniform felt too big, like I couldn't ever fill it. If anyone else was having the same problems as me, I couldn't see it. And why should they? They didn't have a creepy robot eye and vague death threats pushing in at the back of their head.{&1310}\par "Let me remind you, cadets."{&1310}\par Lieutenant Morisant was standing at the head of the squad bay with his sergeant instructors floating around him, mountains of hard-faced dispassion that could have snapped any single cadet that stepped out of line in a heartbeat. Gunny Abarca, the head instructor, stood at rest just a step behind the lieutenant's elbow, looking calm and in control.{&1310}\par Morisant started walking.{&1310}\par "We are at war with pirates who would like nothing more than to see all of us dead," he continued on, bellowing out loudly in his composed, authoritative voice. Like nothing could faze him. "Every single one of you was sent here because you are the pinnacle of human and battlefield evolution. All of \i you\i0  represent the future. And I expect you to act like it."{&1310}\par  He moved around so that he looked each of us in the eye where we stood up and down the squad bay as he spoke. The bodies of cadets bristled in sequence like a wave as he passed and that gaze took them in, measuring everything that we had been through the whole semester in a single glance.{&1310}\par "This academy is meant to hone the deadliest, most destructive weapons at the Grand Admirals' disposal. There is no room for error at the end of this program. An untrained psychokinetic is even more dangerous to his or her fellow soldiers than the enemy. When you graduate -- \i if\i0  you graduate -- you will be an instrument of discipline and control. Or you will be destroyed. Not by the enemy. By your fellow officers.{&1310}\par "When you leave this ship, you will take that long ride back home to think about all that you've learned and done here. What you've seen of yourselves. And what will come. This was the easy part. If you graduate, it's war from here on out."{&1310}\par He said the last as he slowed down. His heels clicked together and he turned toward the next cadet. I realized without enough fanfare that it was actually me.{&1310}\par No one had looked the lieutenant in the eye. Everyone had stared straight ahead and through him. I'd watched. I'd sat there feeling like all my courage and mental fortitude had finally been exhausted. I wanted to say that I didn't care anymore. That would've made it easy. Easi\i er\i0 . But I was just tired. I just wanted to get away from this -- from \i all\i0  of this. Maybe forever.{&1310}\par I looked him in the eye. It wasn't brave or defiant. I just felt his weighing gaze on me like the others, only with me it was demanding me look back. I don't know what I saw there in his flint-like, beaten eyes. He'd seen combat. He had the look that everyone talked about wanting. He had that look in his eyes and he was communicating something silently to me that was different than every other cadet in the room.{&1310}\par But all he said was: "Be ready."{&1310}\par Then he moved on, and I felt dead to the world again.\cf2\f2 {&1310}\par }{&1310}
