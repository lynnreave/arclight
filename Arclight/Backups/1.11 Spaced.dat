It slashed at me through the crack. Something caught in my side. Then more blood was spilling into the air.{&1310}\par I flung back. It howled, rearing and clawing at the door like a rabig animal.

It seared the door with a black scorch mark and a whiff of ash. The next was better, though. And so was the next after that.{&1310}\par Bolts of fire hammered into the fleshy space between those doors. The things kept howling and screaming their throat-rending screams out at me.

They just kept coming.{&1310}\par Holes appeared in the door. It was already bent out of shape.{&1310}\par I guess I got lucky with one of thsoe wild shots. And I guess they liked bigger viewports ont he upper deck cabins. Because one of those bolts went wide again and through. And must have hit glass. Because the whole room suddenly decompressed.{&1310}\par Wind abruptly whipped through the room, howling like all the demons in hell. Those things peeled away one at a time, still screaming above it. The air came alive in the corridor beyond and yanked me next. I went hurtling toward the doors agian and one of those fleshy maws still thrashing. I hit it with both feet and it flew away back into the room.{&1310}\par It tried to suck me through the crack in the door, screaming all the way. It got me about halfway. Then I stuck. Hard. And it didn't stop trying.{&1310}\par It was the worst pain I had ever felt in my life.{&1310}\par I nearly passed out before safety shields slipped down over the breach. My whole world was a narrow, black tunnel when I could breathe again. And I was still stuck fast in the twisted door. It was still trying to cut me in half.{&1310}\par I got my hands between either side. Somehow. I couldn't breathe. I tried to push with frantic fingers. But there was no leverage wedged in between them like that. And I suddenly had the terrible thought of being crushed in two there flash through my whole brain. That woke me up all the way in an instant.{&1310}\par I'm not sure how I did it. But I got those doors another inch. Just enough to suck in everything I had left and squeeze my way back out again. And by the time I could breathe right, that was all I did for the longest time, floating there in the dark, red light.{&1310}\par I laid there too long. It was hard not to. Just like any other corpse onboard that ship right now. Maybe they would miss me.{&1310}\par Just like dad.{&1310}\par Something caught my eye. A sign. On the wall.

I could just make them out.{&1310}\par EMERGENCY LIFEPODS.{&1310}\par Dad had said to get off the ship. I guess my luck wasn't so bad after all.{&1310}\par A hand caught the door next to that sign. I wedged bloody fingers in between and pushed those open too. Yanked out the floating corpse of a small boy from inside. Then I was staring down a ladder well.{&1310}\par One of those things scurried past down below. {&1310}\par I twisted back with a jerk, squeezing my eyes shut and choking on my tongue. {&1310}\par I sucked in a few ragged breaths there in the dark. Waited. And when I looked back, it was gone. A moment later, I upended, pulling myself down toward the bottom.{&1310}\par My hands were still shaking when I peeked out from the ceiling. The knuckles were white around the gun in one, fingers in a death grip on the pistol. I didn't see any sign of those things. But I could still hear them. Fortunately, for me, another of those signs pointed to the lifepods in a hallway just ahead.{&1310}\par I pushed my way out of the ladder well, and someone grabbed my hand.{&1310}\par I twisted around without thinking. A foot and the gun whipped that way both. And I would have fire too. If it hadn't been dad hanging there right then.{&1310}\par "\i Evelyn\i0 !"{&1310}\par I froze up, wide-eyed. He choked up some blood, rasping. His guts were still leaking too. There was a trail of droplets leading all the way back down that hall.{&1310}\par He pointed feebly ahead. "Over there," he gasped out at me. "Now!"{&1310}\par I caught him then, pulling him close. If we had been anywhere else, I couldn't have let go. I didn't. But I did start pulling us both toward one of those lifepods. For the first time, I ignored the sound of those things stalking the decks.{&1310}\par I helped dad inside without a word. And we closed the hatch shut behind us.{&1310}\par "That console," he managed, directing me. For once, I just did what I was told as he coughed out the launch sequence. It was simple enough. And by the time we were done, the whole pod lurched. Then we were flying free.{&1310}\par I never got to see that ship before we boarded. But I got a good look at it as we jettisoned away. One of those large transports to the bigger colonies or spaceports. It was floating dead in space now on its side like a rotting fish. All because of me.{&1310}\par "Evelyn ..."{&1310}\par Dad's voice brought me back around. He could barely speak. Not that that stopped him. He stabbed me with those piercing eyes - filmy now - and made me listen.{&1310}\par "The pod will find the," his face twisted abruptly, "nearest planet or moon on its own." The big black spot on his stomach wasn't leaking so much anymore. "Lyricum. I think. We should have been that far ... at least ..."{&1310}\par He started to drift away from me, eyes losing that hard light as they fell aside. I dove across the cramped compartment, though, and shook him back awake. He grimaced up at me, and started right in again without missing a beat.{&1310}\par "There is an outpost there," he told me, fainter this time. "Jerod, and Alarra. Jerod ... and Alarra. You must find them there ..." {&1310}\par His eyes began to droop again, and I clutched tighter, digging into his arms.  He couldn't even look up at my tear-streaked face. And I couldn't think of anything to say to make him.{&1310}\par "I hoped they wouldn't find you so soon," he mumbled on, not seeing me anymore. "I was so ... careful," he gagged abruptly. More blood spilled out into the air passed his lips. "Twenty years ..."{&1310}\par Wet, hacking coughs racked his old body then. He spit up blood, and I just tried not to get it right in my face. I was already drenched. I didn't want his too. {&1310}\par "I'm so sorry, Evelyn," he managed at the last, between coughing and choking on his own words. He rattled off a few more breaths, eyes squeezed shut. But he didn't speak again. And we must have hit something after that. Because the whole pod tried to shake itself apart.\cf2\f2 {&1310}\par }{&1310}

I only noticed because I was suddenly tumbling into the air.{&1310}\par My whole body spun. Some blood from the deck bobbed along with me. And when I came back around vertiical once more, a headless corpse did too.{&1310}\par We both hit a wall. I kicked out frantically with both feet, and it whirled away. I did too, whipping through black space. I smacked the bulkhead with my head and saw stars. It was the brightest the world had been in the last few minutes.{&1310}\par The rest of it came back. Slowly.{&1310}\par I had to get off that ship. That's what dad had said right before he ... I had to get off that ship. But I had no idea where I even was.{&1310}\par There were more of those things. I could hear them. There must have been a lot of people onboard because the screaming never ended. Whenever it died off somewhere, someone else took up the cry. If the dark didn't get me killed, my eyes would. I couldn't keep tears from blinding them.{&1310}\par I swam forward, lashing out with my blood-stained hands for anything along the way and pulling myself along through the black and low, red light. My chest shook - the only sound in the dark around me. I couldn't make it stop. I tried. {&1310}\par I hit another door. Spun myself around. And grabbed at the crack between them. I started prying them open, still wracked with shaking sobs that wouldn't go away. Just enough to peek into the next passageway.{&1310}\par Something leapt at my face.{&1310}\par That skin-ripping scream. I choked on my tongue, or else I would have screamed too. It slashed at me through the crack. Something caught in my side. Then more blood was spilling into the air.{&1310}\par I flung back. It howled, rearing and clawing at the door like a rabig animal. And it wasn't alone. There was a whole other cabin out there. Not another corridor. Half a dozen of those things were suddenly flying and ripping at the metal between them and me.{&1310}\par The door bent. Huge dents popped back in places. That warbling scream turned into a crescendo, making my ears bleed. I screamed too this time.{&1310}\par Somehow, through all of it, my hand found the gun in my jacket pocket. It was still there. I lost everything and everyone else - but I still had that. And I stabbed it out at them without another thought.{&1310}\par I yawked on the trigger, and ...{&1310}\par Nothing.{&1310}\par Again.{&1310}\par Nothing.{&1310}\par Razored limbs whipped out like a frenzied mass of tentacles at the door.{&1310}\par I think I screamed again. But no sound came out this time. Or they just drowned me out. I might have just thrown the pistol at them too. But I remembered soemthing then. For once in my entire life, I remembered something someone had told me right when it mattered.{&1310}\par I clicked the safety off - Bertram had switched it back on - and fired.{&1310}\par This time, light flashed bright in the dark.{&1310}\par That first shot went wide. It seared the door with a black scorch mark and a whiff of ash. The next was better, though. And so was the next after that.{&1310}\par Bolts of fire hammered into the fleshy space between those doors. The things kept howling and screaming their throat-rending screams out at me. One fell back. Maybe. It was hard to tell in the dark. They thrashed so much. For all the good it seemed to do, those things barely noticed. They just kept coming.{&1310}\par Holes appeared in the door. It was already bent out of shape.{&1310}\par I guess I got lucky with one of thsoe wild shots. And I guess they liked bigger viewports ont he upper deck cabins. Because one of those bolts went wide again and through. And must have hit glass. Because the whole room suddenly decompressed.{&1310}\par Wind abruptly whipped through the room, howling like all the demons in hell. Those things peeled away one at a time, still screaming above it. The air came alive in the corridor beyond and yanked me next. I went hurtling toward the doors agian and one of those fleshy maws still thrashing. I hit it with both feet and it flew away back into the room.{&1310}\par It tried to suck me through the crack in the door, screaming all the way. It got me about halfway. Then I stuck. Hard. And it didn't stop trying.{&1310}\par It was the worst pain I had ever felt in my life.{&1310}\par I nearly passed out before safety shields slipped down over the breach. My whole world was a narrow, black tunnel when I could breathe again. And I was still stuck fast in the twisted door. It was still trying to cut me in half.{&1310}\par I got my hands between either side. Somehow. I couldn't breathe. I tried to push with frantic fingers. But there was no leverage wedged in between them like that. And I suddenly had the terrible thought of being crushed in two there flash through my whole brain. That woke me up all the way in an instant.{&1310}\par I'm not sure how I did it. But I got those doors another inch. Just enough to suck in everything I had left and squeeze my way back out again. And by the time I could breathe right, that was all I did for the longest time, floating there in the dark, red light.{&1310}\par I laid there too long. It was hard not to. Just like any other corpse onboard that ship right now. Maybe they would miss me.{&1310}\par Just like dad.{&1310}\par Something caught my eye. A sign. On the wall. The letters were illuminated int hat same red emergency light. But they were covered in black blood. I could just make them out.{&1310}\par EMERGENCY LIFEPODS.{&1310}\par Dad had said to get off the ship. I guess my luck wasn't so bad after all.{&1310}\par A hand caught the door next to that sign. I wedged bloody fingers in between and pushed those open too. Yanked out the floating corpse of a small boy from inside. Then I was staring down a ladder well.{&1310}\par One of those things scurried past down below. {&1310}\par I twisted back with a jerk, squeezing my eyes shut and choking on my tongue. {&1310}\par I sucked in a few ragged breaths there in the dark. Waited. And when I looked back, it was gone. A moment later, I upended, pulling myself down toward the bottom.{&1310}\par My hands were still shaking when I peeked out from the ceiling. The knuckles were white around the gun in one, fingers in a death grip on the pistol. I didn't see any sign of those things. But I could still hear them. Fortunately, for me, another of those signs pointed to the lifepods in a hallway just ahead.{&1310}\par I pushed my way out of the ladder well, and someone grabbed my hand.{&1310}\par I twisted around without thinking. A foot and the gun whipped that way both. And I would have fire too. If it hadn't been dad hanging there right then.{&1310}\par "\i Evelyn\i0 !"{&1310}\par I froze up, wide-eyed. He choked up some blood, rasping. His guts were still leaking too. There was a trail of droplets leading all the way back down that hall.{&1310}\par He pointed feebly ahead. "Over there," he gasped out at me. "Now!"{&1310}\par I caught him then, pulling him close. If we had been anywhere else, I couldn't have let go. I didn't. But I did start pulling us both toward one of those lifepods. For the first time, I ignored the sound of those things stalking the decks.{&1310}\par I helped dad inside without a word. And we closed the hatch shut behind us.{&1310}\par "That console," he managed, directing me. For once, I just did what I was told as he coughed out the launch sequence. It was simple enough. And by the time we were done, the whole pod lurched. Then we were flying free.{&1310}\par I never got to see that ship before we boarded. But I got a good look at it as we jettisoned away. One of those large transports to the bigger colonies or spaceports. It was floating dead in space now on its side like a rotting fish. All because of me.{&1310}\par "Evelyn ..."{&1310}\par Dad's voice brought me back around. He could barely speak. Not that that stopped him. He stabbed me with those piercing eyes - filmy now - and made me listen.{&1310}\par "The pod will find the," his face twisted abruptly, "nearest planet or moon on its own." The big black spot on his stomach wasn't leaking so much anymore. "Lyricum. I think. We should have been that far ... at least ..."{&1310}\par He started to drift away from me, eyes losing that hard light as they fell aside. I dove across the cramped compartment, though, and shook him back awake. He grimaced up at me, and started right in again without missing a beat.{&1310}\par "There is an outpost there," he told me, fainter this time. "Jerod, and Alarra. Jerod ... and Alarra. You must find them there ..." {&1310}\par His eyes began to droop again, and I clutched tighter, digging into his arms.  He couldn't even look up at my tear-streaked face. And I couldn't think of anything to say to make him.{&1310}\par "I hoped they wouldn't find you so soon," he mumbled on, not seeing me anymore. "I was so ... careful," he gagged abruptly. More blood spilled out into the air passed his lips. "Twenty years ..."{&1310}\par Wet, hacking coughs racked his old body then. He spit up blood, and I just tried not to get it right in my face.
