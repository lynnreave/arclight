Not that there was anything to clean up for, but it was hard not to enjoy being able to bathe regularly after the transport cruiser and getting lost in the wilderness. As small as it was, Richter's shower didn't look half as dated as Matthias' back in Shtess.{&1310}\par "What's that?" Tess abruptly butted in from behind, pointing at what the man had carried in under one arm.{&1310}\par "Oh." He glanced down at the bundle before holding it up for us. "They're the latest from Dreggoran, and quite popular right now. They should help you fit in better if we go to the port again."{&1310}\par "What do you mean 'if'? Ugh."{&1310}\par Tess made a sound in her throat as her face twisted. She unfolded the coat she'd snatched from him, looking less than happy about wearing it. It certainly didn't compare to the clothes she usually liked to throw on.{&1310}\par Richter handed me the other one and I unfolded it to see what Tess didn't like. It was long, tight-fighting, and fairly starched compared to what we were used to back home. The neck was high, and it was a stark, conservative black. Plain and utilitarian, but still a little elegant with those fine scrolls on the hem you almost didn't notice. It was subtle. Not really Tess' style at all.{&1310}\par I hadn't paid much attention to Dreggoran fashion in the vids, but it seemed to fit, and most of the people around there wore something similar at least. I supposed wearing those things would make us a bit less noticeable anyways. {&1310}\par "Hey, Ev ... look."{&1310}\par I glanced over at Tess having slipped into her Dreggoran coat. Or I guess that wasn't quite right. She'd done it up so tight it looked more like someone had \i stuffed \i0 her into it.{&1310}\par "Tax evasion is treason!" she stood stock still with a too-somber, too-earnest look on her spaced-out face. "All men twenty years or older must register with the DFB for mandatory enlistment!"{&1310}\par I laughed. Richter didn't. His face flushed bright red beneath his flaxen hair like he'd been embarassed. We'd been seeing those government-sponsored messages for days popping up ever fifteen minutes or so during broadcasts. I'd mostly tuned them out.{&1310}\par "Sectarians!" he snapped, looking awkward even doing that like he suddenly had all that anger and wasn't sure just what to even do with it. His lip quivered as he ranted. "It might all be a big ... \i fucking \i0 ... joke to you," he sputtered, "But you - you won't be laughing the day the Grand Admirals decide to throw your part of the sector to the void!"{&1310}\par He glared at us both, flushed and angry. Our laughter died down into ragged, punctuated peals. I looked at Tess.{&1310}\par "What got him so mad?"{&1310}\par She shrugged.{&1310}\par "I couldn't hear him over this collar!" {&1310}\par She pretened to gasp, pulling at the thing tight on her neck with her fingers. I lost it again.{&1310}\par Richter eventually had enough and stormed off to the side of the room that served as both the kitchen and dining room. Tess and I kept laughing for a bit at his expense while he downed some of that non-alcoholic tonic he seemed to love so much, still looking embarassed and put off. For a few minutes, I forgot everything else that had happened, and it was just like being back home. For a few minutes.{&1310}\par Then there was a chime at the door, and everyone froze.{&1310}\par For a moment - nothing. Just me and Tess and that blonde-haired man staring with wide, surprised eyes at each other around Richter's apartment. Then:{&1310}\par "Hallo! Officer Herman Richter?"{&1310}\par The voice was brusque and soulless through the metal-paneled door. We all looked at it, and that was about it for a minute. No one had ever come to the door before. For a minute, I kind of just thought I'd imagined it.{&1310}\par "Hey!" the man on the other side shouted and chimed insistently again. "Internal Investigations Division, yeah? Open the door, please!"{&1310}\par Richter swung past us before I could blink. He looked around, hesitating, like he would figure something out from that unkempt, tiny room. That hesitation lasted painfully long, and I could feel the seconds crawling by toward eternity in my head. Eventually, he snapped out of it and gave us an ashen look as he walked the rest of the short way to the door.{&1310}\par "Yeah?" He said, clicking a button on the call panel to the side. "Who's calling, please?"{&1310}\par Some muffled talking on the other side. There was more than one out there.{&1310}\par "Officer Richter? IID," the voice said. "Could you let us in please?"{&1310}\par "Yeah."{&1310}\par He threw a desperate hand our way, and me and Tess jumped at the bathroom door like he'd shot a gun at us. We ducked inside without making too much noise, but Tess nearly tripped over me doing it and Richter winced visibly at the door. Tess scrambled over into the shower stall while I stayed behind the bathroom door, peeking out into the main room.{&1310}\par Richter punched a command into the panel and the front door slid open. I waited for whoever it was to push their way aside, but Richter just spoke to them quietly while nodding his head every so often. I got paranoid waiting. No one had come around to his apartment since we'd gotten there, and I had flashes in my head of what that really meant. Internal Investigations?  I could guess at what that was all about. And we'd been outside for the first time to the skyhook yesterday - {&1310}\par Oh, shit.{&1310}\par My pistol was with my coat on the floor. I saw it, and felt ice pour down my back.{&1310}\par Shit!{&1310}\par I looked back at the shower stall where Tess was crouched down and peering out of the dark. She mouthed something at me, but I just shook my head without understanding or caring.{&1310}\par How could I be so \i stupid\i0 ?{&1310}\par When I came back around, someone else was standing in the room.{&1310}\par Richter had a coughing fit. Angry, and nerve-wracking so that he collapsed into the wall beside the man. It bought me a second or two to duck all the way out of sight while that other man took a step back, giving Richter a scornful look.{&1310}\par "Are you quite alright, Officer?" a second man demanded, stepping into the apartment. That one focused on Richter while the other was looking around. "We've had some concerns with certain discrepancies on your latest shift reports with the DMTC."{&1310}\par They both wore the same black, high-necked outfit. There was protective fiberweave built into the synthetic. I wasn't sure what that was all about. Not even the Watchmen back home needed to wear that much protection on duty.{&1310}\par Richter just nodded, recovering himself somewhat. "I've been a touch, uhh, under the weather for some days now," he managed.{&1310}\par I could just barely keep an eye out into the room past the edge of the sliding bathroom door, but it was enough to see the first man pouring over the few belongings on the floor and scattered about. My jacket was one of them. And so were those two coats.{&1310}\par "You live alone here, Officer Richter?" he asked, glancing back. "No one else resides with you?"{&1310}\par Richter quickly shook his head, but I could tell the man already knew the answer as soon as he asked. They actually were a little like the Watchmen back home, I thought. So they probably wouldn't have come unless they already knew everything they needed to about him.{&1310}\par There was color rising in Richter's cheeks to wash away the palor he'd been suffering from since those men showed up.{&1310}\par "Not a - girlfriend, perhaps?" the one man was holding up my jacket. I didn't like the dead look in his eyes as he did it. It was worse than the ones I used to get back home.{&1310}\par But then they noticed the blood.{&1310}\par {&1310}\par }{&1310}

He looked around, hesitating, like he would figure something out from that unkempt, tiny room. That hesitation lasted painfully long, and I could feel the seconds crawling by toward eternity in my head. Eventually, he snapped out of it and gave us an ashen look as he walked the rest of the short way to the door.{&1310}\par "Yeah?" He said, clicking a button on the call panel to the side. "Who's calling, please?"{&1310}\par Some muffled talking on the other side. There was more than one out there.{&1310}\par "Officer Richter? IID," the voice said. "Could you let us in please?"{&1310}\par "Yeah."{&1310}\par He threw a desperate hand our way, and me and Tess jumped at the bathroom door like he'd shot a gun at us. We ducked inside without making too much noise, but Tess nearly tripped over me doing it and Richter winced visibly at the door. Tess scrambled over into the shower stall while I stayed behind the bathroom door, peeking out into the main room.{&1310}\par Richter punched a command into the panel and the front door slid open. I waited for whoever it was to push their way aside, but Richter just spoke to them quietly while nodding his head every so often. I got paranoid waiting. No one had come around to his apartment since we'd gotten there, and I had flashes in my head of what that really meant. Internal Investigations?  I could guess at what that was all about. And we'd been outside for the first time to the skyhook yesterday - {&1310}\par Oh, shit.{&1310}\par My pistol was with my coat on the floor. I saw it, and felt ice pour down my back.{&1310}\par Shit!{&1310}\par I looked back at the shower stall where Tess was crouched down and peering out of the dark. She mouthed something at me, but I just shook my head without understanding or caring.{&1310}\par How could I be so \i stupid\i0 ?{&1310}\par When I came back around, someone else was standing in the room.{&1310}\par Richter had a coughing fit. Angry, and nerve-wracking so that he collapsed into the wall beside the man. It bought me a second or two to duck all the way out of sight while that other man took a step back, giving Richter a scornful look.{&1310}\par "Are you quite alright, Officer?" a second man demanded, stepping into the apartment. That one focused on Richter while the other was looking around. "We've had some concerns with certain discrepancies on your latest shift reports with the DMTC."{&1310}\par They both wore the same black, high-necked outfit. There was protective fiberweave built into the synthetic. I wasn't sure what that was all about. Not even the Watchmen back home needed to wear that much protection on duty.{&1310}\par Richter just nodded, recovering himself somewhat. "I've been a touch, uhhh, under the weather for some days now," he managed.{&1310}\par I could just barely keep an eye out into the room past the edge of the sliding bathroom door, but it was enough to see the first man pouring over the few belongings on the floor and scattered about. My jacket was one of them. And so were those two coats.{&1310}\par "You live alone here, Officer Richter?" he asked, glancing back. "No one else resides with you?"{&1310}\par Richter quickly shook his head, but I could tell the man already knew the answer as soon as he asked. They actually were a little like the Watchmen back home, I thought. So they probably wouldn't have come unless they already knew everything they needed to about him.{&1310}\par There was color rising in Richter's cheeks to wash away the palor he'd been suffering from since those men showed up.{&1310}\par "Not a - girlfriend, perhaps?" the one man was holding up my jacket. I didn't like the dead look in his eyes as he did it. It was worse than the ones I used to get back home.{&1310}\par But then they noticed the blood.{&1310}\par {&1310}\par }{&1310}

Not that there was anything to clean up for, but it was hard not to enjoy being able to bathe regularly after the transport cruiser and getting lost in the wilderness. As small as it was, Richter's shower didn't look half as dated as Matthias' back in Shtess.{&1310}\par "What's that?" Tess abruptly butted in from behind, pointing at what the man had carried in under one arm.{&1310}\par "Oh." He glanced down at the bundle before holding it up for us. "They're the latest from Dreggoran, and quite popular right now. They should help you fit in better if we go to the port again."{&1310}\par "What do you mean 'if'? Ugh."{&1310}\par Tess made a sound in her throat as her face twisted. She unfolded the coat she'd snatched from him, looking less than happy about wearing it. It certainly didn't compare to the clothes she usually liked to throw on.{&1310}\par Richter handed me the other one and I unfolded it to see what Tess didn't like. It was long, tight-fighting, and fairly starched compared to what we were used to back home. The neck was high, and it was a stark, conservative black. Plain and utilitarian, but still a little elegant with those fine scrolls on the hem you almost didn't notice. It was subtle. Not really Tess' style at all.{&1310}\par I hadn't paid much attention to Dreggoran fashion in the vids, but it seemed to fit, and most of the people around there wore something similar at least. I supposed wearing those things would make us a bit less noticeable anyways. {&1310}\par "Hey, Ev ... look."{&1310}\par I glanced over at Tess having slipped into her Dreggoran coat. Or I guess that wasn't quite right. She'd done it up so tight it looked more like someone had \i stuffed \i0 her into it.{&1310}\par "Tax evasion is treason!" she stood stock still with a too-somber, too-earnest look on her spaced-out face. "All men twenty years or older must register with the DFB for mandatory enlistment!"{&1310}\par I laughed. Richter didn't. His face flushed bright red beneath his flaxen hair like he'd been embarassed. We'd been seeing those government-sponsored messages for days popping up ever fifteen minutes or so during broadcasts. I'd mostly tuned them out.{&1310}\par "Sectarians!" he snapped, looking awkward even doing that like he suddenly had all that anger and wasn't sure just what to even do with it. His lip quivered as he ranted. "It might all be a big ... \i fucking \i0 ... joke to you," he sputtered, "But you - you won't be laughing the day the Grand Admirals decide to throw your part of the sector to the void!"{&1310}\par He glared at us both, flushed and angry. Our laughter died down into ragged, punctuated peals. I looked at Tess.{&1310}\par "What got him so mad?"{&1310}\par She shrugged.{&1310}\par "I couldn't hear him over this collar!" {&1310}\par She pretened to gasp, pulling at the thing tight on her neck with her fingers. I lost it again.{&1310}\par Richter eventually had enough and stormed off to the side of the room that served as both the kitchen and dining room. Tess and I kept laughing for a bit at his expense while he downed some of that non-alcoholic tonic he seemed to love so much, still looking embarassed and put off. For a few minutes, I forgot everything else that had happened, and it was just like being back home. For a few minutes.{&1310}\par Then there was a chime at the door, and everyone froze.{&1310}\par For a moment - nothing. Just me and Tess and that blonde-haired man staring with wide, surprised eyes at each other around Richter's apartment. Then:{&1310}\par "Hallo! Officer Herman Richter?"{&1310}\par The voice was brusque and soulless through the metal-paneled door. We all looked at it, and that was about it for a minute.

Not that there was anything to clean up for, but it was hard not to enjoy being able to bathe regularly after the transport cruiser and getting lost in the wilderness. As small as it was, Richter's shower didn't look half as dated as Matthias' back in Shtess.{&1310}\par "What's that?" Tess abruptly butted in from behind, pointing at what the man had carried in under one arm.{&1310}\par "Oh." He glanced down at the bundle before holding it up for us. "They're the latest from Dreggoran, and quite popular right now. They should help you fit in better if we go to the port again."{&1310}\par "What do you mean 'if'? Ugh."{&1310}\par Tess made a sound in her throat as her face twisted. She unfolded the coat she'd snatched from him, looking less than happy about wearing it. It certainly didn't compare to the clothes she usually liked to throw on.{&1310}\par Richter handed me the other one and I unfolded it to see what Tess didn't like. It was long, tight-fighting, and fairly starched compared to what we were used to back home. The neck was high, and it was a stark, conservative black. Plain and utilitarian, but still a little elegant with those fine scrolls on the hem you almost didn't notice. It was subtle. Not really Tess' style at all.{&1310}\par I hadn't paid much attention to Dreggoran fashion in the vids, but it seemed to fit, and most of the people around there wore something similar at least. I supposed wearing those things would make us a bit less noticeable anyways. {&1310}\par "Hey, Ev ... look."{&1310}\par I glanced over at Tess having slipped into her Dreggoran coat. Or I guess that wasn't quite right. She'd done it up so tight it looked more like someone had \i stuffed \i0 her into it.{&1310}\par "Tax evasion is treason!" she stood stock still with a too-somber, too-earnest look on her spaced-out face. "All men twenty years or older must register with the DFB for mandatory enlistment!"{&1310}\par I laughed. Richter didn't. His face flushed bright red beneath his flaxen hair like he'd been embarassed. We'd been seeing those government-sponsored messages for days popping up ever fifteen minutes or so during broadcasts. I'd mostly tuned them out.{&1310}\par "Sectarians!" he snapped, looking awkward even doing that like he suddenly had all that anger and wasn't sure just what to even do with it. His lip quivered as he ranted. "It might all be a big ... \i fucking \i0 ... joke to you," he sputtered, "But you - you won't be laughing the day the Grand Admirals decide to throw your part of the sector to the void!"{&1310}\par He glared at us both, flushed and angry. Our laughter died down into ragged, punctuated peals. I looked at Tess.{&1310}\par "What got him so mad?"{&1310}\par She shrugged.{&1310}\par "I couldn't hear him over this collar!" {&1310}\par She pretened to gasp, pulling at the thing tight on her neck with her fingers. I lost it again.{&1310}\par Richter eventually had enough and stormed off to the side of the room that served as both the kitchen and dining room. Tess and I kept laughing for a bit at his expense while he downed some of that non-alcoholic tonic he seemed to love so much, still looking embarassed and put off. For a few minutes, I forgot everything else that had happened, and it was just like being back home. For a few minutes.{&1310}\par Then there was a chime at the door, and everyone froze.{&1310}\par For a moment - nothing. Just me and Tess and that blonde-haired man staring with wide, surprised eyes at each other around Richter's apartment. Then:{&1310}\par "Hallo! Officer Herman Richter?"{&1310}\par The voice was brusque and soulless through the metal-paneled door. We all looked at it, and that was about it for a minute. No one had ever come to the door before. For a minute, I kind of just thought I'd imagined it.{&1310}\par "Hey!" the man on the other side shouted and chimed insistently again. "Internal Investigations Division, yeah? Open the door, please!"{&1310}\par Richter swung past us before I could blink. He looked around, hesitating, like he would figure something out from that unkempt, tiny room. That hesitation lasted painfully long, and I could feel the seconds crawling by toward eternity in my head. Eventually, he snapped out of it and gave us an ashen look as he walked the rest of the short way to the door.{&1310}\par "Yeah?" He said, clicking a button on the call panel to the side. "Who's calling, please?"{&1310}\par Some muffled talking on the other side. There was more than one out there.{&1310}\par "Officer Richter? IID," the voice said. "Could you let us in please?"{&1310}\par "Yeah."{&1310}\par He threw a desperate hand our way, and me and Tess jumped at the bathroom door like he'd shot a gun at us. We ducked inside without making too much noise, but Tess nearly tripped over me doing it and Richter winced visibly at the door. Tess scrambled over into the shower stall while I stayed behind the bathroom door, peeking out into the main room.{&1310}\par Richter punched a command into the panel and the front door slid open. I waited for whoever it was to push their way aside, but Richter just spoke to them quietly while nodding his head every so often. I got paranoid waiting. No one had come around to his apartment since we'd gotten there, and I had flashes in my head of what that really meant. Internal Investigations?  I could guess at what that was all about. And we'd been outside for the first time to the skyhook yesterday - {&1310}\par Oh, shit.{&1310}\par My pistol was with my coat on the floor. I saw it, and felt ice pour down my back.{&1310}\par Shit!{&1310}\par I looked back at the shower stall where Tess was crouched down and peering out of the dark. She mouthed something at me, but I just shook my head without understanding or caring.{&1310}\par How could I be so \i stupid\i0 ?{&1310}\par When I came back around, someone else was standing in the room.{&1310}\par Richter had a coughing fit. Angry, and nerve-wracking so that he collapsed into the wall beside the man. It bought me a second or two to duck all the way out of sight while that other man took a step back, giving Richter a scornful look.{&1310}\par "Are you quite alright, Officer?" a second man demanded, stepping into the apartment. That one focused on Richter while the other was looking around. "We've had some concerns with certain discrepancies on your latest shift reports with the DMTC."{&1310}\par They both wore the same black, high-necked outfit. There was protective fiberweave built into the synthetic. I wasn't sure what that was all about. Not even the Watchmen back home needed to wear that much protection on duty.{&1310}\par Richter just nodded, recovering himself somewhat. "I've been a touch, ahh, under the weather for some days now," he managed.{&1310}\par I could just barely keep an eye out into the room past the edge of the sliding bathroom door, but it was enough to see the first man pouring over the few belongings on the floor and scattered about. My jacket was one of them. And so were those two coats.{&1310}\par "You live alone here, Officer Richter?" he asked, glancing back. "No one else resides with you?"{&1310}\par Richter quickly shook his head, but I could tell the man already knew the answer as soon as he asked. They actually were a little like the Watchmen back home, I thought. So they probably wouldn't have come unless they already knew everything they needed to about him.{&1310}\par There was color rising in Richter's cheeks to wash away the palor he'd been suffering from since those men showed up.{&1310}\par "Not a - girlfriend, perhaps?" the one man was holding up my jacket. I didn't like the dead look in his eyes as he did it. It was worse than the ones I used to get back home.{&1310}\par But then they noticed the blood.{&1310}\par {&1310}\par }{&1310}
