It was hard to tell whether that was just the atmosphere, or something else altogether. It started to gnaw at the flesh after a while - settling in with a chill deep in the bones. It eroded courage and conviction. Reasoning became less sound the more the eyes began to fail. We started jumping at shadows, and snapping at those still living. And they were becoming precious few.{&1310}\par The wind was cold. It might have been night, or it might have been day -- everyone left had given up on figuring that out some time ago, along with everything else. It didn't seem so important anymore. Not with the way anyone slow, dazed, or unlucky enough didn't last very long anyways.{&1310}\par How long had it been now?{&1310}\par Days?{&1310}\par Weeks?{&1310}\par It was one, long endless night in the dark. The air was thick, and damp, and it felt claustrophobic out here amongst the black trees and the vanished dead even though the forest went on forever. You'd think the terraforming engineers would have a harder time growing the things so real way out on a blasted, lifeless rock like this. You'd think they'd only bother with an illusion, just to satisfy the creature comforts and the bottom line. You'd think a lot of things after days of running on adrenaline and no shut-eye. Pratt had whispered to me once -- in the dark like the dead twilight before morning with the vapor of his stale breath clouding on the side of my face since we barely dared speak out loud anymore -- that he thought this is what it must have been like to get lost inside Hell.{&1310}\par It was the fear.{&1310}\par If there really had ever been an original mission statement and this all wasn't just some, elaborate nightmare -- it had said two days. Two days from the LOD outside the drop point. Two days to get as far as we did, or were supposed to.{&1310}\par It had been at least two days since we'd lost Ericks.{&1310}\par There was light enough, anyways -- if you felt like risking it. The problem was that it always attracted something much worse than the dark. We'd found that out quickly enough in those first few hours on the move.{&1310}\par Light discipline.{&1310}\par That was what LT had called for soon after Dowager had lit up off in the bush and got himself swallowed whole before anyone else even knew what'd happened. The rest of his team too, when they went flying off after him in a rush with lights. Gone without a trace. At least, the ones who'd been carrying flashlights. Only Briggs had been left -- shivering and traumatized by himself in the dark. Whatever got them, they'd snatched another guy away right next to him. He was the only one without a light.{&1310}\par He had the rest of the guys' blood all over to keep \i him \i0 warm.{&1310}\par LT figured it out real quick. He had that idea anyways. A smart guy, Lieutenant Fletcher. And right about one thing, at least. We didn't lose anymore for a while after that. So it must have proved his point.{&1310}\par Fletcher tried to get the captain up on the horn after that while we held position with as close to three-sixty security as we could get, spread out in the black woods. No luck, though. Some kind of communications blackout, maybe. Odd that it would happen so quickly on a covert search and destroy op. But it did. And all that poor bastard holding the comm got for his trouble was to be the next one dragged off into the dark.{&1310}\par We were supposed to keep fire discipline too. Weapons were loaded, but any live fire would have given us away. Between third team's sudden vanishing act to a chorus of terrified screams, no communications, and a corporal carrying a transceiver snatched up right in front of us -- it wasn't much of a surprise when the remaining guys cut lose. We tore up the trees with rifle fire. {&1310}\par A lesser outfit might have completely lost it.{&1310}\par We were on the move constantly after that. Eventually, men stopped caring about noise and giving away their positions as they rushed headlong through the dead wood. Second squad disintegrated into wild fireteams that got lost assaulting shadows after those things got the lieutenant. And Sergeant Winters didn't last long with first squad once the clicking started. Third squad learned to run at that sound quickly enough. It didn't take a dozen men getting slaughtered without a damn thing they could do about it to teach us that.{&1310}\par After that, we ran -- what was left of third squad. And we'd been on the run ever since. I could understand Pratt. If there was a Hell, this certainly seemed like the right place to me.{&1310}\par Two days.{&1310}\par Maybe.{&1310}\par But it was hard to tell there in that dark.{&1310}\par Liam stirred to one side of me, the sound of the other man shifting so abrupt that the breath caught in my throat. He flexed cold, rigid hands on the stock of his rifle. He slept with it on top of him. Most of us did.{&1310}\par "How long?" he whispered as quietly as he could, voice scratching and groggy from too little sleep. It came out as more of a parched croak.{&1310}\par "Twenty, twenty five minutes," I murmured back. I squinted down at my timepiece out of habit, but the numbers still hadn't moved so I could never be sure. Mine had stopped working, along with my comm, after one of the first rounds of attacks. So had everyone else's, and we were left blind and fumbling along. I'd taken to counting seconds to pass time and keep awake. And to keep sane.{&1310}\par "You've got another five," I offered the other man, for whatever it was worth. Liam didn't say anything. He just lay there completely still with his eyes open like a corpse.{&1310}\par I wondered how much farther it was to the extraction point. Whatever the importance of that mission to whoever authorized it from on high, it had ended in failure as far as what was left of second platoon was concerned. It fell apart in the kind of ambush in an alien environment that I could only have nightmares about. If I survived. If any of us survived.{&1310}\par All that was left now was to get the hell out of there.{&1310}\par Five minutes later, and I was putting a careful hand on Dieter to wake him up when the guy nearly took my hand off with a knife. I reeled back out of reach and started to spit something angry back down at the other man when he just as abruptly froze.{&1310}\par "Did you hear that?"{&1310}\par I stopped too.{&1310}\par "What was it?"{&1310}\par "I can hear them," Dieter hissed after a second, squinting his eyes hard into slits. He tapped a finger to the side of his skull.{&1310}\par "Inside my head!"{&1310}\par We got the rest of them up in cascading fashion with each man waking another until all were moving again.  Half an hour of sleep every couple hours for days now. Ration bars and the abundance of water every man always carried in his rucksack. That wasn't the problem. It was the fact that we had to stop at all.{&1310}\par People vanished when we did.{&1310}\par "Rivera," was all Shawn said when I found him crouching in the dirt where the missing man had been. That brought us down to six now. From a full complement of over forty men. And I could only imagine what had become of the rest of the battalion on that failed op.{&1310}\par We found water later that day. A stagnant-looking river of black that cut into our path. Nothing drinkable, of course. This whole place had been infected somehow. This was \i not\i0  how colonies -- even the remote ones -- were supposed to look when the engineers were done their work. It made me wonder what the rest of their work had really been out here. That kind of thinking had been above my pay grade a couple of days and a lot of battalion lives ago. Maybe it still would be if I ever got out of here alive.{&1310}\par Forbidding and rancid as it was, that river was still a welcome landmark in our blind retreat through Hell. I had gotten enough of a look at the tactical maps before drop-off to know we could follow it right to the extraction point -- assuming it was the right one and we really hadn't stepped into somewhere else altogether through all this mess and death. The probably vain hope still managed put an urgency in everyone's step.{&1310}\par We lost Dieter a couple hours later, and decided not to sleep at all after that until we were clear. After I woke up that last time, I thought I knew just what the man had meant about them being inside his head.\cf2\f1 {&1310}\par }{&1310}
