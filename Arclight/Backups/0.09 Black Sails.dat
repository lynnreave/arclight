Hands were on me -- I threw them off. That thing was down my throat and I was choking on it. I grabbed onto that someone who was trying to hold me down and shoved them away. Only after he tumbled over backwards into the deck did I realize it was just Miller. He looked up at me with a dazed expression on his face.{&1310}\par That thing in my throat was the breathing tube. I was gagging on it, the disgusting feel of that blackness so abruptly violating me all I could think about and making me choke. I reached up and ripped it out, throwing up water and some stomach bile on myself while I did.{&1310}\par I was slumped over in my tank, drained and leaving me soaked in proto-amniotic fluid. The other trainees had been reactivating around me, climbing out of their tubes. A few glanced my way after I threw out Mills. He picked himself up from the floor, giving me a wary look.{&1310}\par "You okay, Weir?"{&1310}\par I tried to get my breathing under control, but I was still coughing up stuff from my stomach and lungs. It was just a dream. Just a dream. I forced that thought back down my throat as hard and fast as I could too. Just another \i stupid\i0  dream -- like all the others. I remembered now, things coming back in a jumbled rush. I'd managed to get in and go to sleep. Then I'd started dreaming back to getting on the ship with that morbid little bit of carnage thrown in just for fun. {&1310}\par These \i fucking\i0  tubes! {&1310}\par But it hadn't felt the same. I wasn't there as somebody else like living through a memory or riding around on the inside of their head. This time it was me and \i just\i0  me and that place was on a ship like this one and I didn't think I--{&1310}\par "Hey! Can you even hear me? Snap out of it, Weir!" {&1310}\par Miller was back in my face. I didn't think he meant to choke me this time, but I didn't get the chance to find out because that lieutenant who'd been chaperoning us from before came running into the room behind with a live rifle clutched in her hands. I remembered standing here and getting into the tube and, at the same time, falling in the dark before I ever could. I felt like I'd fallen out of time just looking at everyone suddenly displaced along with me. Except, they acted like nothing else had happened.{&1310}\par Why did it always feel so fucking real?{&1310}\par "Move it! Move it!" Cizeki cried at us, still in her own G-suit and dripping translucent tank sludge all over the deck. It was pretty obvious she had just hopped out and grabbed a weapon. Her blond hair was dark and clinging to her lined face. "Get out of those tanks and line up, trainees!"{&1310}\par "What the hell ..." Mills muttered as his head whipped back around. For the first time, I realized that there were yellow warning lights flashing along the seams of the bulkheads and dull-pitched klaxons droning in the air. The ship was under attack.{&1310}\par "Pirates?" someone else blurted out before they could even get in formation, frozen and looking around in awe after coming to the same conclusion as me. The lieutenant just shook her head.{&1310}\par "That's not what you need to worry about right now, recruit. Fall in!"{&1310}\par He did. But not without barking out some more.{&1310}\par "What if there's a boarding party? We need to get to the armory! Uh, ma'am!"{&1310}\par He had that nervous excitement in his popping eyes beneath a shaved head, eyeballing the officer's rifle eagerly. Some of the others were coming alive too. Tank-sleep got subdued by pre-battle anticipation. Because that was what they thought was happening. Months and months of training for just this sort of thing and now it was sort of just happening all of a sudden on this inconsequential little gunboat transport for a dozen boots.{&1310}\par "Shut your mouths," the woman snapped at them -- at all of us -- with a warning finger, "and follow me."{&1310}\par Murmuring now. All that pro-military, fight-the-good-fight bullshit shoved down their throats this whole time abruptly vomited back up all at once. Not me -- I just felt like retching up something else entirely. I felt sick, that tank-dream still stuck in my head.{&1310}\par How did I know those bodies weren't theirs and I wasn't some freak prophet? It had happened before. Old Haakon was supposed to have only had the ability to See -- no other psychokinetic abilities. It was how they said he had beaten the Imperials, with their limitless fleets and death drones raining down from the skies on the scattered colonies. Maybe, but it was almost funny how much wishful thinking that was. Wouldn't it be easier to just accept that I had no talent at all? I guess so. But, if it was even possible -- well, too bad my dreams were only ever about death. That couldn't have been a good thing.{&1310}\par "Don't worry," Miller said as we jogged along after the lieutenant down the ship corridor. I realized he was talking to me. The rest of the frigate's crew were coming alive and bustling about, nearly running us over. He was looking back over his shoulder at me. Nervous, but he tried to hide it.{&1310}\par God, now \i really\i0  wasn't the time.{&1310}\par We didn't end up at the armory. Instead, Cizeki took us to the tiny mess and stuck us trainees in there while she disappeared to report to the bridge. Some of the others -- like that one guy who'd seemed so eager -- were disappointed. Pissed even. If the door hadn't been locked from the outside behind the officer, I'm pretty sure they would have done something stupid. Instead, we were just stuck.{&1310}\par Stuck in that tiny little tomb on a ship under attack. And for some reason I was the only one who seemed worried sick instead of just feeling cheated.{&1310}\par The good news was that the mess had a port looking out into space. The bad news was that there was only one and everyone was suddenly shoving their way over there to see.{&1310}\par "Where are they?"{&1310}\par "I can't see anything."{&1310}\par "Goddamnit, let me in!"{&1310}\par A couple future grunts started fighting over the prime spots, but that got broken up quick when someone stabbed an overextended finger over their heads into the glass.{&1310}\par "Look!"{&1310}\par "Is that it?"{&1310}\par "I can't fucking tell!"{&1310}\par I couldn't see either and I wasn't sure I wanted too. I stood back from that mass of excited trainees just watching them, still feeling slightly nauseous. Miller looked like he wanted to join them too, but stayed back like me. Probably thought Psychos were better than all that useless jockeying. Maybe they were, who knew. But they should have been scared. There were some pretty damn good reasons to be.{&1310}\par I had read about this sort of thing -- we all had, during training. The pirates liked to leave improvised anti-high velocity travel devices like snares along known traffic routes between populated parts of the sector. Out here in the dark they'd catch ships helpless and get them. Not for the money, valuables, or cargo, though. Never that. Shenlizite -- that was all they ever took. The stuff they put in everything to make it work. Most ships and the crew onboard died pretty quickly once they ripped it out of the engines' fuel cells and left them adrift and helpless in the dead of space.{&1310}\par "No insignia," someone noted.{&1310}\par "What?"{&1310}\par "They've got no insignia -- it's gotta be pirates. Only they fly without colors out here."{&1310}\par "Who cares? It's all Tau bullshit anyways."{&1310}\par "Yeah, everyone knows they're funding the pieces of shit -- might as well be flying their banner for all it matters."{&1310}\par "Don't we all know it."{&1310}\par I didn't need to see the other ship to have a good idea what was coming our way. Maybe they hailed the captain and asked for him to surrender. Maybe they didn't. They probably didn't. All I had to wait for was the telltale rock of railgun fire. I knew what it felt like from the simulations but somehow the real thing was still always ten times worse.{&1310}\par It was the fear.{&1310}\par The lights dimmed and the bulkheads came alive with the pervasive hum of power being redirected to ablative armor plating and weapons. We'd come in a gunship, so at least we could fight back. But that sickening wrench in my stomach from when I'd woken back up in the tank began to twist into a creeping sense of terror instead. Whatever happened -- we were helpless down here. I could see our deaths inside my head. Pitiful, hopless, and wasted. That wasn't what we'd signed up for, but they never told you that in the recruitment vids.{&1310}\par "Here we go," someone said from inside that crowd of trainees squashed up against the port view. It had a reverential tone to it, like what someone might say right before doing something profoundly unique for the first time. We could have been about to make a high-orbital jump, or have a first kiss. The quiet that settled over them all made the whole thing feel almost spiritual in nature.{&1310}\par I suddenly couldn't breathe. Then Miller was muttering something under his breath.{&1310}\par "\i Screw \i0 this."{&1310}\par He gave me a weird look right before spinning back around, anxious frustration twisting his face. He went at the door and pounded a fist against it. {&1310}\par "What are you doing?" I managed to squeak at him, gagging on the feel of no air in my throat.{&1310}\par "It's locked, buddy," one of the crowd peeled his eyes away from the spectacle outside just long enough to chide Mills. Another guy followed him. And that one watched him ease up and flex his hand so that his palm was flat against the metal. His face smoothed out with it and he took a deep, calming breath.{&1310}\par "Fuck, man," that one elbowed the other in the arm, "he's a Psycho. You know what they can do?"{&1310}\par "Psycho-in-training," the first shook his head, but abandoned the port to keep watching Mills. His friend did too.{&1310}\par Miller had a hand reached out to the console now too and closed his eyes. I think he was trying to unlock it. From the outside or inside -- I don't know. I never saw any of the other cadets manage anything more than moving simple objects around during training. The hard stuff would've come later. But that never stopped some of them from experimenting on their own late at night in the safety of their bunkrooms. Maybe ...{&1310}\par "You can do it, Mills," I told him, as encouragingly as I could. But that tank-dream was still clogging up the insides of my head.{&1310}\par "Shut up," he snapped, then completely reversed himself. "I mean -- sorry. I just ... I need to concentrate."{&1310}\par Cannon fire sounded above us, shaking the whole ship. People gasped, and I thought we'd been hit. Maybe it didn't even matter if we got out of that room -- if we were still going to be blown apart out in the middle of space. The ship shifted more and it happened again. But ... not a hit -- us \i firing\i0 . There was a cry of excitement and someone pounded the port window.{&1310}\par "They're not even fighting back! They're running!"{&1310}\par Those two guys watching Mills with me whipped back around, looking pissed.{&1310}\par "Damn it, we missed it!"{&1310}\par Some other guy flicked the pirate ship off through the port. "Suck on that, fucking assholes!"{&1310}\par "Look, they're ... they're turning back ... god, they're running away!"{&1310}\par "Yeeeeah! Betcha didn't think it'd be a warship coming out at ya!"{&1310}\par "Fuuuck, yes."{&1310}\par And just like that ... it was over. No incoming fire. No boarding party. No real fighting.{&1310}\par Nothing.{&1310}\par Later on, Lieutenant Cizeki would inform us that they had hit a snare while in HV travel -- just like I figured. The systems reactivated all hands before it even dropped back to normal speeds and the captain opened fire before the enemy ship made any attempt to communicate or attack. If they had been pirates -- and they probably had been -- they weren't counting on an armed military vessel and almost immediately retreated. She was pretty quick with assuring us that the other ship was no match for the \i Noybaerleen \i0 in a stand-up fight. They had been trained and prepared for just this sort of thing and so would we one day if we kept at it. Remember that at finals, and keep up the hard work. The Grand Admirals are watching, etcetera. Dismissed, trainees.{&1310}\par But ... what she didn't think about -- or any of the other trainees for that matter -- was how easily this could have been an unarmed transport we were on. How just as easily as we had turned them back, we could have been boarded, raided, and left to rot. Not even a year ago, that's what would have happened. I could see it in my head like it had. The pirates hadn't been so bold with the main routes back then. No one would have thought they needed to divert an entire gunship just to ferry around some new recruits. And we all would have been dead.{&1310}\par It was why we were so lucky, but I didn't feel so good about it like all the other trainees. Neither did Mills, I could tell. We were the only two not smiling and bragging and chattering excitedly away about it the whole rest of the way to Riftwatch station.{&1310}\par He never had managed to get that door open and there was all the reason in the world to believe we would have died down there otherwise. Locked in and helpless. It wasn't the kind of thing anyone else wanted to think about when they thought about this guerilla war with the pirates.{&1310}\par \pard\fi720\sl0\slmult1 Dying alone and helpless in the middle of nowhere.\cf2\f1 {&1310}\par }{&1310}

It was just a dream. Just a dream. I forced that thought back down my throat as hard and fast as I could too. Just another \i stupid\i0  dream -- like all the others. I remembered now, things coming back in a jumbled rush. I'd managed to get in and go to sleep. Then I'd started dreaming back to getting on the ship with that morbid little bit of carnage thrown in just for fun. {&1310}\par These \i fucking\i0  tubes! {&1310}\par But it hadn't felt the same. I wasn't there as somebody else like living through a memory or riding around on the inside of their head. This time it was me and \i just\i0  me and that place was on a ship like this one and I didn't think I--{&1310}\par "Hey! Can you even hear me? Snap out of it, Weir!" {&1310}\par Miller was back in my face. I didn't think he meant to choke me this time, but I didn't get the chance to find out because that lieutenant who'd been chaperoning us from before came running into the room behind with a live rifle clutched in her hands. I remembered standing here and getting into the tube and, at the same time, falling in the dark before I ever could. I felt like I'd fallen out of time just looking at everyone suddenly displaced along with me. Except, they acted like nothing else had happened.{&1310}\par Why did it always feel so fucking real?{&1310}\par "Move it! Move it!" Cizeki cried at us, still in her own G-suit and dripping translucent tank sludge all over the deck. It was pretty obvious she had just hopped out and grabbed a weapon. Her blond hair was dark and clinging to her lined face. "Get out of those tanks and line up, trainees!"{&1310}\par "What the hell ..." Mills muttered as his head whipped back around. For the first time, I realized that there were yellow warning lights flashing along the seams of the bulkheads and dull-pitched klaxons droning in the air. The ship was under attack.{&1310}\par "Pirates?" someone else blurted out before they could even get in formation, frozen and looking around in awe after coming to the same conclusion as me. The lieutenant just shook her head.{&1310}\par "That's not what you need to worry about right now, recruit. Fall in!"{&1310}\par He did. But not without barking out some more.{&1310}\par "What if there's a boarding party? We need to get to the armory! Uh, ma'am!"{&1310}\par He had that nervous excitement in his popping eyes beneath a shaved head, eyeballing the officer's rifle eagerly. Some of the others were coming alive too. Tank-sleep got subdued by pre-battle anticipation. Because that was what they thought was happening. Months and months of training for just this sort of thing and now it was sort of just happening all of a sudden on this inconsequential little gunboat transport for a dozen boots.{&1310}\par "Shut your mouths," the woman snapped at them -- at all of us -- with a warning finger, "and follow me."{&1310}\par Murmuring now. All that pro-military, fight-the-good-fight bullshit shoved down their throats this whole time abruptly vomited back up all at once. Not me -- I just felt like retching up something else entirely. I felt sick, that tank-dream still stuck in my head.{&1310}\par How did I know those bodies weren't theirs and I wasn't some freak prophet? It had happened before. Old Haakon was supposed to have only had the ability to See -- no other psychokinetic abilities. It was how they said he had beaten the Imperials, with their limitless fleets and death drones raining down from the skies on the scattered colonies. Maybe, but it was almost funny how much wishful thinking that was. Wouldn't it be easier to just accept that I had no talent at all? I guess so. But, if it was even possible -- well, too bad my dreams were only ever about death. That couldn't have been a good thing.{&1310}\par "Don't worry," Miller said as we jogged along after the lieutenant down the ship corridor. I realized he was talking to me. The rest of the frigate's crew were coming alive and bustling about, nearly running us over. He was looking back over his shoulder at me. Nervous, but he tried to hide it.{&1310}\par God, now \i really\i0  wasn't the time.{&1310}\par We didn't end up at the armory. Instead, Cizeki took us to the tiny mess and stuck us trainees in there while she disappeared to report to the bridge. Some of the others -- like that one guy who'd seemed so eager -- were disappointed. Pissed even. If the door hadn't been locked from the outside behind the officer, I'm pretty sure they would have done something stupid. Instead, we were just stuck.{&1310}\par Stuck in that tiny little tomb on a ship under attack. And for some reason I was the only one who seemed worried sick instead of just feeling cheated.{&1310}\par The good news was that the mess had a port looking out into space. The bad news was that there was only one and everyone was suddenly shoving their way over there to see.{&1310}\par "Where are they?"{&1310}\par "I can't see anything."{&1310}\par "Goddamnit, let me in!"{&1310}\par A couple future grunts started fighting over the prime spots, but that got broken up quick when someone stabbed an overextended finger over their heads into the glass.{&1310}\par "Look!"{&1310}\par "Is that it?"{&1310}\par "I can't fucking tell!"{&1310}\par I couldn't see either and I wasn't sure I wanted too. I stood back from that mass of excited trainees just watching them, still feeling slightly nauseous. Miller looked like he wanted to join them too, but stayed back like me. Probably thought Psychos were better than all that useless jockeying. Maybe they were, who knew. But they should have been scared. There were some pretty damn good reasons to be.{&1310}\par I had read about this sort of thing -- we all had, during training. The pirates liked to leave improvised anti-high velocity travel devices like snares along known traffic routes between populated parts of the sector. Out here in the dark they'd catch ships helpless and get them. Not for the money, valuables, or cargo, though. Never that. Shenlizite -- that was all they ever took. The stuff they put in everything to make it work. Most ships and the crew onboard died pretty quickly once they ripped it out of the engines' fuel cells and left them adrift and helpless in the dead of space.{&1310}\par "No insignia," someone noted.{&1310}\par "What?"{&1310}\par "They've got no insignia -- it's gotta be pirates. Only they fly without colors out here."{&1310}\par "Who cares? It's all Tau bullshit anyways."{&1310}\par "Yeah, everyone knows they're funding the pieces of shit -- might as well be flying their banner for all it matters."{&1310}\par "Don't we all know it."{&1310}\par I didn't need to see the other ship to have a good idea what was coming our way. Maybe they hailed the captain and asked for him to surrender. Maybe they didn't. They probably didn't. All I had to wait for was the telltale rock of railgun fire. I knew what it felt like from the simulations but somehow the real thing was still always ten times worse.{&1310}\par It was the fear.{&1310}\par The lights dimmed and the bulkheads came alive with the pervasive hum of power being redirected to ablative armor plating and weapons. We'd come in a gunship, so at least we could fight back. But that sickening wrench in my stomach from when I'd woken back up in the tank began to twist into a creeping sense of terror instead. Whatever happened -- we were helpless down here. I could see our deaths inside my head. Pitiful, hopless, and wasted. That wasn't what we'd signed up for, but they never told you that in the recruitment vids.{&1310}\par "Here we go," someone said from inside that crowd of trainees squashed up against the port view. It had a reverential tone to it, like what someone might say right before doing something profoundly unique for the first time. We could have been about to make a high-orbital jump, or have a first kiss. The quiet that settled over them all made the whole thing feel almost spiritual in nature.{&1310}\par I suddenly couldn't breathe. Then Miller was muttering something under his breath.{&1310}\par "\i Screw \i0 this."{&1310}\par He gave me a weird look right before spinning back around, anxious frustration twisting his face. He went at the door and pounded a fist against it. {&1310}\par "What are you doing?" I managed to squeak at him, gagging on the feel of no air in my throat.{&1310}\par "It's locked, buddy," one of the crowd peeled his eyes away from the spectacle outside just long enough to chide Mills. Another guy followed him. And that one watched him ease up and flex his hand so that his palm was flat against the metal. His face smoothed out with it and he took a deep, calming breath.{&1310}\par "Fuck, man," that one elbowed the other in the arm, "he's a Psycho. You know what they can do?"{&1310}\par "Psycho-in-training," the first shook his head, but abandoned the port to keep watching Mills. His friend did too.{&1310}\par Miller had a hand reached out to the console now too and closed his eyes. I think he was trying to unlock it. From the outside or inside -- I don't know. I never saw any of the other cadets manage anything more than moving simple objects around during training. The hard stuff would've come later. But that never stopped some of them from experimenting on their own late at night in the safety of their bunkrooms. Maybe ...{&1310}\par "You can do it, Mills," I told him, as encouragingly as I could. But that tank-dream was still clogging up the insides of my head.{&1310}\par "Shut up," he snapped, then completely reversed himself. "I mean -- sorry. I just ... I need to concentrate."{&1310}\par Cannon fire sounded above us, shaking the whole ship. People gasped, and I thought we'd been hit. Maybe it didn't even matter if we got out of that room -- if we were still going to be blown apart out in the middle of space. The ship shifted more and it happened again. But ... not a hit -- us \i firing\i0 . There was a cry of excitement and someone pounded the port window.{&1310}\par "They're not even fighting back! They're running!"{&1310}\par Those two guys watching Mills with me whipped back around, looking pissed.{&1310}\par "Damn it, we missed it!"{&1310}\par Some other guy flicked the pirate ship off through the port. "Suck on that, fucking assholes!"{&1310}\par "Look, they're ... they're turning back ... god, they're running away!"{&1310}\par "Yeeeeah! Betcha didn't think it'd be a warship coming out at ya!"{&1310}\par "Fuuuck, yes."{&1310}\par And just like that ... it was over. No incoming fire. No boarding party. No real fighting.{&1310}\par Nothing.{&1310}\par Later on, Lieutenant Cizeki would inform us that they had hit a snare while in HV travel -- just like I figured. The systems reactivated all hands before it even dropped back to normal speeds and the captain opened fire before the enemy ship made any attempt to communicate or attack. If they had been pirates -- and they probably had been -- they weren't counting on an armed military vessel and almost immediately retreated. She was pretty quick with assuring us that the other ship was no match for the \i Noybaerleen \i0 in a stand-up fight. They had been trained and prepared for just this sort of thing and so would we one day if we kept at it. Remember that at finals, and keep up the hard work. The Grand Admirals are watching, etcetera. Dismissed, trainees.{&1310}\par But ... what she didn't think about -- or any of the other trainees for that matter -- was how easily this could have been an unarmed transport we were on. How just as easily as we had turned them back, we could have been boarded, raided, and left to rot. Not even a year ago, that's what would have happened. I could see it in my head like it had. The pirates hadn't been so bold with the main routes back then. No one would have thought they needed to divert an entire gunship just to ferry around some new recruits. And we all would have been dead.{&1310}\par It was why we were so lucky, but I didn't feel so good about it like all the other trainees. Neither did Mills, I could tell. We were the only two not smiling and bragging and chattering excitedly away about it the whole rest of the way to Riftwatch station.{&1310}\par He never had managed to get that door open and there was all the reason in the world to believe we would have died down there otherwise.

Hands were on me -- I threw them off. That thing was down my throat and I was choking on it. I grabbed onto that someone who was trying to hold me down and shoved them away. Only after he tumbled over backwards into the deck did I realize it was just Miller. He looked up at me with a dazed expression on his face.{&1310}\par That thing in my throat was the breathing tube.
