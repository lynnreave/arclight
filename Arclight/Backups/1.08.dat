I jolted back awake at the touch.{&1310}\par Fingers on my arm. I snatched back my hand, and twisted that way with a gasp. A little kid hunched down beside me, his face a sickly yellow. He stank, and was mumbling something in a squeaking voice that made my skin crawl. He looked like he had just clawed its way out of the garbage.{&1310}\par I must have been loud, because I felt dad beside me in an instant. He just stood there, but that little boy whipped back around and scampered off without another thought. I glanced up at him, and he down at me. Then he turned back away, face as hard as ever.{&1310}\par "If you want to see Riftwatch before we leave for good," he told me, now over near a porthole in the wall behind, "then you had better come do so now."{&1310}\par I twisted around in surprise, but I wasn't in the access tunnels anymore. It was a big cabin, simple benches and chairs scattered all around. People were everywhere. A few looked like the child I woke up to. Most were quiet. But it was loud in there all the same, and I didn't recognize any of them.{&1310}\par I couldn't remember what happened after the flames in the tunnels. I tried. I guess I had found dad, though, so it didn't matter that much. I had made it. I just had no idea where I had made it to.{&1310}\par "Evelyn."{&1310}\par I pushed myself up at the sound of his voice, harsher this time. He glanced back from the porthole - none of the ones on Riftwatch I had seen were ever that crude and dirty. Except maybe down where nobody really went. I don't know. But dad was waiting there for me.{&1310}\par My body was a little stiff, but that was all. I remembered the two men in the tunnels tossing me around with the Voidtongue. I guess I passed out sometime in the middle of it, and he found me. Somehow. It left me wondering what dad must have done to those two as I hobbled over toward the window. When I got there, he pulled back so I could see.{&1310}\par "There," he pointed. But I didn't need him too. There was only one thing to look at other than the Rift, glimmering and flourescent in the depths of space. The station - Riftwatch ... Home. It was small enough now to fit in that dingy little porthole.{&1310}\par We had left.{&1310}\par We had already left.{&1310}\par No more Warden. No more Watchmen or Elle. No more Bertram or Ressler or even Sergeant Macome.{&1310}\par No more Tess ...{&1310}\par Somehow, I was sitting again. I didn't get to see Riftwatch fade away out of sight. I'm not sure if I cared about that. I had thought there would be goodbyes and a last moment before getting on that shuttle. But, nothing. We were just suddenly here.{&1310}\par Except here wasn't on a shuttle. I looked around again, and that much was obvious. A different ship. Bigger, probably. I glanced back toward dad.{&1310}\par "What happened?" I finally asked.{&1310}\par He didn't take his eyes away from the porthole, staring out into space. And, when he eventually did answer me, I couldn't help but wonder if it was even worth the trouble of me opening my mouth.{&1310}\par "Events that I had not foreseen."{&1310}\par "What?"{&1310}\par Maybe it was my fault. If I wasn't smart enough to figure it out, then he wasn't going to tell me. That was usually the way things went. Just because we weren't in Riftwatch anymore didn't mean everything was going to change.{&1310}\par So I tried something different.{&1310}\par "Where are we?"{&1310}\par The answer this time, was a bit more forthcoming. But not by much.{&1310}\par "On our way to someplace safer."{&1310}\par I eyed the crowd in there again. It \i was \i0 a ship of some sort. Below the main decks, I would guess. Not much safer than Riftwatch, though. I don't know if he really noticed. But that was when \i I\i0  noticed something. A missing something. Precisely, \i three\i0  missing somethings.{&1310}\par My bags! They were gone!{&1310}\par I tore all around me in a frenzy. There was \i noooo\i0  way I had just lost them like that after all the running around on the station. Not after everything I'd been through today. I found the backpack I had been wearing - propped up like a bad pillow on the bench I woke up on - and snagged that lifeline. Dad noticed my frantic searching with a calm eye from where he stood. My eyes flashed up at him in an instant.{&1310}\par "Where are my things?"{&1310}\par "I left the rest behind," he explained, as cool as could be. He wasn't talking about his own stuff being thrown away back on the station. Not that it mattered.{&1310}\par "W\i hat\i0 ?"{&1310}\par "It was too much, Evelyn," he continued in that infuriatingly placid tone. "We have to move quickly." Maybe I was still just a little in shock.{&1310}\par All my things ... \i Gone\i0  ...{&1310}\par And he acted like it was the least important thing in the universe just then. I ... I think I was going to scream at him.{&1310}\par I almost did. I stood up and opened my mouth to. Right there in the middle of that floating refugee camp full of people I didn't know. That was when he rounded on me abruptly, though. The look on his face was so suddenly deadpan that I choked on the sound in my throat instantly.{&1310}\par "What?" I ventured anxiously when he said nothing, just stared back into the room. I twisted my head around to get a good look, but there was nothing more interesting going on there. I was still left wondering why we were down there looking like dirty refugees instead of up on what must have been one of the much nicer decks. Dad was pretty important back on Riftwatch.{&1310}\par He just laid a hand down on my shoulder, though.
