Slow. And then fast. I stared down at my feet - looked up, and an hour had passed. Landmarks had already faded behind. Then seconds would crawl by so slowly that I thought they'd choke the life out of me. The air felt thick, and heavy, and never stopped moving. It made it hard to breath.{&1310}\par "Are you okay, Ev?" Tess tugged at my elbow somewhere along the bleak way of rocky hills sprouting up and leaving those less bumpy flatlands behind.{&1310}\par I jerked at the touch without realizing it, forgetting she was even there and real for a while. Then I abruptly wondered why she was.{&1310}\par "I kind of ... followed you," she told me later, trudging beside that stony bluff Julian had said the train tunnel ran right through. So strange.{&1310}\par "I hid in one of the storage closets for two days. Just don't ask me how I got to the toilet. You know Old Weir-do never sleeps."{&1310}\par He does now, I thought suddenly then. Tess laughed it off, but I could tell her heart just wasn't in it. I almost wished that I could laugh. But the thought of it still cut too deep.{&1310}\par I asked about the tattooed man when she told me about crashing on the moon, and she said he was Eluvian. I hadn't seen it, though I supposed he had the profile and features. Tall, and well-proportioned. Handsome, in a timeless sort of way if you squinted through the harshness and grime. Tess had always been more into that stuff than me. But I had always thought the Eluvians were supposed to be very peaceful. Not carrying around guns and fighting monsters on some moon in the middle of nowhere.{&1310}\par "I know, right?" Tess shook her head at me. "I think he was hunting pirates. Or something."{&1310}\par It was hard for her to bury all that excitement in misery. She had wanted to get off Riftwatch even more than I had. It was probably why she had snuck along in the first place. Too bad things had turned out worse than either of us could have ever imagined back in Riftwatch. I think Dad had tried to tell me that.{&1310}\par "Why is he here then?"{&1310}\par Stuck there on that moon running for their lives seemed like the last place anyone else should have been. He didn't know us.{&1310}\par Apparently Tess had put up a distress beacon as soon as she found me, though, and that had lured him in.{&1310}\par "I don't think he really wanted to help us," she whispered to me behind his back as he set a breakneck marching pace ahead.{&1310}\par "Then why is he?"{&1310}\par She just shrugged.{&1310}\par "If I were him, I'd have left us behind a long time ago."{&1310}\par She didn't really explain that, or why he might be so eager to abandon us - comlete and total strangers or otherwise. But I had seen Tess provoke him back at the station. I knew her well enough to suppose at what she might have done to piss him off. Still, I had seen him nearly get himself killed putting hismelf between us and that thing back on the train too.{&1310}\par "Do you know what that ... it was?" Tess asked, reading my mind. Or maybe she just saw the white in my face at the memory. Either way, I shook my head.{&1310}\par "I saw something like it," I managed. And swallowed down the bile in my throat. "Back on the transport ship."{&1310}\par We slowed enough at one point for her to catch up and ask Julian what it was as well, but his answer was even less helpful.{&1310}\par "No," he grunted at her, keeping his rifle low and to the dirt as he moved. "But it didn't belong here."{&1310}\par "What the hell's that supposed to mean?"{&1310}\par He didn't answer her for a time, preoccupied with everything else around him. I listened in just the same when he did.{&1310}\par "I could feel it," he continued in a low, absent voice. "Like a nail scratching on steel." And then he just repeated himself. "It didn't belong here."{&1310}\par And that was as much as she got out of him. It reminded me a little of how Dad had sounded before we ran off into that man and he -{&1310}\par I don't know how long we walked. Everything dimmed as that planet in the sky dipped down toward the horizon. I saw stars in empty space, but the formations weren't familiar anymore. The air was thick, moist, and made my tongue taste like twigs and weeds. It made me dizzy sometimes. Tess, too, I could tell. But Julian kept on hard.{&1310}\par {&1310}\par I was tired, and breathless, when he finally stopped again. Not that it mattered. Wherever we were going - we were finally there.{&1310}\par The tunnel must have ended, because tracks came shooting out of the ground beside us and through a gate off into the distance.{&1310}\par "Is that the space port?"{&1310}\par It was Tess who asked. Flagging and hunched over, with her arms flopping listlessly at her sides, she managed to throw one that way and cough a few words out. Julian just shook his head.{&1310}\par "No."{&1310}\par "So - " Tess huffed back at him, twisting her head around forlornly. "What the hell ... What's it then?"{&1310}\par It was a step up from the washed-out town we left behind. A lot of long, squat, and port-less buildings with large doors. Too large for people. Further on there were some different kinds clustered at the middle of it all, looking packed-in but much more live-able. A huge toward stretched up from the middle of them into the sky there. I lost the top of it in the clouds.{&1310}\par "That will go to the port," Julian said, canting his head toward the tower.{&1310}\par It was more for himself than us, though. Some reassurance. Because he started down toward that place without another word. Tess just groaned, and stumbled after.\cf2\f2 {&1310}\par }{&1310}
