And they started wrestling over that gun in his hand.{&1310}\par He won out pretty quickly.{&1310}\par "Don't you ... don't you \i fucking \i0 dare!"

"You do realize that, don't you?" The pistol sang as he prep'ed the round in the chamber. Lieutenant Boyce had taught me you didn't really need to do that if it'd already been loaded.

Julian snapped at her like a parent scolding an unruly child.{&1310}\par She didn't answer him. Just kept struggling. Until her wild eyes found me.{&1310}\par "Ev!" she cried out desperately, clawing at the Eluvian's jacket with her fingers. "Don't let him do it!"{&1310}\par It might have been funny to watch her flail about like that, kicking out to reach him and looking like a helpless kid in that hold. Julian didn't laugh, but I did. I couldn't help it. But there was no humor in the sound, and it died instantly with the sharp, aghast look Tess threw back at me.{&1310}\par "He'll have the rest of his friends hunting us all over the planet once they realize what happened back there!"

"We didn't do anything wrong."{&1310}\par I didn't agree.{&1310}\par "It won't matter," Julian seethed at her, getting in close. "They'll make sure everyone thinks you did.

But that didn't stop him from looking back at Richter to shoot.{&1310}\par One of Tess' hands slipped into her coat and she swiped at Julian the second he wasn't looking. The sleeve of his coat ripped open and he shoved her away into the far bulkhead reflexivly. Blood welled up beneath the leather, and Julian stared at the pink-haired woman.{&1310}\par There was a knife on the deck. Tess twisted over and snatched it up before rounding back on the Eluvian, looking wild and furious. It was an unnervingly big shard of steel, like the kind you saw soldiers wear. I wondered where the hell she had gotten it from before Julian opened his mouth.{&1310}\par "You stole that from me," he said as she climbed warily back to his feet, eyes fixed on the man like a cornered beast the whole time. It was as accusatory as it was astonished. Then his demeanor turned dark. "Give it back." He held out a hand.{&1310}\par "Let him go."{&1310}\par He started to say something, but glanced back at the console Richter had collapsed on before pushing a few buttons. Then he looked at us.{&1310}\par The pistol went off.{&1310}\par Tess leapt at him with a shriek of fury, and I was pretty sure she'd slice him open with that knife even though I'd never seen her really hurt someone before in her life. Those cheery green eyes had melted into mad fury. But Julian was ready for her charge. He disarmed and tossed her back down into the deck all in one smooth motion.{&1310}\par I stared at the man, feeling a little shock bleed through. Enough to freeze me in place while Tess struggled to pull herself back up from the ground. He didn't bother to look at me, but I flinched anyways as he pulled that gun away from the other man's head.{&1310}\par And I flinched again when he pointed it at me.{&1310}\par I threw my hands across my face and ducked aside just as the console behnid me blew up. Just in time to realize that he could have killed me had he meant to. The shot was wide, and he wouldn't have missed. As soon as he was done with Richter, Julian started shooting out all the consoles. The room had lit up with a bright flash of exploding electronics and fiery sparks.

"You do realize that, don't you?" The pistol sang as he prep'ed the round in the chamber. Lieutenant Boyce had taught me you didn't really need to do that if it'd already been loaded.

I wondered where the hell she had gotten it from before Julian opened his mouth.{&1310}\par "You stole that from me," he said as she climbed warily back to his feet, eyes fixed on the man like a cornered beast the whole time. It was as accusatory as it was astonished. Then his demeanor turned dark. "Give it back." He held out a hand.{&1310}\par "Let him go."{&1310}\par He started to say something, but glanced back at the console Richter had collapsed on before pushing a few buttons. Then he looked at us.{&1310}\par The pistol went off.{&1310}\par Tess leapt at him with a shriek of fury, and I was pretty sure she'd slice him open with that knife even though I'd never seen her really hurt someone before in her life. Those cheery green eyes had melted into mad fury. But Julian was ready for her charge. He disarmed and tossed her back down into the ground all in one smooth motion.{&1310}\par When he was done with Richter, he started shooting out all the consoles until the room had lit up with a bright flash of exploding electronics and fiery sparks.

Enough to freeze me in place while Tess struggled to pull herself back up from the ground. He didn't bother to look at me, but I flinched anyways as he pulled that gun away from the other man's head.{&1310}\par And I flinched again when he pointed it at me.{&1310}\par I threw my hands across my face and ducked aside just as the console behnid me blew up. Just in time to realize that he could have killed me had he meant to. The shot was wide, and he wouldn't have missed.
