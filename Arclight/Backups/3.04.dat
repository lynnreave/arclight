For you, I'd guess since there aren't any other off-world women running around here with hair and eyes that particular color."{&1310}\par "What are you talking about, Jules?"{&1310}\par Tess had still barely picked herself back up from losing it a minute ago, but that shakiness got buried in her sudden confusion at those leading questions. Leading me, that is. He was fishing for an answer in my eyes and I think he got it a couple seconds later when it suddenly dawned on me why someone might be looking for me.{&1310}\par I started shaking myself. As I watched, the hand I'd brought to my face was trembling. It was a bit surreal, being as numb just then from overload as I was. My body still felt the shock and surprise, but I couldn't interpret it mentally. I felt almost entirely detached from the whole thing like I was just watching someone else do it for me.{&1310}\par "Wh-why did they attack Tess, then?" I heard myself ask. But that wasn't the real question inside my head. It was why had they tried to take her head.{&1310}\par "You tell me," was all Julian said.{&1310}\par "I don't know."{&1310}\par I couldn't look at him anymore. Or Tess. Flashbacks to the cruiser in space, that man trying to take me from dad, and that black sword stabbed right through him instead. Someone had come for Tess, but they were looking for me. I'd seen her die right in front of me, and it had all been because of me. Again.{&1310}\par But she was alive now. Right?{&1310}\par I really didn't know what to think anymore.{&1310}\par "How did they find me?" my body was asking next. Julian was still studying me.{&1310}\par "My guess is that someone called in your friend here poking around government property and looking very foreign and out of place," he speculated. "I'd have to break the encryption on the rest of his communications to be sure, but I recognized a few simple datapoints. Numbers and money, I think."{&1310}\par "Money?"{&1310}\par Julian nodded at Tess, briefly.{&1310}\par "These weren't security agents, and I doubt they'd hire contract killers just to investigate a strange girl asking questions."{&1310}\par "So what then?" Tess prodded, looking irritated with all the drawn out conjecture.{&1310}\par "Bounty hunters, I think," was what he concluded. And he left it at that just for me.{&1310}\par I sat with that thought in my head for a while, trying to just think around it. It was hard. Everything since leaving home had started to look and feel like one long nightmare that I kept hopng I would just wake up from. Dad was dead. Tess was too ... sort of. And everything else just felt like it was slipping wildly away around me.{&1310}\par Again, it was Tess who broke the silence.{&1310}\par "You're kidding, right?" She practically laughed. "Bounty hunters? Like in the vids, seriously? I mean, why the hell would anyone want to pay anyone to find Ev?"{&1310}\par "Why are you asking me?" Julian snapped back at her. "I don't even know you two, or anything about you. This is \i your\i0  problem-"{&1310}\par Tess gasped right over him, not listening. She covered her mouth with her hands and looked at me with wide eyes.{&1310}\par "Wait. You don't think this has anything to do with those messages your dad got right before we left ... do you?"{&1310}\par "I just frowned at her.{&1310}\par "What?"{&1310}\par She clamped up, though, thinking.

I looked up to Julian standing there watching and listening to us. I think he was satisfied with my genuine lack of understanding about the whole situation, even if he still held fast to that suspicion in the back of his head. I looked up to him because he hadn't lost his mind in all this mess. Tess was an emotional wreck teaming just below a thin, easily distracted surface. Me, I was pretty sure I was just crazy. But Julian, whoever he was, was about the closest thing to sanity still maybe willing to help us get out of there.{&1310}\par I waited, and eventually he opened his mouth.{&1310}\par "We'll take our chances with the train tonight and see what we can manage," he told us.
