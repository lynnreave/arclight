At least, there wasn't anything there when Richter, Tess, and I all went in with guns drawn later. Even with a weapon that could melt the flesh right off of anything we found in there, I still made sure I kept that man in front of me.{&1310}\par I found myself thinking, "better him than me," and guilt crept in while he crept ahead toward the shower stall. But mind-numbing, body-wracking fear drowned it out. I would have let him die so that thing didn't get \i me\i0 . I would have - because I didn't want to die. And I found myself wondering then if I'd have let it get Tess too.{&1310}\par I didn't like where that thought would take me, so I let it go.{&1310}\par Richter had seen soemthing of what'd happened back in Shtess, so he didn't dismiss me out of hand before we went in there. None of us would take that chance. He didn't say it after we cleared the place, but I knew he thought I was having paranoid hallucinations. The problem was that I didn't know if he wasn't right. I looked in the mirror again, but that reflection didn't move on its own anymore. It had all felt so real, though.{&1310}\par Maybe the difference was that nauseating vertigo I'd gotten right before it happened. Just like back on the train.{&1310}\par A couple days later, and I had tried to forget about it. Nothing happened since then, and I eventually had to brave using the bathroom and bathing by myself.{&1310}\par "I looked into the security around the port, and it is heavier now with the pirate scare," Richter explained to us the day he'd finally gotten free enough to go take a look at how hard it'd be to get us off-planet and back home. He'd spent most of the week after escaping the train emphasizing a cover story for him not being in Shtess at all by having someone take his shift while he was sick. That someone was dead now, and Richter was apparently in a lot of trouble but, so far, no one suspected he was harboring any fugitives in his tiny, one-room apartment.{&1310}\par {&1310}\par "I wish Julian were here."{&1310}\par "I know what you mean."{&1310}\par "I don't think you do, Ev."{&1310}\par I looked at Tess, and she sighed, giving me a weirdly serious look.{&1310}\par The Eluvian had fought with Tess about killing Richter to leave no witnesses. Too bad they had security cameras onboard that train. Most of them had been wrecked in the crash and the stored video ruined when Julian blasted all the consoles, but they had gotten a few pictures of us bailing out near the station. Not enough to find us in a port city of millions, but enough to know to look. Julian had taken off after that. He'd wanted to take his chances on his own and cut ties with us as soon as possible. I couldn't blame him. Still, I felt a lot less safe without him around. Weird how that had happened.{&1310}\par {&1310}\par Oh, sure, hiding out for our lives made it hard to marvel at that. A real planetside city with not thousands but \i millions\i0  of people. All just - \i living\i0  there. I couldn't even get my head around it. And it was almost easy to forget we were trapped inside that apartment. For the first time in my life I felt claustrophobic for want of the outside. You could \i feel\i0  the life thumping dully like blood through veins just beyond the walls. It was never quiet here.{&1310}\par One day, Richter finally brought home some good news.{&1310}\par {&1310}\par {&1310}\par {&1310}\par When I came back out, Richter was there, bending over something on the floor. It took me a minute to realize it was that broken sculpture.{&1310}\par "My little brother made this," was all he said, looking at the pieces gathered tenatively in his hands. There wasn't any anger in his voice. It actually sounded kind of detached. He looked at me, and those crystal-blue eyes were actually sad. Then they abruptly lit up a bit.{&1310}\par "You're, ah - looking better today," he told me then.{&1310}\par "Is that it?" Tess abruptly butted in from behind, pointing at what the man had carried in under one arm.{&1310}\par "Oh. Yes." He glanced down at the bundle before holding it up for us. "They're the latest from Dreggoran, and quite popular right now."{&1310}\par "Ugh."{&1310}\par Tess made a sound in her throat as her face twisted. She unfolded the coat she'd snatched from him, looking less than happy about wearing it. It certainly didn't compare to the clothes she usually liked to throw on.{&1310}\par Richter handed me the other one and I unfolded it to see what Tess didn't like. It was long, tight-fighting, and fairly starched compared to what were used to back home. The neck was high, and it was a stark, conservative black. Plain and utilitarian, but still a little elegant with those fine scrolls on the hem you almost didn't notice. It was subtle. Not really Tess' style at all.{&1310}\par I hadn't paid much attention to Dreggoran fashion in the vids, but it seemed to fit, and most of the people I'd seen around there so far wore something similar at least. I supposed wearing those things would make us a bit less noticeable anyways. {&1310}\par "Hey, Ev ... look."{&1310}\par I glanced over at Tess having slipped into her Dreggoran coat. Or I guess that wasn't quite right. She'd done it up so tight it looked more like someone had \i stuffed \i0 her into it.{&1310}\par "Tax evasion is treason!" she stood stock still with a too-somber, too-earnest look on her spaced-out face. "All men twenty years or older must register with the DFB for mandatory enlistment!"{&1310}\par I laughed, and I couldn't help it. The image struck me so hard that I nearly doubled over, the sound bursting out of my mouth before I could catch it. Richter's face flushed bright red beneath his flaxen hair as I saw him get truly angry for the first time since I'd met him. I tried to cover my mouth to hide since I don't think he liked her impression of those government-sponsored messages they flashed around here.{&1310}\par "Sectarians!" he snapped, looking awkward even doing that like he suddenly had all that anger and wasn't sure just what to even do with it. His lip quivered as he ranted. "It might all be a big fucking joke to you, but you won't be laughing when the day comes the Grand Admirals decide to throw your part of the sector to the void."{&1310}\par He glared at us both, flushed and angry. Our laughter died down into ragged, punctuated peals. I look at Tess.{&1310}\par "What did he call us?"{&1310}\par She shrugged.{&1310}\par "I couldn't hear him over this collar!" {&1310}\par She pretened to gasp, pulling at the thing tight on her neck with her fingers. I lost it again.{&1310}\par Richter eventually had enough and stormed off to the side of the room that served as both the kitchen and dining room. Tess and I kept laughing for a bit at his expense while he downed some of that non-alcoholic tonic he seemed to love so much, looking embarassed and put off. For a few minutes, I forgot everything else that had happened, and it was just like being back home. For a few minutes.{&1310}\par {&1310}\par "How the hell are we supposed to ge tthrough \i that\i0 ?"{&1310}\par Tess pointed away toward the security checkpoints around the port, and Richter pushed her arm right back down instantly.{&1310}\par "Don't do that."{&1310}\par "Well?"{&1310}\par She him a dirty, expectant look.{&1310}\par "I don't know."{&1310}\par "I thought you said you could \i help\i0  us."{&1310}\par He was throwing wary glances around to the people pushing past us through a thick buzz of Dreggoran accents. They ignored us, for the most part, dressed just like anyone else might be on the street. We almost blended in.{&1310}\par "Keep your voice down," he was warning her.{&1310}\par Except for our own accents. I supposed they didn't get many "Sectarians" through there by the way Richter made it sound. Most of them showed up in Dreggor's Door or never set foot outside the orbital station here.{&1310}\par "Look, I might be able to get you through there, but not while I'm under review for what happened at Shtess and they're still looking for four fugitives in the city. You'll just have to be patient and trust me, yes? And just \i wait\i0 ."{&1310}\par "Trust you?" Tess flipped a hand and shook her head. "I don't believe this - come on, Ev."{&1310}\par But we couldn't wait. Sooner or later they'd probably figure out that Richter was on that train and at the mining town massacre. And if what Julian had said about those bounty hunters was true, I think I had more to worry about from them finding us than any port authority.{&1310}\par "Let's get out of here."{&1310}\par Tess was tugging at my arm.{&1310}\par "Okay."{&1310}\par "Not that way," but Richter pulled me back.{&1310}\par "What?"{&1310}\par "Don't want to make it look like we were scouting out the port surveillance," he said, and stepped off in the direction we'd started. "With me."{&1310}\par "Fine. Whatever."{&1310}\par {&1310}\par Then there was a banging at the door, and everyone froze.{&1310}\par For a moment - nothing. Just me and Tess and that blonde-haired man staring with wide, surprised eyes at each other around Richter's apartment. Then:{&1310}\par "Hallo! Officer Herman Richter?"{&1310}\par The voice was brusque and soulless through the metal-paneled door. We all looked at it, and that was about it for a minute. No one had ever come to the door before. For a minute, I kind of just thought I'd imagined it.{&1310}\par "Hey!" the man on the other side shouted and pounded insistently again. "Internal Investigations Division, yeah? Open the door, please!"{&1310}\par Richter swung past us before I could blink. He looked around, hesitating, like he would figure something out from that unkempt, tiny room. Then he abruptly swept a hand back through his short hair to set it out of place before tossing the last of his tonic in his face and smearing it to a sheen. He gave us an ashen look as he walked the rest of the short way to the door, hacking into his sleeve.{&1310}\par "Yeah?" He coughed, then looked up. "Who's calling, please?"{&1310}\par Some muffled talking on the other side. There was more than one out there.{&1310}\par "Officer Richter? IID," the voice said. "Could you let us in please?"{&1310}\par "Yeah."{&1310}\par He threw a desperate hand our way, and me and Tess jumped at the bathroom door like he'd shot a gun at us. We ducked inside without making too much noise. Richter winced as Tess nearly tripped over me doing it, though. I finally got behind the door while Tess slipped into the shower stall. And I peeked out into the main room.{&1310}\par Richter kept up that fake-sick act as he punched a command into the door and opened it. I waited for whoever it was to push their way aside, but Richter just spoke to them while nodding his head weakly and coughing every so often. It was too quiet to hear, and my I got paranoid waiting. No one had come around looking for him since we'd gotten there, and I had flashes in my head of what that really meant. Internal Investigations? I could guess ...{&1310}\par My pistol was with my coat on the floor. I saw it, and felt ice pour down my back. But they were too far away to grab now.{&1310}\par I looked back at the shower stall where Tess was crouched down and peering out of the dark. She mouthed something at me, but I just shook my head without understanding.{&1310}\par How could I be so \i stupid\i0  ...?{&1310}\par When I came back around, someone else was standing in the room.{&1310}\par Richter had a coughing fit. Angry, and nerve-wracking so that he collapsed into the wall beside the man. It bought me a second or two to duck all the way out of sight while that other man took a step back, giving Richter a scornful look.{&1310}\par "Are you quite alright, Officer?" a second man demanded, stepping into the apartment. That one focused on Richter while the other was looking around. "We've had some concerns with certain discrepancies on your latest shift reports with the DMTC."{&1310}\par They both wore the same black, high-necked outfit. There was protective fiberweave built into the synthetic. I wasn't sure what that was all about. Not even the Watchmen back home needed to wear that much protection.{&1310}\par Richter just nodded, recovering himself somewhat. "I've been indisposed for some days now," he managed.{&1310}\par I could just barely keep an eye out into the room past the edge of the sliding bathroom door, but it was enough to see the first man pouring over the few belongings on the floor and scattered about. My jacket was one of them. And so were those two coats.{&1310}\par "You live alone here, Officer Richter?" he asked, glancing back. "No one else resides with you?"{&1310}\par Richter quickly shook his head, but I could tell the man already knew the answer as soon as he asked. They actually were a little like the Watchmen back home, I thought. So they probably wouldn't have come unless they already knew everything they needed to about him.{&1310}\par There was color rising in Richter's cheeks to wash away the fake-sick palor he'd been working on now.{&1310}\par "Not a - girlfriend, perhaps?" the one man was holding up my jacket. I didn't like the dead look in his eyes as he did it. It was worse than the ones I used to get back home.{&1310}\par But then the other one noticed the blood. {&1310}\par {&1310}\par {&1310}\par They both had weapons out so fast, I froze - bulky pistols with more controls than I'd ever seen in person. One pushed his up under Richter's throat and had him back against the wall, the other was turning around the apartment.{&1310}\par "Stay with him," the one moving hissed. His cold, serpentine eyes snapped across the bathroom and I squeezed myself back against the wall and out of sight.{&1310}\par "And just when did you get that, Officer?" the one holding him demanded rhetorically about the bloody jacket in Richter's ear, giving a shove into his windpipe with that firebolt for good measure. "I \i don't\i0  think it fits you ..."{&1310}\par The other one had his pistol pointed toward the bathroom and me. If I'd hoped he might somehow not find us, I was wrong.

I look at Tess.{&1310}\par "What did he call us?"{&1310}\par She shrugged.{&1310}\par "I couldn't hear him over this collar!" {&1310}\par She pretened to gasp, pulling at the thing tight on her neck with her fingers. I lost it again.{&1310}\par Richter eventually had enough and stormed off to the side of the room that served as both the kitchen and dining room. Tess and I kept laughing for a bit at his expense while he downed some of that non-alcoholic tonic he seemed to love so much, looking embarassed and put off. For a few minutes, I forgot everything else that had happened, and it was just like being back home. For a few minutes.{&1310}\par {&1310}\par {&1310}\par Then there was a banging at the door, and everyone froze.{&1310}\par For a moment - nothing. Just me and Tess and that blonde-haired man staring with wide, surprised eyes at each other around Richter's apartment. Then:{&1310}\par "Hallo! Officer Herman Richter?"{&1310}\par The voice was brusque and soulless through the metal-paneled door. We all looked at it, and that was about it for a minute. No one had ever come to the door before. For a minute, I kind of just thought I'd imagined it.{&1310}\par "Hey!" the man on the other side shouted and pounded insistently again. "Internal Investigations Division, yeah? Open the door, please!"{&1310}\par Richter swung past us before I could blink. He looked around, hesitating, like he would figure something out from that unkempt, tiny room. Then he abruptly swept a hand back through his short hair to set it out of place before tossing the last of his tonic in his face and smearing it to a sheen. He gave us an ashen look as he walked the rest of the short way to the door, hacking into his sleeve.{&1310}\par "Yeah?" He coughed, then looked up. "Who's calling, please?"{&1310}\par Some muffled talking on the other side. There was more than one out there.{&1310}\par "Officer Richter? IID," the voice said. "Could you let us in please?"{&1310}\par "Yeah."{&1310}\par He threw a desperate hand our way, and me and Tess jumped at the bathroom door like he'd shot a gun at us. We ducked inside without making too much noise. Richter winced as Tess nearly tripped over me doing it, though. I finally got behind the door while Tess slipped into the shower stall. And I peeked out into the main room.{&1310}\par Richter kept up that fake-sick act as he punched a command into the door and opened it. I waited for whoever it was to push their way aside, but Richter just spoke to them while nodding his head weakly and coughing every so often. It was too quiet to hear, and my I got paranoid waiting. No one had come around looking for him since we'd gotten there, and I had flashes in my head of what that really meant. Internal Investigations? I could guess ...{&1310}\par My pistol was with my coat on the floor. I saw it, and felt ice pour down my back. But they were too far away to grab now.{&1310}\par I looked back at the shower stall where Tess was crouched down and peering out of the dark. She mouthed something at me, but I just shook my head without understanding.{&1310}\par How could I be so \i stupid\i0  ...?{&1310}\par When I came back around, someone else was standing in the room.{&1310}\par Richter had a coughing fit. Angry, and nerve-wracking so that he collapsed into the wall beside the man. It bought me a second or two to duck all the way out of sight while that other man took a step back, giving Richter a scornful look.{&1310}\par "Are you quite alright, Officer?" a second man demanded, stepping into the apartment. That one focused on Richter while the other was looking around. "We've had some concerns with certain discrepancies on your latest shift reports with the DMTC."{&1310}\par They both wore the same black, high-necked outfit. There was protective fiberweave built into the synthetic. I wasn't sure what that was all about. Not even the Watchmen back home needed to wear that much protection.{&1310}\par Richter just nodded, recovering himself somewhat. "I've been indisposed for some days now," he managed.{&1310}\par I could just barely keep an eye out into the room past the edge of the sliding bathroom door, but it was enough to see the first man pouring over the few belongings on the floor and scattered about. My jacket was one of them. And so were those two coats.{&1310}\par "You live alone here, Officer Richter?" he asked, glancing back. "No one else resides with you?"{&1310}\par Richter quickly shook his head, but I could tell the man already knew the answer as soon as he asked. They actually were a little like the Watchmen back home, I thought. So they probably wouldn't have come unless they already knew everything they needed to about him.{&1310}\par There was color rising in Richter's cheeks to wash away the fake-sick palor he'd been working on now.{&1310}\par "Not a - girlfriend, perhaps?" the one man was holding up my jacket. I didn't like the dead look in his eyes as he did it. It was worse than the ones I used to get back home.{&1310}\par But then the other one noticed the blood. {&1310}\par {&1310}\par {&1310}\par They both had weapons out so fast, I froze - bulky pistols with more controls than I'd ever seen in person. One pushed his up under Richter's throat and had him back against the wall, the other was turning around the apartment.{&1310}\par "Stay with him," the one moving hissed. His cold, serpentine eyes snapped across the bathroom and I squeezed myself back against the wall and out of sight.{&1310}\par "And just when did you get that, Officer?" the one holding him demanded rhetorically about the bloody jacket in Richter's ear, giving a shove into his windpipe with that firebolt for good measure. "I \i don't\i0  think it fits you ..."{&1310}\par The other one had his pistol pointed toward the bathroom and me. If I'd hoped he might somehow not find us, I was wrong. A light cut through the open doorway into the smaller, dark room.{&1310}\par "Come out of there," he ordered firmly. "Now."{&1310}\par I glanced at Tess, breath stuck in my throat. She shook her head quickly. Her face had gone pale in the dark.{&1310}\par "There's ... no one here!" Richter managed from the other room, and I heard a \i fwap!\i0  before him hitting the ground with a grunt.{&1310}\par "Shut your mouth, officer."{&1310}\par "Come out or I'll shoot him."{&1310}\par There was the telltale sing of a firebolt being prep'ed, and I imagined it pointed right at Richter's head.{&1310}\par "Then I'll come in there and shoot \i you\i0 ."{&1310}\par I stuck a hand out into the open doorway so he could see before anyone else could do anything. It happened so fast, I half-expected it to get melted right off to blinding fire as I did. And I waited against it, eyes squeezed shut.{&1310}\par "Okay. The rest of you."{&1310}\par Tess was next to me and trying to pull me back with her wide, desperate eyes. I pushed her away with a stern look that I couldn't even fake just then for the life of me. My head started spinning with flashes of that firebolt blasting away pieces of me as I crept them slowly out into view. My body started shaking on its own.{&1310}\par I tried to look up at the man, but all I could see was that gun pointed at my chest. It felt like gravity would suck that shot right out of the barrel and punch it through me if he didn't. And I waited for him too, holding both my hands up so he could see I didn't have any weapons to worry about.{&1310}\par {&1310}\par {&1310}\par When I came back around, Richter was standing in front of me.{&1310}\par And I must have fallen over backward in surprise because the next thing I knew Iw as on the floor.{&1310}\par "Are you alright?" he was demanding anxiously over me. I glanced past to the apartment door, but it was closed. Whatever'd been outside - they were gone now.{&1310}\par He helped me back up while Tess came out of hiding. I pushed past the man and went for my gun before he could say anything else.{&1310}\par "What'd they want?" Tess whispered, huddling by the bathroom door and throwing looks toward the front one like they might come barging through anyways. Maybe they would.{&1310}\par "Investigations," Richter said in flat tones, but I could tell they had him unnerved. "Wondering why I wasn't on the job for the Shtess run."{&1310}\par "But you were," I said.{&1310}\par "Not according to the story I spread with my brothers and sisters. It should have them assuming I faked a shift cover due to illness. They'd interview them first."{&1310}\par "Why?"{&1310}\par "Badge unaccounted for," he explained, picking a ruined bit of metal out of a drawer. The rest of the uniform he'd tossed as soon as we got away from the train. "They want me to come down as soon as I'm no longer contagious. They'll figure me out soon."{&1310}\par "So what are we gonna do then?" Tess chimed in again, still crouched behind the bathroom door and whispering across to us.{&1310}\par "Wait for them to leave," he said. "Get out of here. After that, I don't ... I don't really know. Get those coats on!"{&1310}\par \pard\sl0\slmult1\cf2\f1 {&1310}\par \pard\fi720\sl480\slmult1\cf1\f0 {&1310}\par \pard\sl0\slmult1\cf2\f1 {&1310}\par }{&1310}

It was never quiet here.{&1310}\par {&1310}\par {&1310}\par {&1310}\par They both had weapons out so fast, I froze - bulky pistols with more controls than I'd ever seen in person. One pushed his up under Richter's throat and had him back against the wall, the other was turning around the apartment.{&1310}\par "Stay with him," the one moving hissed. His cold, serpentine eyes snapped across the bathroom and I squeezed myself back against the wall and out of sight.{&1310}\par "And just when did you get that, Officer?" the one holding him demanded rhetorically about the bloody jacket in Richter's ear, giving a shove into his windpipe with that firebolt for good measure. "I \i don't\i0  think it fits you ..."{&1310}\par The other one had his pistol pointed toward the bathroom and me. If I'd hoped he might somehow not find us, I was wrong. A light cut through the open doorway into the smaller, dark room.{&1310}\par "Come out of there," he ordered firmly. "Now."{&1310}\par I glanced at Tess, breath stuck in my throat. She shook her head quickly. Her face had gone pale in the dark.{&1310}\par "There's ... no one here!" Richter managed from the other room, and I heard a \i fwap!\i0  before him hitting the ground with a grunt.{&1310}\par "Shut your mouth, officer."{&1310}\par "Come out or I'll shoot him."{&1310}\par There was the telltale sing of a firebolt being prep'ed, and I imagined it pointed right at Richter's head.{&1310}\par "Then I'll come in there and shoot \i you\i0 ."{&1310}\par I stuck a hand out into the open doorway so he could see before anyone else could do anything. It happened so fast, I half-expected it to get melted right off to blinding fire as I did. And I waited against it, eyes squeezed shut.{&1310}\par "Okay. The rest of you."{&1310}\par Tess was next to me and trying to pull me back with her wide, desperate eyes. I pushed her away with a stern look that I couldn't even fake just then for the life of me. My head started spinning with flashes of that firebolt blasting away pieces of me as I crept them slowly out into view. My body started shaking on its own.{&1310}\par I tried to look up at the man, but all I could see was that gun pointed at my chest. It felt like gravity would suck that shot right out of the barrel and punch it through me if he didn't. And I waited for him too, holding both my hands up so he could see I didn't have any weapons to worry about.{&1310}\par {&1310}\par {&1310}\par When I came back around, Richter was standing in front of me.{&1310}\par And I must have fallen over backward in surprise because the next thing I knew Iw as on the floor.{&1310}\par "Are you alright?" he was demanding anxiously over me. I glanced past to the apartment door, but it was closed. Whatever'd been outside - they were gone now.{&1310}\par He helped me back up while Tess came out of hiding. I pushed past the man and went for my gun before he could say anything else.{&1310}\par "What'd they want?" Tess whispered, huddling by the bathroom door and throwing looks toward the front one like they might come barging through anyways. Maybe they would.{&1310}\par "Investigations," Richter said in flat tones, but I could tell they had him unnerved. "Wondering why I wasn't on the job for the Shtess run."{&1310}\par "But you were," I said.{&1310}\par "Not according to the story I spread with my brothers and sisters. It should have them assuming I faked a shift cover due to illness. They'd interview them first."{&1310}\par "Why?"{&1310}\par "Badge unaccounted for," he explained, picking a ruined bit of metal out of a drawer. The rest of the uniform he'd tossed as soon as we got away from the train. "They want me to come down as soon as I'm no longer contagious. They'll figure me out soon."{&1310}\par "So what are we gonna do then?" Tess chimed in again, still crouched behind the bathroom door and whispering across to us.{&1310}\par "Wait for them to leave," he said. "Get out of here. After that, I don't ... I don't really know. Get those coats on!"{&1310}\par \pard\sl0\slmult1\cf2\f1 {&1310}\par \pard\fi720\sl480\slmult1\cf1\f0 {&1310}\par \pard\sl0\slmult1\cf2\f1 {&1310}\par }{&1310}

Water rushed everywhere around me. I was drowning. I panicked and sucked it right into my lungs through my mouth.{&1310}\par My feet and hands kicked out in every direction at once and only hit glass. Someone had slammed a fist into it, and that voice came through muffled in my ears. I couldn't make out a word. I just started thrashing my own fists back against it.{&1310}\par "LET ME OUT!"{&1310}\par I tried to scream, but started choking instead. Bubbles shot up all around, blinding me. I was drowning in a glass tube with nowhere to go. I punched the glass until my hand broke and faint whisps of blood were in the water. I couldn't see. There were supposed to be failsafes. WHY THE HELL WEREN"T THE FAILSAFES TURNING ON?!{&1310}\par "Emergency release, activated."{&1310}\par The world rushed away from me all at once and my head pitched forward into the glass. It parted once the water was all gone and my knees gave way. I was suddenly drowning in air and flung forward out onto the deck.{&1310}\par "You failed to reactivate, cadet."{&1310}\par The boots of that someone who'd pounded on my glass were standing right in front of me as I hunched over on hands and knees against the deck trying to heave out that water from inside me.{&1310}\par "This glass," he rapped some knuckles against my open tube, "is meant to withstand and protect your body from high-velocity G's that would otherwise liquefy your skeleton." He said it loud so that the whole room could hear. "But Cadet Weir thought she could break through it instead of using her manual release." {&1310}\par He abruptly got down real low beside my ear.{&1310}\par "Just what the fuck did you think you were going to doing, Weir?"{&1310}\par There were people up and about and moving quickly inside the cabin. I was the only one on the floor still naked. I still couldn't breathe.{&1310}\par "Get up, cadet." He stood and came back around in front of me again. "You didn't swallow any tank water. You had an air tube in your mouth the whole time."{&1310}\par I looked down for any holes in my chest, but there were none. It still hurt. It hurt just like it had hurt inside the dream. My hand hurt too, but that was fresh. I still could barely see past all that black. It had seeped into me.{&1310}\par "I said get the fuck up off my deck!"{&1310}\par My eyes blinked up at the fury of motion all around me, but I still had double-vision of that man in the dark. Real shapes started to come back in a rush so abruptly it made me want to turn inside out.{&1310}\par "WEIR!"{&1310}\par A hand grabbed me hard and tried to pull me up. But I just puked up all over his clean boots.\cf2\f1 {&1310}\par }{&1310}
