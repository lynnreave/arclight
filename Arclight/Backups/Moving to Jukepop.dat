An enhanced and improved edition intended for actual publication is being posted over at www.jukepopserials.com under the pen name J. Mercer -- still titled Arclight. This improved edition has an expanded universe and plot, better pacing and exposition (the number one complaint was not enough explanation of what was going on at times), as well as ambient details and technology. It should feel like a much more "lived-in" universe to those familiar with the first draft of the story. There will be some significant plot differences -- the most immediately recognizable will be the change of Chapter One from a sort of school for the psychically gifted to a military training program for psychokinetic super-soldiers. The general plot will be the same, only better executed and (hopefully) even more enjoyable to read.{&1310}\par {&1310}\par JukepopSerials.com offers the story in serial format for free to read with the option to donate to the author(s). We encourage anyone so interested to continue reading for free, as that is the most important purpose for this story -- that it be read and enjoyed. Any readers that are inclined to donate will be vastly appreciated as well, since that is the ultimate dream of most writers and one of the best sources of positive reinforcement available. That said, comments, reviews, and +1 votes (JukepopSerials.com feature) ARE still the best source of positive reinforcement. So please do so whenever possible.{&1310}\par {&1310}\par We will continue posting here, but due to the nature of the rewrites it wouldn't make sense to do so before the plot had been progressed enough to completely replace all the chapters currently posted here, which would confuse any new readers.
