What is it - exactly?"{&1310}\par Tess pointed at that tower in the distance while we walked. The railway we had left behind quickly enough. Now we were trudging through some industrial yards that reminded me a lot of Dane Fitzpatrick's loading and maintenance bays. Except with a lot more dirt, grass, and open sky.{&1310}\par "Hey!" the other woman snapped exhaustedly at the Eluvian man after he ignored her. "You wanna tell me? Okay?"{&1310}\par He kept on ignoring her, though, and marching ahead. I wondered if he would ever just fall apart from all that running. I know I was already.{&1310}\par "Hey!"{&1310}\par Tess shouted after him, half-stomping, half-stumbling, ahead to catch a hold of his arm. He twisted it instantly out of her grip.{&1310}\par "Quiet," he growed at her, still moving forward with his eyes darting about. I started to feel a creeping worry up my spine. Tess just kept right at it.{&1310}\par "Tell me where you're taking us, and I'll be quiet!" she snapped back.{&1310}\par He stopped at that of a sudden, and glanced back at her.{&1310}\par "Is that a promise you can keep?"{&1310}\par Tess just gave him a dirty look.{&1310}\par "I'm not taking \i you\i0  anywhere," he told her, slinking up against the side of one of those buildings with the large, steel doors and peeking around the corner into the road running past. He kept his voice low.{&1310}\par "I'm getting off this moon. You're just deadweight dragging behind."{&1310}\par "Hey!" Tess poked a finger in his face. "You're the one who told us to stay with you back at the train, ass!"{&1310}\par Julian looked at her. Then me behind. And then back to the road.{&1310}\par "Not the first mistake I made," was all he said about that. He canted his head, and tightened the grip on his rifle. "Keep up, and keep quiet."{&1310}\par Tess started muttering something about shooting him in the ass as we took off into the street after. The Eluvian man kept low, and close to the buildings with his gun ready. I followed his lead, eying those shadows around us that were looking very still and quiet now. "What's wrong?" I whispered up at him, though I had a good idea of what. Riftwatch's loading bays had never been so lifeless.{&1310}\par "Nothing?" Tess tossed back at me with a look.{&1310}\par Julian ignored her. {&1310}\par "There's no one out here."{&1310}\par Tess took a second to process that, glancing quickly about. Then she stopped right where she was.{&1310}\par "Do you think the train made it all the way here?"{&1310}\par "I'd be surprised if it didn't," the Eluvian man grunted back, crouching down even lower as we came up behind some abandoned crates and huge, open drums.{&1310}\par "S-so," Tess choked out, "where is it now?"{&1310}\par "Get down, and get up here," Julian snapped at her.{&1310}\par He watched the industrial yards ahead of us for a while. Between that and the road, there was a lot of open space to get spotted. And plenty of buildings, abandoned stock, and machines to not. We waited.{&1310}\par I waited for something to move. Anything. I wasn't sure what the Eluvian man was looking for exactly. But Tess was the first one to break the silence.{&1310}\par "Why don't we-"{&1310}\par "Shhh," Julian hushed her instantly.

Whatever he was thinking, though, it couldn't have been good. It was painfully silent, and I tried to hold each breath back from rattling aloud in the stillness.

Tess tried to go with him, but he waved her back with a firm hand and look. Then he slipped off into the night.{&1310}\par "Where the hell is he going?" she whispered back at me as soon as he had vanished from sight between the crease of two buildings across the road.

But it didn't matter.{&1310}\par Bolts of fire suddenly hurtled in at us from everywhere all at once.{&1310}\par The crackle and pop of old wood and metal filled the air with bright flashes of smoldering stars around us. I wrapped my arms around my head and collapsed in on myself. Tess scrambled in the dirt, shrieking beside me.{&1310}\par I think those crates and barrels came apart. I got a whiff of smoke - then gagged on it. The night lit on fire everywhere around and roared right alongside all that gunfire.{&1310}\par Tess tried to run, and tripped. Which was good. Because a flurry of firebolts carried away everything right over her head.{&1310}\par I just sat there, heat and fire blasting at me from behind, drenched in a sweat both hot and cold at the same time. Frozen. I don't know how long. Tess scrunched up against the dirt. We both just waited for that sudden maelstrom to finish us off.{&1310}\par Too bad it didn't.{&1310}\par The gunfire stopped, and the world grew quiet again. Those flames still crackled behind, eating up all of those crates and barrels to ash and charred metal.{&1310}\par The smoke was suffocating. I pitched forward alongside Tess against the ground, hacking into the dirt.{&1310}\par I was laying there for a while before a hand grabbed my shoulder and flipped me over onto my back.{&1310}\par Panic.{&1310}\par My musces were gagged, and too slow. I couldn't move quickly enough.{&1310}\par It was just Tess.{&1310}\par Hunched over and looking like she'd been beaten with a bulkhead. Julian too, with his rifle. I squinted up at him.{&1310}\par "Let's move. They came in on a rover."{&1310}\par I managed to get back up after another minute. Then stumble along behind, waving away as much smoke from the blaze our hiding spot had becom now as I could without puking into the dirt. It gave us a good look at the bodies scattered around with bolt-holes punched right through them.{&1310}\par "Who the hell were these guys?" I heard Tess cry out, still rattled and looking like she'd collapse any second. I took another look around at the dark body armor and black face-shields.{&1310}\par "Planetary security," Julian grunted back at us. And that caught the other woman up dead in her tracks more than us nearly getting beaten, thrown around, cut apart, and gunned down in the past day or so.{&1310}\par "What?" she all but shrieked. "And you just \i killed\i0  them?"{&1310}\par "I could have let them kill you instead," he said simply.{&1310}\par "What?" she cried again. "No, no, no, no, no - " and backed up a few, halting steps. "I can't - I can't do this."{&1310}\par She rounded back on me, stumbling.{&1310}\par "Come on, Eve. We're getting the hell away from this maniac."{&1310}\par She grabbed my arm, trying to pull me away back the way we had come. There wasn't much strength in it, though.{&1310}\par "You go back that way," Julian called after - too calm. His voice was just too even. "And you will never get off this moon."{&1310}\par I had a flash of that man back on this ship - stabbing Dad right through the back with that gleaming length of black steel. A sword? They only used those in old vids about centuries ago.{&1310}\par Tess was talking, but I squeezed my eyes shut.{&1310}\par "And stay here with a murderer? Pfft! Like that'll get us out of here any quicker. Probably kill us too, and ... and sell our dead bodies or - or something!"{&1310}\par "Fine. You do whatever you want."{&1310}\par "We will! Come on, Eve. Let's get outta here."{&1310}\par My eyes popped back open at that tug on my arm.{&1310}\par The Eluvian man had already turned back and started ahead again. Tess was trying to pull me back the other way. I looked at her. And I bared my teeth.{&1310}\par "I'm getting off this moon, Tess."{&1310}\par She stared back with a desperate, forlorn bent to her face. I reversed the grip in an instant. Then I was tugging her along behind me.{&1310}\par "What the hell are you doing?"{&1310}\par She fought. But she gave up too easily. And then she was just trying to keep up with me trying to keep up with Julian. He didn't seem too surprised to find us behind him again. Tess tried grumbling venemously the whole way. But she hardly had the strength for that either.{&1310}\par We followed him another klick or so. There, he started looking around until he found something that looked like a much less friendly version of that old man's truck with a large gun mounted on the top, hidden away between buildings and storage bins. If it hadn't been for Julian, Tess and I never could have found it. Like he knew exactly where to look.{&1310}\par "Get in," he snapped at us, tossing himself inside and into the driver's seat without even a glance back.{&1310}\par \cf2 {&1310}\par }{&1310}
