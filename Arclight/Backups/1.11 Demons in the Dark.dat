I felt my lungs start to seize up. Both legs were stiff, stuck at awkward angles to the floor. Knees were no better, trembling. I stood there, unable to move.

But it wasn't real.{&1310}\par It wasn't real.{&1310}\par I took a deep breath. Somehow. And opened my eyes again, slowly. Emergency lights had come on, painting the passage with specks of dim red. They didn't do much at all. But I wasn't going to be lost in the dark down there.{&1310}\par Something loomed right next to my head.{&1310}\par My legs gave out, even before the rush and gargling scream.

My arm sliced open and whatever it was punched a hole in the deck. I spun around on my back in the blood on the ground, and both feet went flying. One managed to hit the thing somewhere.{&1310}\par It hit me again. Something blunt this time because it sent me sliding away down the hall. I slapped the deck and leapt back up to my feet, stumbled a few steps, and slipped into a door. It was shut tight.{&1310}\par I froze for one, terrible moment.

Pretty soon, it filled up the whole corridor.{&1310}\par I sucked in, squeezed, and screamed. Hands scrabbling on both sides, I smeared blood all over the doors, fingers sliding all over.

And it took me a moment, as I slid wildly ahead into another wall, to realize that it wasn't water making the floor so wet.{&1310}\par And when I came back up, that thing was screaming right in my face.{&1310}\par It slashed something at me. My arm sliced open and whatever it was punched a hole in the deck. I spun around on my back in the blood on the ground, and both feet went flying. One managed to hit the thing somewhere.{&1310}\par It hit me again. Something blunt this time because it sent me sliding away down the hall. I slapped the deck and leapt back up to my feet, stumbled a few steps, and slipped into a door. It was shut tight.{&1310}\par I froze for one, terrible moment. That warbling started up again behind me, charging. Maybe it had never stopped.{&1310}\par But then I saw it. The door was open. Just a little.{&1310}\par I flung myself at the hole. And got stuck partway through.{&1310}\par The thing was just a big, black splotch against the blotted, dull lights. Pretty soon, it filled up the whole corridor.{&1310}\par I sucked in, squeezed, and screamed. Hands scrabbling on both sides, I smeared blood all over the doors, fingers sliding all over. I didn't look back. Couldn't. Even as it gargled another vicious howl at me, I clawed my way through the door. It swiped that razor-sharp something for my head. {&1310}\par And then I was through.{&1310}\par I got halfway down the next corridor before I realized it, though.{&1310}\par  I looked down at my arm - at the blood dribbling down the length of it. It shook so hard it was difficult to see in the dim light. And I had no idea how bad it was. But I couldn't care just then anyways.{&1310}\par That thing was still caught in the door. I didn't look back, but I could hear it slashing at metal and screaming at me, trying to get through. I never stopped. Barely slowed.{&1310}\par I just kept on running in the dark.\cf2\f2 {&1310}\par }{&1310}
