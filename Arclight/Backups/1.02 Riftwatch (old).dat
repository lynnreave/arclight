I was looking around, and down. A lot of the old professors and researchers liked to think out loud or whatever while walking around the painstakingly manicured gardens. But I recognized an all too familiar head of abnormally pink hair peeking out amongst stark suits and green shrubbery.{&1310}\par "Hey! Tess! Up here!"{&1310}\par The other woman turned around and craned her neck back, looking up. I waved exaggeratedly down. She could have barely heard me from over the dull roar of all the fountains.{&1310}\par And I couldn't hear her as she tried to shout back up at me. I just called down again.{&1310}\par "Hold on! I'll be right there!"{&1310}\par I slung my bags back into place and stumbled my way down and around the walkways to her.{&1310}\par She gave me a funny look as I hurried up.{&1310}\par "Hey," I said again, only a little out of breath. I swung the bags around and let them flop onto the deck. "What are you up to?"{&1310}\par Those bright green eyes bounced with the travel cases, smirking. She kept giving me that all too familiar, snarky look.{&1310}\par "Shouldn't you be studying somewhere, Ev?"{&1310}\par She even threw her head a little into it. {&1310}\par And I just stood up straight. Towering my couple inches over her. Not that she ever let her irritation at that show.{&1310}\par "Shouldn't you be cleaning up something?"{&1310}\par She half-snickered and turned, that smile still painted on her face. She shrugged.{&1310}\par "If he can catch me, maybe I will."{&1310}\par A few of the old men traipsing about the grounds were giving us the stink-eye. From running around during the day or shirking whatever they thought we should be doing, who knew. Both of us had long since learned to ignore them. You think they would have done the same.{&1310}\par "Speaking of which," I started. And pulled a datastick out of my jacket pocket to give to her. "All the books for the past week."{&1310}\par The other woman lit up at that, taking the thing eagerly and tucking it away in a pocket. I pursed my lips at it, though it had become only habit by now. I was already sick of them before dad even opened his mouth. Not her, though. I guess it was easier to want what you couldn't have.{&1310}\par "So. Ev," the other woman gestured with both her arms folded across her chest. "You gonna tell me what all those are for?"{&1310}\par I glanced back down at my bags.{&1310}\par "Oh. Yeah."{&1310}\par I only managed to hold on to the suspense for a fraction of a second. Then I told her everything that my father had said - verbatim. I got to watch her eyes get bigger and bigger with each word. And, by the end, she was standing there with her mouth hanging open even worse than mine had been.{&1310}\par "What the hell ..." she gaped, staring at me,  like it was my fault. She shook her head. "That's-" her eyes dance around in frustration, "That's such \i bullshit\i0 !"{&1310}\par I almost laughed at the look on her face. Well, I did. And quickly caught it as best I could.{&1310}\par "Sorry."{&1310}\par It was hard to choke it down, though.{&1310}\par Tess stomped away a few steps. Fuming.{&1310}\par When she came back, she was still red-faced and livid. She growled at empty space.{&1310}\par "What about me?" she groaned. "That thing didn't even say anything \i about \i0 you."{&1310}\par "What thing?"{&1310}\par She shook her head quickly. "Nothing. Nevermind." And growled again.{&1310}\par "God ...!"{&1310}\par She ranted for a bit, and I kind of listened. There was an "outdoor" lecture going on in the courtyards, though. About old Haakon and the philosophical predictions he made while ruminating centuries ago on the station under the light of the Rift. I had to read them too, as pedantic and over-interpreted as they were. Most of the monks actually thought that lightshow out in space gave old Haakon some clairvoyant insight or something. Maybe give some of them a brilliant breakthrough too. All I knew was that it made the flowers in the gardens bloom a pretty, serpentine sort of violet that everyone thought was just amazing. They made sure that gaping skylight out to space stayed open.{&1310}\par Eventually, Tess started to burn herself out. Or, at least, she got tired of raving for a disinterested audience. Not that it wouldn't have been nice to take the other woman with me, since we were best friends and all. But it was still something to make her jealous for once.{&1310}\par Neither one of us had ever left the station. Ever. Riftwatch had been our home from the moment we got there. Almost two decades for me. Less a year or two for Tess. And while I had the pleasure of endless lectures and mindless studying in the archives, she got to live with fat, old Bertram running one of the local dormitories for travelers to the Rift. Itinerant scholars and intellectuals, mostly. Tess ended up doing most of the cleaning more often than not. And I wasn't sure who to pity more.{&1310}\par She knew that. I could see the frantic look in her eyes. She had gotten past furious now and was ready to start pleading. Those green eyes welled up big and earnest beneath her pink hair.{&1310}\par "You have to bring me something back, Ev," she all but begged. And then took on a harder edge. "I \i will \i0 hate you if you don't."{&1310}\par "Well, of course."{&1310}\par But apparently it wasn't so obvious to her that I would, because she had to tell me five more times and make me swear about a dozen binding oaths before she would let it go. And by then I think even I was almost bored with the thought of leaving already.{&1310}\par "So," she transitioned seemlessly with a flip of her hair, "you going to go look for old Weir-do now?" And fixed me with an unforgiving, defeated eye.{&1310}\par I barked a laugh back at her. "You going to go back to helping Bertram now?"{&1310}\par Again, she shrugged, looking away. She shook her head.{&1310}\par "I've got all day to do his chores. By the way, you- oh no ..."{&1310}\par Her eyes had gone wide again. This time, in horror. And I spun around to see where she was looking.{&1310}\par "What?"{&1310}\par I got my answer just as quickly. Part of it, anyways. A familiar man in an untidy coat strained over his bulky uniform was making his way right toward us. Fast.{&1310}\par I twisted right back around at Tess.{&1310}\par "What did you do?"{&1310}\par I started to cry out at her. But I only got part way. Before I even opened my mouth, she was moving.{&1310}\par "Nothing. Run!" she shouted back over her shoulder at me, not bothering to wait. And then, a split second later, "Now!"{&1310}\par "Hey!"{&1310}\par I snatched up my bags without thinking, but the second twisted over before I could get it all the way around and hit the ground again. Tess was already clear across the walkway. She vanished around a bend in the gardens before I even managed to get all my things hooked back on me.{&1310}\par And by then, it was too late.{&1310}\par I stumbled a few steps. Nearly tripped over flat on my face twice. And had just enough time to watch the uniformed man make the last few steps easy on himself catching up with me.{&1310}\par A big hand clamped down hard on one shoulder, twisting bone. It pulled me up fast.{&1310}\par "And just where do you think you're going?"{&1310}\par I think I heard my heart sink at the sound of his voice.
