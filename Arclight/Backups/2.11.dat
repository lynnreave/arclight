She didn't sound like she had cared much and I \i guess\i0  she hadn't said \i anything\i0  about a rescue so ... {&1310}\par I wanted to chew on my nails, or -- or squeeze my forehead or ... \i something\i0  to keep from flipping the fuck out at that pause that went on forever. I had to be professional. They must have been military. They \i sounded\i0  military. And I didn't want to be treated like just some dumb, unimportant civilian right now. I wanted out of this black, empty nothingness NOW.{&1310}\par That wait went on for minutes. It felt like hours. And I had this image of them ignoring me altogether while a desperate battle raged on inside my head.{&1310}\par "Hello?" I tried again, finally. \i Desperately\i0 . "Is anyone still there? This is Evelyn Weir and I need he-"{&1310}\par "Unit and designation, please."{&1310}\par Someone new. A new voice broke in on top of me, cutting me off. A man this time.{&1310}\par "Yes! I'm here -- I mean, this is Evelyn Weir and I need someone to come and get me. Situation ... critical?"{&1310}\par "Unit and designation, please," that voice repeated perfunctorily.{&1310}\par "What? I don't \i have\i0  any of those, I'm just ... \i stuck\i0  out here."{&1310}\par This guy wasn't yelling at me like the other one. I briefly wondered what the hell had even happened to her, but ...{&1310}\par \i God\i0 . T\i hat bitch probably \i0 did \i just blow me off.{&1310}\par \i0 Fuck, this guy better not too.{&1310}\par There was an annoyed sigh over the comm that I barely caught. Not a good sign. Then his voice again.{&1310}\par "What sector are in? Extractions are authorized for KIAs only."{&1310}\par "Well, I'm not dead!"{&1310}\par I don't know why I felt like yelling that at him, but I did.{&1310}\par Another sigh.{&1310}\par "Your name again?" he asked. I told him. Then I waited for another pause while the comm went quiet.{&1310}\par \i This had better not go like the last one or I'll ... I'll ...\i0 {&1310}\par I didn't know \i what \i0 I'd do. Nothing? What could I do? Probably nothing.{&1310}\par \i Fuck\i0 .{&1310}\par I waited again. I looked at the ship's hull and tried to put my other hand through to rub my forehead but only bumped into faceplate. I just needed someone to come get me! How hard could that be? I didn't even want to \i think\i0  about what it would mean to be left alone out here too long. Those creepy monsters back in the research tower were beginning to almost seem more appealing than -- than suffocating to death!{&1310}\par Or ... no. {&1310}\par No.{&1310}\par Getting eaten was still worse.{&1310}\par Yeah.{&1310}\par How had this leave gone from fretting over dad and failing out of the academy to debating what was the worst way to die anyways? {&1310}\par \i Poor life decisions, I guess.\i0 {&1310}\par Another salvo of pods overhead. I watched themIt was sometime while just sitting there waiting for my lifeline to come back that panic died down and some sense returned. Enough, anyways, to remember those pods.{&1310}\par I was too far away from the station to see, but they could only have meant fighting. An attack. Who? Pirates? There was no way pirates could have gotten this close and through all the regional defenses. Tau? Maybe, but Riftwatch was far from the borders of their space, and they were getting further away with each year. It wasn't a great target to open a new war on if that's what was happening.{&1310}\par I kept looking at those pods. Then I slowly came back around to where they had shot out. I was hugging an enemy ship. There was no wa they were friendlies with everything I had already seen. Right?{&1310}\par How far away I'd flown from the station really started to dawn on me then. I'd been shouting into an open frequency, but who would be listening for it if they were under attack? \i Especially\i0  if anywhere else was half as bad as what I'd seen in the research tower.{&1310}\par She'd thought I was a marine.{&1310}\par Station military details wouldn't be broadcasting out this far if they were under attack ...{&1310}\par "Excuse me ... Miss Weir?"{&1310}\par Right?{&1310}\par "Miss Weir, are you still there?"{&1310}\par I noticed that change in tone now. She'd been clipped, impatient -- professional, the way an ops command comms officer might be -- before. Now she was polite, still impatient, but in a more eager or desperate way and was trying to keep that in check like she wanted something. From \i me\i0 .{&1310}\par A command deck comms officer would be someone maybe listening for chatter on short-range frequencies. Right? A comms officer that was part of the attack.{&1310}\par "Miss Weir?"{&1310}\par "... yeah?"{&1310}\par "I asked if you could please tell me where you are so I can send someone to come get you."{&1310}\par \i Oh my god I'm talking to the enemy.\i0 {&1310}\par  "Is something wrong?" that too-nice voice nagged me on again. I'd been staring at the ship in shock and must've givern her soem long, awkward pauses.{&1310}\par "Uhhh, no. Nothing," I stammered. "The situation resolved itself." And I promptly switched my comm right off.{&1310}\par I floated there for a few seconds, heart racing. Knowing they could probably trace the origin of my signal if they wanted to. And it sounded like they would.{&1310}\par She'd gotten weird about it as soon as she'd looked up my name. If those memories hadn't come trickling back, I wouldn't have noticed or even cared, but they had. Those two men had been trying to get to me back on the station. Mohawk and Beardface. Why had they wanted me? No idea. But it wasn't at all just paranoid to make a connection between that attempted kidnapping{&47}murder and those people attacking the station.{&1310}\par Wait.{&1310}\par They couldn't just be looking for \i me\i0 , could they?{&1310}\par No. No, that would be \i crazy \i0 ...{&1310}\par As crazy as two guys trying to kidnap me in th emiddle of the night?{&1310}\par No. It was \i way\i0  crazier than that even. Like, by a \i lot\i0 . Attacking the whole \i station\i0 ? A guarded military research station? No freaking way I was worth that much to \i anyone\i0 .{&1310}\par The thought made me laugh out of context. Wow, that would've been flattering in a weird way.{&1310}\par Dad.
