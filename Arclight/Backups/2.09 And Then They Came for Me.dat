Enough to rush back to my quarters without anyone paying me any more mind. No matter how many families they tried to stuff into this deep space base, it was a military station first and foremost, and you just didn't see people running down the corridors without a damn good reason. {&1310}\par Everyone and everything was smart. Orderly. Controlled. Just like the Grand Admirals liked it. Just like Dad liked it.{&1310}\par Everyone and everything in their proper place at the appropriate time. Everyone and everything, that is, except ... me -- apparently.{&1310}\par "Please do not obstruct this unit or its faculties."{&1310}\par I snapped back to a custodial unit popping out of the door behind. It pinged me with that deadpan voice. I must have stood there too long. Warning yellow lights flashed on top of its squared head -- as close to yelling at me for loitering there as it could possibly get.{&1310}\par "Shut up," I told it. But I still pushed off out of its way.{&1310}\par All of those things had monitoring feeds and reported suspicious behavior back to station security, as me and Tess had found out all too long ago. Every bulkhead, every door -- probably every \i person \i0 too. All recording sensory data all the time and it was all controlled and accessible by the Watchmen. That was why they called them that. Well, that and for the name of the station. They were "watching" all the time, keeping things tidy and clean and under control for whatever Grand Admiral happened to be paying attention to his or her pet research projects for the time being. It was easy to forget that after living there for so long. And it wasn't like being at the Academy was so different.{&1310}\par I didn't need any unwanted attention from a janitor bot either.{&1310}\par So I trudged back to the main thoroughfare. I hadn't had any destination in mind other than "away" when I'd first started running. I was pretty sure Mills had stopped following me after those first few minutes, when he seemed like he was trying to chase me down or something. Now I managed to keep myself calm enough to walk my way all the way to the other side of the station, back to my quarters, without losing it again or anything. It helped that I was trying not to think about Dad while I did. A little. But it was hard. It was really, really hard.{&1310}\par By the time I got to the little block of cells where my room was, there was no one really left out and about in sight. Just one very drunk marine propping himself up against a bulkhead near the junction at the end of the corridor. I brought up my wrist comm and buzzed Tess from outside my front door.{&1310}\par "Where are you?" I asked as soon as that tiny holo of her appeared to answer. It was much more harshly than I meant to.{&1310}\par "Uhhh, working?"{&1310}\par "Can you ..." I started, and then stopped, and bit my lip. I realized I didn't know what I wanted. To be alone? That's what I had thought on the way back before I called up Tess on reflex. It was reflex. Subconscious. I guess I \i didn't\i0  really want to be alone right now.{&1310}\par She was busy, so I thought about going to see her at Bertram's ... but I didn't exactly want to walk into a room full of strangers getting drunk at the moment. Other people did when they felt like I did -- I'd seen and overheard so many things while hanging out there with Tess late at night that it should've been easy to fit in. But I didn't want to be one of them.{&1310}\par I shook my head.{&1310}\par "Nevermind," I told her quickly. "Forget it."{&1310}\par "Ev, wha-"{&1310}\par I cut the holo off before she could finish, and part of me felt even worse for a second about that. That part of me that knew I had probably just ruined her night with wondering what the hell was wrong with me and had made me call up only to hang up. Hopefully, she'd forget it like I told her to. Hopefully, she'd move on and just see me again tomorrow after I'd had some time to work through it alone.{&1310}\par Hopefully.{&1310}\par Probably not.{&1310}\par My door slid open and I stepped inside my little quarters, growling pitifully at what I'd just done to Tess as well as how red and swollen my eyes must have looked. Another reason I wouldn't have dared go. I just covered up with my palms and stood there instead, taking deep breaths in and out in the dark for a minute and feeling sorry for myself. At least no one would have to see me again tonight.{&1310}\par Then I felt ... something.{&1310}\par My hands dropped away from my face instantly. The room was dark and, for a moment, I was suddenly too scared to command the lights on. Or even say anything at all. I immediately recognized that feeling a split second later for what it was. The room wasn't empty. Muscle memory from years of living there and I could feel the subtle difference in air flow. {&1310}\par I don't know why I didn't call out, but it was lucky that I hadn't. That first "hello?" was always the beginning of the end for some dumb extra in the vids, and it probably would've been mine. I dropped down low toward the deck instead.{&1310}\par I didn't know why I did \i that\i0  either. Too many months watching pulse rifles blast at cadets' faceplates, probably, and getting enough stunbolt shots to my face as well. But a second later, and I was lucky that I had.{&1310}\par Something flashed over me. I felt the air rush, hissing faintly in my ears. I swear it was just an inch over where my head had been. I wasn't hit, but whoever it was inside my room didn't know that. My first instinct was to run, but I froze up instead. That second stretched on too long and I did the only other thing I could think to do. I let myself collapse down to the floor in a heap. {&1310}\par And that must have been what whoever it was had been waiting for because the lights flashed on in the next instant.{&1310}\par I only got a split second to see what was going on. Two men, one with a pulse pistol still aimed at where my head had been. It shifted fluidly downward to where I lay on the floor and my eyes squeezed shut. I waited for the follow-up shot to make sure I was down for good.{&1310}\par Why the fuck hadn't I run?!?{&1310}\par "Check her," one of them said. I think it was that one with his gun pointed at me. I couldn't remember if the other one had had a gun too -- all I'd seen was his one hand on the manual switch for the lights. He must have been the one coming around my bed toward me on the floor.{&1310}\par I had to let myself go as limp as possible. It was hard. Blood was pumping in my ears so loudly I was sure they'd hear it, and my stupid brain was in a panicked frenzy trying to figure out what they were doing there and what was going on that involved me getting shot in the head inside my own room.{&1310}\par How had they even gotten guns in here? Only the Watchmen and some marine details were even \i allowed\i0  to carry weapons. And I was pretty damn sure some alarms should have been going off at that live discharge inside the station!{&1310}\par Was it supposed to kill me? I didn't breathe. But that guy would know real quick that I wasn't dead as soon as he got close enough to see.{&1310}\par I had this image in my head of him yelling that I was still alive a split second after checking my pulse, and me with my eyes popping open in terror only to be gunned down helplessly there on the floor. Some tragically quick and sloppy end for the hero ...{&1310}\par Except heroes didn't die. They never died. \i People \i0 did.{&1310}\par His fingers touched my wrist and then my neck. They stayed limp no matter how much I wanted to tense up, ready for that next shot. But he just grunted, "She's out," and stood back up.{&1310}\par I'd completely forgotten the convenient lack of charge burns on my face that would have tipped them off instantly if the shot had been meant to kill. They must have been using stunners ... \i Why\i0 ?{&1310}\par \i Does it matter?\i0 {&1310}\par  I tried to keep a spatial awareness of what they were doing. The one who hadn't shot me was moving over to the door -- confirmed by it opening. He didn't leave, though. I imagined him sticking his head out to see if the coast was clear. It probably still was.{&1310}\par Why weren't the alarms going off?{&1310}\par Oh god, don't tell me there weren't really any after all!{&1310}\par No one was going to save me.{&1310}\par \i Shut up\i0 ! I tried to yell at myself.{&1310}\par Calm down.{&1310}\par There were security measures all over the place. Armed Watchmen, officers, and marines on duty. Strict docking and undocking protocols to follow. Cargo inventory checks. They couldn't just take me anywhere without tipping \i someone\i0  off, right? They'd have had an easier time of just killing me before they inevitably got caught.{&1310}\par That was ...{&1310}\par I hoped they didn't realize that.{&1310}\par But they'd gotten in here, though. And with guns. No one had stopped them. And what good was security all over going to do for me if they somehow managed to get out again before anyone even noticed?{&1310}\par No good at all ...{&1310}\par That sinking feeling in my guts made me start to tense up without realizing it. The one who'd shot me was standing over me now. I could feel his eyes, and that only made it worse.{&1310}\par "You said she was out," he said back at the other one. It wasn't a question. And I felt the cosmic weight of that gun shifting toward me like it was some kind of force of nature.{&1310}\par \i Oh shit\i0 .{&1310}\par I kicked out without thinking. Or aiming. Or even knowing where that guy actually was except by what I'd heard and felt. But I guess I got him, because that shot went wide and plasma fizzled into the carpet next to my head. I snapped my eyes open and let my other foot fly -- right on target this time -- and I got him square in the knee.{&1310}\par If he hadn't been wearing what felt like armored plating there, I probably would have smashed it. As it was, he stumbled back, grunting in surprise and trying to catch his balance with my bed and the wall and failing. That gun fell out of his hand.{&1310}\par The other guy spun back around. He did have a gun, but it was a knife he clutched tightly in his hand just then -- a big, wicked looking thing that he rushed at me with. I only got to my knees before he was on top of me with it, stabbing. So I snatched that extended arm by the wrist and elbow and half-pushed, half-pulled it across in front of me, just like he was Komi on the goddamned mat!{&1310}\par Except not Komi. {&1310}\par And with a knife. {&1310}\par And probably meaning to actually kill me.{&1310}\par But it worked.{&1310}\par He stumbled past my right shoulder, slicing open the sleeve, and sprawled into the floor without his balance. I didn't wait to see if he'd drawn blood. I scrambled up over his bulky body and threw myself at the door before either of them could get up again.{&1310}\par "\i Gethergoddamnit\i0 !"{&1310}\par Outside I hit the opposite bulkhead, adrenaline pumping so strong I barely felt it. I pushed away and charged down the empty corridor back towards the thoroughfare and people. There would be two more turns and then I'd be out in the open. I ran. I ran faster than I ever had in PT. I ran like Lieutenant Morisant himself was right there behind me egging me on.{&1310}\par And the whole time I just waited for that pulse blast to hit me in the back.{&1310}\par Footsteps chased after me, but that was it. Heavy, and desperate. He was taller than me and ate up that ground fast. I don't know why he didn't just shoot me like they'd tried to before, and I almost wish he would have when I pictured that ugly knife coming hurtling at me with all the force of his charging body from behind.{&1310}\par I got to the end of the corridor, but he was on top of me again. There was only one person in sight -- that drunk marine at the other end of the hall. I ducked right and away from the turn instead of left, and the guy with the knife flew into the bulkhead instead of me. "HELP!" I screamed at that drunk man, now staring bleary-eyed and uncomprehending at me. "I NEED HELP!"{&1310}\par I jumped over the knife guy trying to get back up and kept screaming at the top of my lungs while I pawed at my wrist comm to quick-call Tess, Dad -- \i anyone\i0 ! Bertram came up first for some reason. I just punched it.{&1310}\par Alphabetical. Right. Duh.{&1310}\par \i Who cares?!?\i0 {&1310}\par "Bertram pick up!" I screamed impatiently while it tried to go through.{&1310}\par Then my feet flew out from under me.{&1310}\par My legs were snatched back so hard and fast that I went face-first into the deck. I didn't even realize it until I woke up a couple seconds later. There was the salty-sweet taste of blood in my mouth and my whole head was throbbing, especially the left side. I tried to blink it away. Pain shot through that whole part of my face instead.{&1310}\par The knife guy was stalking past me. I froze and watched as he trudged right up to that drunk marine without a single word and slammed the other man's head right into the bulkhead. I heard the crunch. I gaped, sucking in ragged breaths on the floor, and watched the marine crumple like so much dead meat. {&1310}\par That guy had killed him like he was nothing. Just for \i being \i0 there.{&1310}\par Then he was coming back for me.{&1310}\par I tried to get back up, but nothing was working right. My legs wouldn't move. I panicked, but looked down at them and saw the wire. It was wrapped tight around both my shins with two counterweights, squeezing them together. I fumbled to untie them and felt a boot slam into my back.{&1310}\par I might have blacked out again. I don't know. I couldn't breath for so long I was sure I'd die too. Something grabbed my wrist and I blinked, looking that way to see the knife guy rear back and slam his fist into the comm.{&1310}\par Pain exploded in my arm and I screamed. Or tried to. All that came out was a hoarse squeak. It felt like he'd punched my wrist into pieces. I stared at my fingers as I tried to flex them and they moved, but not without screaming back at me.{&1310}\par That guy with the knife had picked up the weights on my legs and started dragging me back the way we'd come. My face scraped the floor.{&1310}\par Bulkheads with too-bright overhead lights floated past. They didn't shield them in this part of the station. Not like where people like Dad stayed. I reached my good hand lazily out to grab something but just ended up getting both arms trailing roughly along the deck behind me. It felt dirty like it hadn't seen a maintenance bot in days. It probably hadn't.{&1310}\par The gunman was standing against the door of my room when we rounded the corner. He had one hand on the bulkhead and another on his knee. The one I'd all but kicked in. At least there was that much. He grunted into his wrist as we got close.{&1310}\par "We got her."\cf2\f1 {&1310}\par }{&1310}

I panicked, but looked down at them and saw the wire. It was wrapped tight around both my shins with two counterweights, squeezing them together. I fumbled to untie them and felt a boot slam into my back.{&1310}\par I might have blacked out again. I don't know. I couldn't breath for so long I was sure I'd die too. Something grabbed my wrist and I blinked, looking that way to see the knife guy rear back and slam his fist into the comm.{&1310}\par Pain exploded in my arm and I screamed. Or tried to. All that came out was a hoarse squeak. It felt like he'd punched my wrist into pieces. I stared at my fingers as I tried to flex them and they moved, but not without screaming back at me.{&1310}\par That guy with the knife had picked up the weights on my legs and started dragging me back the way we'd come. My face scraped the floor.{&1310}\par Bulkheads with too-bright overhead lights floated past. They didn't shield them in this part of the station. Not like where people like Dad stayed. I reached my good hand lazily out to grab something but just ended up getting both arms trailing roughly along the deck behind me. It felt dirty like it hadn't seen a maintenance bot in days. It probably hadn't.{&1310}\par The gunman was standing against the door of my room when we rounded the corner. He had one hand on the bulkhead and another on his knee. The one I'd all but kicked in.

Enough to rush back to my quarters without anyone paying me any more mind. No matter how many families they tried to stuff into this deep space base, it was a military station first and foremost, and you just didn't see people running down the corridors without a damn good reason. {&1310}\par Everyone and everything was smart. Orderly. Controlled. Just like the Grand Admirals liked it. Just like Dad liked it.{&1310}\par Everyone and everything in their proper place at the appropriate time. Everyone and everything, that is, except ... me -- apparently.{&1310}\par "Please do not obstruct this unit or its faculties."{&1310}\par I snapped back to a custodial unit popping out of the door behind. It pinged me with that deadpan voice. I must have stood there too long. Warning yellow lights flashed on top of its squared head -- as close to yelling at me for loitering there as it could possibly get.{&1310}\par "Shut up," I told it. But I still pushed off out of its way.{&1310}\par All of those things had monitoring feeds and reported suspicious behavior back to station security, as me and Tess had found out all too long ago. Every bulkhead, every door -- probably every \i person \i0 too. All recording sensory data all the time and it was all controlled and accessible by the Watchmen. That was why they called them that. Well, that and for the name of the station. They were "watching" all the time, keeping things tidy and clean and under control for whatever Grand Admiral happened to be paying attention to his or her pet research projects for the time being. It was easy to forget that after living there for so long. And it wasn't like being at the Academy was so different.{&1310}\par I didn't need any unwanted attention from a janitor bot either.{&1310}\par So I trudged back to the main thoroughfare. I hadn't had any destination in mind other than "away" when I'd first started running. I was pretty sure Mills had stopped following me after those first few minutes, when he seemed like he was trying to chase me down or something. Now I managed to keep myself calm enough to walk my way all the way to the other side of the station, back to my quarters, without losing it again or anything. It helped that I was trying not to think about Dad while I did. A little. But it was hard. It was really, really hard.{&1310}\par By the time I got to the little block of cells where my room was, there was no one really left out and about in sight. Just one very drunk marine propping himself up against a bulkhead near the junction at the end of the corridor. I brought up my wrist comm and buzzed Tess from outside my front door.{&1310}\par "Where are you?" I asked as soon as that tiny holo of her appeared to answer. It was much more harshly than I meant to.{&1310}\par "Uhhh, working?"{&1310}\par "Can you ..." I started, and then stopped, and bit my lip. I realized I didn't know what I wanted. To be alone? That's what I had thought on the way back before I called up Tess on reflex. It was reflex. Subconscious. I guess I \i didn't\i0  really want to be alone right now.{&1310}\par She was busy, so I thought about going to see her at Bertram's ... but I didn't exactly want to walk into a room full of strangers getting drunk at the moment. Other people did when they felt like I did -- I'd seen and overheard so many things while hanging out there with Tess late at night that it should've been easy to fit in. But I didn't want to be one of them.{&1310}\par I shook my head.{&1310}\par "Nevermind," I told her quickly. "Forget it."{&1310}\par "Ev, wha-"{&1310}\par I cut the holo off before she could finish, and part of me felt even worse for a second about that. That part of me that knew I had probably just ruined her night with wondering what the hell was wrong with me and had made me call up only to hang up. Hopefully, she'd forget it like I told her to. Hopefully, she'd move on and just see me again tomorrow after I'd had some time to work through it alone.{&1310}\par Hopefully.{&1310}\par Probably not.{&1310}\par My door slid open and I stepped inside my little quarters, growling pitifully at what I'd just done to Tess as well as how red and swollen my eyes must have looked. Another reason I wouldn't have dared go. I just covered up with my palms and stood there instead, taking deep breaths in and out in the dark for a minute and feeling sorry for myself. At least no one would have to see me again tonight.{&1310}\par Then I felt ... something.{&1310}\par My hands dropped away from my face instantly. The room was dark and, for a moment, I was suddenly too scared to command the lights on. Or even say anything at all. I immediately recognized that feeling a split second later for what it was. The room wasn't empty. Muscle memory from years of living there and I could feel the subtle difference in air flow. {&1310}\par I don't know why I didn't call out, but it was lucky that I hadn't. That first "hello?" was always the beginning of the end for some dumb extra in the vids, and it probably would've been mine. I dropped down low toward the deck instead.{&1310}\par I didn't know why I did \i that\i0  either. Too many months watching pulse rifles blast at cadets' faceplates, probably, and getting enough stunbolt shots to my face as well. But a second later, and I was lucky that I had.{&1310}\par Something flashed over me. I felt the air rush, hissing faintly in my ears. I swear it was just an inch over where my head had been. I wasn't hit, but whoever it was inside my room didn't know that. My first instinct was to run, but I froze up instead. That second stretched on too long and I did the only other thing I could think to do. I let myself collapse down to the floor in a heap. {&1310}\par And that must have been what whoever it was had been waiting for because the lights flashed on in the next instant.{&1310}\par I only got a split second to see what was going on. Two men, one with a pulse pistol still aimed at where my head had been. It shifted fluidly downward to where I lay on the floor and my eyes squeezed shut. I waited for the follow-up shot to make sure I was down for good.{&1310}\par Why the fuck hadn't I run?!?{&1310}\par "Check her," one of them said. I think it was that one with his gun pointed at me. I couldn't remember if the other one had had a gun too -- all I'd seen was his one hand on the manual switch for the lights. He must have been the one coming around my bed toward me on the floor.{&1310}\par I had to let myself go as limp as possible. It was hard. Blood was pumping in my ears so loudly I was sure they'd hear it, and my stupid brain was in a panicked frenzy trying to figure out what they were doing there and what was going on that involved me getting shot in the head inside my own room.{&1310}\par How had they even gotten guns in here? Only the Watchmen and some marine details were even \i allowed\i0  to carry weapons. And I was pretty damn sure some alarms should have been going off at that live discharge inside the station!{&1310}\par Was it supposed to kill me? I didn't breathe. But that guy would know real quick that I wasn't dead as soon as he got close enough to see.{&1310}\par I had this image in my head of him yelling that I was still alive a split second after checking my pulse, and me with my eyes popping open in terror only to be gunned down helplessly there on the floor. Some tragically quick and sloppy end for the hero ...{&1310}\par Except heroes didn't die. They never died. \i People \i0 did.{&1310}\par His fingers touched my wrist and then my neck. They stayed limp no matter how much I wanted to tense up, ready for that next shot. But he just grunted, "She's out," and stood back up.{&1310}\par I'd completely forgotten the convenient lack of charge burns on my face that would have tipped them off instantly if the shot had been meant to kill. They must have been using stunners ... \i Why\i0 ?{&1310}\par \i Does it matter?\i0 {&1310}\par  I tried to keep a spatial awareness of what they were doing. The one who hadn't shot me was moving over to the door -- confirmed by it opening. He didn't leave, though. I imagined him sticking his head out to see if the coast was clear. It probably still was.{&1310}\par Why weren't the alarms going off?{&1310}\par Oh god, don't tell me there weren't really any after all!{&1310}\par No one was going to save me.{&1310}\par \i Shut up\i0 ! I tried to yell at myself.{&1310}\par Calm down.{&1310}\par There were security measures all over the place. Armed Watchmen, officers, and marines on duty. Strict docking and undocking protocols to follow. Cargo inventory checks. They couldn't just take me anywhere without tipping \i someone\i0  off, right? They'd have had an easier time of just killing me before they inevitably got caught.{&1310}\par That was ...{&1310}\par I hoped they didn't realize that.{&1310}\par But they'd gotten in here, though. And with guns. No one had stopped them. And what good was security all over going to do for me if they somehow managed to get out again before anyone even noticed?{&1310}\par No good at all ...{&1310}\par That sinking feeling in my guts made me start to tense up without realizing it. The one who'd shot me was standing over me now. I could feel his eyes, and that only made it worse.{&1310}\par "You said she was out," he said back at the other one. It wasn't a question. And I felt the cosmic weight of that gun shifting toward me like it was some kind of force of nature.{&1310}\par \i Oh shit\i0 .{&1310}\par I kicked out without thinking. Or aiming. Or even knowing where that guy actually was except by what I'd heard and felt. But I guess I got him, because that shot went wide and plasma fizzled into the carpet next to my head. I snapped my eyes open and let my other foot fly -- right on target this time -- and I got him square in the knee.{&1310}\par If he hadn't been wearing what felt like armored plating there, I probably would have smashed it. As it was, he stumbled back, grunting in surprise and trying to catch his balance with my bed and the wall and failing. That gun fell out of his hand.{&1310}\par The other guy spun back around. He did have a gun, but it was a knife he clutched tightly in his hand just then -- a big, wicked looking thing that he rushed at me with. I only got to my knees before he was on top of me with it, stabbing. So I snatched that extended arm by the wrist and elbow and half-pushed, half-pulled it across in front of me, just like he was Komi on the goddamned mat!{&1310}\par Except not Komi. {&1310}\par And with a knife. {&1310}\par And probably meaning to actually kill me.{&1310}\par But it worked.{&1310}\par He stumbled past my right shoulder, slicing open the sleeve, and sprawled into the floor without his balance. I didn't wait to see if he'd drawn blood. I scrambled up over his bulky body and threw myself at the door before either of them could get up again.{&1310}\par "\i Gethergoddamnit\i0 !"{&1310}\par Outside I hit the opposite bulkhead, adrenaline pumping so strong I barely felt it. I pushed away and charged down the empty corridor back towards the thoroughfare and people. There would be two more turns and then I'd be out in the open. I ran. I ran faster than I ever had in PT. I ran like Lieutenant Morisant himself was right there behind me egging me on.{&1310}\par And the whole time I just waited for that pulse blast to hit me in the back.{&1310}\par Footsteps chased after me, but that was it. Heavy, and desperate. He was taller than me and ate up that ground fast. I don't know why he didn't just shoot me like they'd tried to before, and I almost wish he would have when I pictured that ugly knife coming hurtling at me with all the force of his charging body from behind.{&1310}\par I got to the end of the corridor, but he was on top of me again. There was only one person in sight -- that drunk marine at the other end of the hall. I ducked right and away from the turn instead of left, and the guy with the knife flew into the bulkhead instead of me. "HELP!" I screamed at that drunk man, now staring bleary-eyed and uncomprehending at me. "I NEED HELP!"{&1310}\par I jumped over the knife guy trying to get back up and kept screaming at the top of my lungs while I pawed at my wrist comm to quick-call Tess, Dad -- \i anyone\i0 ! Bertram came up first for some reason. I just punched it.{&1310}\par Alphabetical. Right. Duh.{&1310}\par \i Who cares?!?\i0 {&1310}\par "Bertram pick up!" I screamed impatiently while it tried to go through.{&1310}\par Then my feet flew out from under me.{&1310}\par My legs were snatched back so hard and fast that I went face-first into the deck. I didn't even realize it until I woke up a couple seconds later. There was the salty-sweet taste of blood in my mouth and my whole head was throbbing, especially the left side. I tried to blink it away. Pain shot through that whole part of my face instead.{&1310}\par The knife guy was stalking past me. I froze and watched as he trudged right up to that drunk marine without a single word and slammed the other man's head right into the bulkhead. I heard the crunch. I gaped, sucking in ragged breaths on the floor, and watched the marine crumple like so much dead meat. {&1310}\par That guy had killed him like he was nothing. Just for \i being \i0 there.{&1310}\par Then he was coming back for me.{&1310}\par I tried to get back up, but nothing was working right. My legs wouldn't move. I panicked, but looked down at them and saw the wire. It was wrapped tight around both my shins with two counterweights, squeezing them together. I fumbled to untie them and felt a boot slam into my back.{&1310}\par I might have blacked out again. I don't know. I couldn't breath for so long I was sure I'd die too. Something grabbed my wrist and I blinked, looking that way to see the knife guy rear back and slam his fist into the comm.{&1310}\par Pain exploded in my arm and I screamed. Or tried to. All that came out was a hoarse squeak. It felt like he'd punched my wrist into pieces. I stared at my fingers as I tried to flex them and they moved, but not without screaming back at me.{&1310}\par That guy with the knife had picked up the weights on my legs and started dragging me back the way we'd come.

I don't know why he didn't just shoot me like they'd tried to before, and I almost wish he would have when I pictured that ugly knife coming hurtling at me with all the force of his charging body from behind.{&1310}\par I got to the end of the corridor, but he was on top of me again. There was only one person in sight -- that drunk marine at the other end of the hall. I ducked right and away from the turn instead of left, and the guy with the knife flew into the bulkhead instead of me. "HELP!" I screamed at that drunk man, now staring bleary-eyed and uncomprehending at me. "I NEED HELP!"{&1310}\par I jumped over the knife guy trying to get back up and kept screaming at the top of my lungs while I pawed at my wrist comm to quick-call Tess, Dad -- \i anyone\i0 ! Bertram came up first for some reason. I just punched it.{&1310}\par Alphabetical. Right. Duh.{&1310}\par \i Who cares?!?\i0 {&1310}\par "Bertram pick up!" I screamed impatiently while it tried to go through.{&1310}\par Then my feet flew out from under me.{&1310}\par My legs were snatched back so hard and fast that I went face-first into the deck. I didn't even realize it until I woke up a couple seconds later. There was the salty-sweet taste of blood in my mouth and my whole head was throbbing, especially the left side. I tried to blink it away. Pain shot through that whole part of my face instead.{&1310}\par The knife guy was stalking past me. I froze and watched as he trudged right up to that drunk marine without a single word and slammed the other man's head right into the bulkhead. I heard the crunch. I gaped, sucking in ragged breaths on the floor, and watched the marine crumple like so much dead meat. {&1310}\par That guy had killed him like he was nothing. Just for \i being \i0 there.{&1310}\par Then he was coming back for me.{&1310}\par I tried to get back up, but nothing was working right. My legs wouldn't move. I panicked, but looked down at them and saw the wire. It was wrapped tight around both my shins with two counterweights, squeezing them together. I fumbled to untie them and felt a boot slam into my back.{&1310}\par I might have blacked out again. I don't know. I couldn't breath for so long I was sure I'd die too. Something grabbed my wrist and I blinked, looking that way to see the knife guy rear back and slam his fist into the comm.{&1310}\par Pain exploded in my arm and I screamed. Or tried to. All that came out was a hoarse squeak. It felt like he'd punched my wrist into pieces. I stared at my fingers as I tried to flex them and they moved, but not without screaming back at me.{&1310}\par That guy with the knife had picked up the weights on my legs and started dragging me back the way we'd come. My face scraped the floor.{&1310}\par Bulkheads with too-bright overhead lights floated past. They didn't shield them in this part of the station. Not like where people like Dad stayed. I reached my good hand lazily out to grab something but just ended up getting both arms trailing roughly along the deck behind me. It felt dirty like it hadn't seen a maintenance bot in days. It probably hadn't.{&1310}\par The gunman was standing against the door of my room when we rounded the corner. He had one hand on the bulkhead and another on his knee. The one I'd all but kicked in. At least there was that much. He grunted into his wrist as we got close.{&1310}\par "We got her."\cf2\f1 {&1310}\par }{&1310}
