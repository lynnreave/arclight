I glared out the window, confused, for a few seconds. Then I glanced back at the old man.{&1310}\par "Are those, uh, farms?" I stuck a finger toward the sprawling, plowed-looking fields out to either side of us as we drove.{&1310}\par "Sure are, young lady," he gave me another wink. {&1310}\par How long had I been passed out? I hated to think of having to run all that way on foot. So I didn't. {&1310}\par "You all on your way to Dreggoran and the Door?"{&1310}\par That confused me for a second. Everything kind of did, despite the few naps I'd had. I nodded, as much because I didn't care as I didn't know. Maybe that's where old Weir and Ev had been headed. That message I'd read in his private comm box hadn't said much about it. But ...{&1310}\par "Where are we?"{&1310}\par I rounded on the old man again, even though he'd been chattering on about something else again. I hadn't heard a word of it.{&1310}\par He frowned, interrupting whatever thought he had been chewing on with his pipe out loud. "You don't know?" he asked, surprised. But then he just shrugged it off, and gave a little wave of his hand inside that cramped cabin.{&1310}\par "Most of the out of town folks go by the name of the port - Lyricum." He smiled at me around that pipe, and flipped the red cap on his head with his free hand real quick. "Where were going is the little town of Armin, though. Just a quiet little stop near the Nickel mines on the way to the port."{&1310}\par He rattled on some more. For my part, I settled back in my seat, trying to remember everything from that message to old Weir. Something about Lyricum, I remembered. I thought there might have been something about some people staying there that were supposed to know him. I wouldn't think the transport cruiser would have stopped at a little place like that, but I hadn't been much interested in that bit anyways. Whoever sent the thing sounded like a friend. He only signed with his initials, anyways.{&1310}\par "You'll probably be wanting to head on out toward the big, old port then," he continued agreeably with another flounce of his hat and reading the unconscious Eluvian's mind, "I'd imagine. No other way to get out toward the Door."{&1310}\par Again, I nodded, staring out at those fields now. If I kept looking too hard, everything would just sort of blur out of focus and I'd catch my head drooping. I fought it off for a bit. I don't know why.{&1310}\par And the next time I woke up it was because the old man was shaking my shoulder. My eyes snapped back open, but this time I had a headache. I grabbed at my forehead with one hand, giving him a dirty look.{&1310}\par "We're here, young lady," was all he said. Then I looked up and around, and we were suddenly in some kind of dirty little town.{&1310}\par "Where the hell are we?" I asked, fighting back that throbbing in my skull. Jules was outside my hatch, though, walking away. The moment I saw that, I jerked forward, threw it open, and shouted out.{&1310}\par "Hey! Where are you going?"{&1310}\par He barely gave me more than a backward glance, striding like he hadn't collapsed on top of himself not too long ago. I got a good look at all those planetside buildings thrusting up from the ground into the sky without a care for bulkheads or running out of space in that airy emptiness, as I hurried over to pull Ev out when the Eluvian man didn't even stop. She was still staring.{&1310}\par "Damnit!" I snapped over my shoulder. "WAIT FOR US!"{&1310}\par Before I could run off, though, I remembered the old man, and rounded back on him. I ducked down inside where he was waiting with a patient look on his face.{&1310}\par "Thanks!" I uttered at him with a flash of a smile I didn't feel between my mood and my sudden headache. He smiled back, and leaned forward into the steering wheel.{&1310}\par "Don't mention it. Theresa was it? Just doin' my part." He puffed out his beard and mustaches, swiping at that pipe. "You do old Anders a favor, you hear?" He stuck it out at me. "You take care of that friend of yours."{&1310}\par I just groaned inwardly after I pulled back out, watching him drive off into that town. When had I told him \i that\i0 ? No one ever called me that. Why the hell would I tell him? I must have \i really\i0  been out of it.{&1310}\par The Eluvian man was almost out of sight, marching away into the white-washed buildings. He stood out really bad, though, and people gave him a wide berth. I guess we looked a bit out of place there too. It didn't help that we were all covered in old blood and Ev was like a corpse on her feet.{&1310}\par "Come on," I growled in Ev's ear, taking her arm in one hand. She didn't say a single thing - just kept staring off into space with those tears in her eyes. And I had to drag her to get her moving at all. {&1310}\par \pard\fi720\sl480\slmult1 I groaned out loud, and hurried after Jules.\cf2\f2 {&1310}\par }{&1310}
