They were bulky pistols with more controls than I'd ever seen before in my life. One of them pinned Richter to the wall, pushing his gun up under the man's throat. The other was turning around the apartment.{&1310}\par \pard\fi720\sl480\slmult1\highlight0 "Stay with him," the one moving hissed. His cold, serpentine eyes snapped across the bathroom and I squeezed myself back against the wall and out of sight.{&1310}\par "And just when did you get that, Officer?" the one holding him demanded rhetorically about the bloody jacket in Richter's ear, giving a shove into his windpipe with that firebolt for good measure. "I \i don't\i0  think it fits you ..."{&1310}\par The other one had his pistol pointed toward the bathroom and me. If I'd hoped he might somehow not find us, I was wrong. A light cut through the open doorway into the smaller, dark room.{&1310}\par "Come out of there," he ordered firmly. Like how one of the Watchmen after catching us in the middle of something might back home. Except much, much worse. "Now."{&1310}\par I glanced at Tess, breath stuck in my throat. She shook her head quickly. Her face had gone pale in the dark.{&1310}\par "There's ... no one here!" Richter managed from the other room, and I heard a \i fwap!\i0  before him hitting the ground with a grunt.{&1310}\par "Shut your mouth, officer."{&1310}\par "Come out or I'll shoot him."{&1310}\par There was the telltale sing of a firebolt round being charged, and I imagined it pointed right at Richter's head.{&1310}\par "Then I'll come in there and shoot \i you\i0 ."{&1310}\par I squeezed myself back against the wall as tight as I would go. I didn't know what to do. I didn't know what to do! I screamed inside my head, and squeezed my eyes shut too, hoping it all might just go away. Not that I fooled myself for more than a fraction of a second. And then icy dread was pouring down my back and suffusing every part of me so that I couldn't move.{&1310}\par Someone moved in front of me, and I gasped. My eyes flew open, but it was Tess. She stuck a finger to her lips, green eyes boring into mine in the dark. I stared at her, uncomprehending. The man outside was counting.{&1310}\par "Two."{&1310}\par I hadn't heard him start.{&1310}\par Tess stuck a hand out into the open doorway before I could do anything or even figure out why she was standing in front of me. That man out there saw it. And it happened so fast, I half-expected it to get melted right off to blinding fire as she did. I waited against it, eyes wide and horrified.{&1310}\par "Okay. The rest of you."{&1310}\par "What are you doing?" I hissed at her so quietly she couldn't have even heard me. I tried to grab her arm back, but she pushed me away with a strength that I couldn't have even mustered just then for the life of me. My head started spinning with flashes of that firebolt blasting away pieces of her as she crept them slowly out into view. My body started shaking on its own while I stood there helpless and hiding in the dark, jsut thinking about it.{&1310}\par \pard\fi720\sl480\slmult1 I tried to look up at the man, but all I could see was that gun pointed at my chest. It felt like gravity would suck that shot right out of the barrel and punch it through me if he didn't. And I waited for him too, holding both my hands up so he could see I didn't have any weapons to worry about.\cf2\highlight0\f1 {&1310}\par }{&1310}
