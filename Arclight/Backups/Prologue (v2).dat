Rancid water crashed down from my face, plastered black with slime, sludge, and the grime oozing along my scalp. It gasped out loud like some half-drowned corpse, gagging on the thick air. There was too much of it, and not enough. Every part of me just shook with the shock of that sudden life.{&1310}\par Still. Alive.{&1310}\par The man who had snatched my head back out of the water, let me go. He pulled his hand back from the slimy, ragged mass of my tangled hair, smearing it against the side of his dirty coat with a wince. I pitched forward back toward the murky water, but caught myself just before falling in again.{&1310}\par "What the hell is it, Brennan?"{&1310}\par Someone was edging up behind us. But the man ignored that harsh whisper for a moment, not saying anything just yet. I was busy choking on my lungs there in the grass and reeds. I could barely anything out in that dark - it was so thick and new. I ignored him too.{&1310}\par The second man growled loudly in his throat, and started sloshing his way toward the one who had pulled me back - Brennan - in the shallows of the water. He opened his mouth to say something more. Then caught himself up.{&1310}\par "God, is that ...?" he trailed off, almost too quiet to hear.\cf2\f1 {&1310}\par }{&1310}
