I jolted back awake at the touch.{&1310}\par Fingers on my arm. I snatched back my hand, and twisted that way with a gasp. A figure hunched down beside me, face hidden under a hood. It stank, and it was mumbling something that made my skin crawl. It looked like it had just clawed its way out of the garbage.{&1310}\par I must have been loud, because I felt dad beside me a moment later. He just stood there, but that hooded figure turned around and scampered off without another thought. I glanced up at him, and he down at me. Then he turned back away. His face was as hard as ever.{&1310}\par "If you want to see Riftwatch before we leave for good," he told me, now over near a porthole in the wall behind, "then you had better come look now."{&1310}\par I spun around in surprise, but I wasn't in the access tunnels anymore. It was a big cabin, simple benches and chairs scattered all around. People were everywhere. A few looked like the one I woke up to. Most were quiet. But it was loud in there all the same, and I didn't recognize any of them.{&1310}\par I couldn't remember what happened after the flames in the tunnels. I tried. I guess I had found dad, though, so it didn't matter that much. I had made it. I just had no idea where I had made it to.{&1310}\par "Evelyn."{&1310}\par I pushed myself up at the sound of his voice, harsher this time. He glanced back from the porthole - none of the ones on Riftwatch I had seen were ever that crude and dirty. Except maybe down where nobody really went. I don't know. But dad was waiting there for me.{&1310}\par My body was a little stiff, and bruised in a few places. I remembered the two men in the tunnels tossing me around with the Voidtongue. And I wondered what dad might have done to them while I hobbled over toward the window. When I got there, he pulled back so I could see.{&1310}\par "There," he pointed. But I didn't need him too. There was only one thing to look at other than the Rift, glimmering and flourescent in the depths of space. The station - Riftwatch ... Home. It was small enough now to fit in that dingy little porthole.{&1310}\par We had left.{&1310}\par We had already left.{&1310}\par No more Warden. No more Watchmen or Elle. No more Bertram or Ressler or even Sergeant Macome.{&1310}\par No more Tess ...{&1310}\par Somehow, I was sitting again. I didn't get to see Riftwatch fade away out of sight. I'm not sure if I cared about that. I had thought there would be goodbyes and a last moment before getting on that shuttle. But, nothing. We were just suddenly here.{&1310}\par Except here wasn't on a shuttle. I looked around again, and that much was obvious. I even caught a glimpse of that one figure skulking about the edges of the room, still mumbling to himself. And I glanced back toward dad.{&1310}\par "What happened?" I finally asked.{&1310}\par He didn't take his eyes away from the porthole, staring out into space. And, when he eventually did answer me, I couldn't help but wonder if it was even worth the trouble of (him{&47}me) opening (his{&47}my) mouth.{&1310}\par "Events that I had not foreseen."{&1310}\par "What?"{&1310}\par Maybe it was my fault. If I wasn't smart enough to figure it out, then he wasn't going to tell me. That was usually the way things went. Just because we weren't in Riftwatch anymore didn't mean everything was going to change.{&1310}\par So I tried something different.{&1310}\par "Where are we?"{&1310}\par The answer this time, was a bit more forthcoming. But not by much.{&1310}\par "On our way to someplace safer."{&1310}\par I eyed the crowd in there again. It was a ship of some sort. Below the main decks, I would guess. Not much safer than Riftwatch, though. I don't know if he really noticed. But that was when I noticed something. A \i missing\i0  something. Precisely, \i three\i0  missing somethings.{&1310}\par My bags! They were gone.{&1310}\par I tore all around me in a frenzy. There was \i noooo\i0  way I had just lost them like that after all the running around on the station. Not after everything I'd been through today.{&1310}\par I found the backpack I had been wearing - propped up like a bad pillow on the bench I woke up on - and snagged that lifeline. Dad noticed my frantic searching with a calm eye from where he stood. My eyes flashed up at him in an instant.{&1310}\par "Where are my things?"{&1310}\par "I left the rest behind," he explained, as cool as could be. He wasn't talking about his own stuff being thrown away back on the station.{&1310}\par "W\i hat\i0 ?"{&1310}\par "It was too much, Evelyn," he continued in that infuriatingly placid tone. "We have to move quickly." Maybe I was still just a little in shock.{&1310}\par All my things ... \i Gone\i0  ...{&1310}\par And he acted like it was the least important thing in the universe just then. I ... I think I was going to scream at him.{&1310}\par I almost did. That was when he rounded on me abruptly, though. The look on his face was so suddenly deadpan that I choked on the sound in my throat instantly.{&1310}\par "What?" I ventured anxiously when he said nothing, just stared back into the room. I twisted my head around to get a good look, but there was nothing more interesting going on there. I was still left wondering why we were down there looking like dirty refugees instead of up on what must have been one of the much nicer decks. Dad was pretty important back on Riftwatch.{&1310}\par He just laid a hand down on my shoulder, though. It clawed me right through my jacket.{&1310}\par "Get up. We need to move."{&1310}\par I opened my mouth to say something, but that look he had was more than a little unnerving. So I did the only thing I could do. I grabbed my \i one\i0  bag, and stood again.{&1310}\par "Okay ..."{&1310}\par "Come on." He snatched my arm in an icy grip before I had even gotten the pack slipped back on, and dragged me hurriedly away.{&1310}\par We had to climb over a bunch of those poor people to get to the other side of the cabin. They barely seemed to notice. A lot of coughing, low whispers, and a few children crying. I think it was one of the dirtiest places I had ever been. Ever. And dad just pulled my right on through it as if it were nothing.{&1310}\par "Uh ..."{&1310}\par He hit the doors to some other room, and yanked me through with one last look behind for good measure. We were in some kind of hallway then. And I guess we weren't supposed to be there, because there was a uniformed man with a heavy shock-stick that came at us with an angry look.{&1310}\par "No one's allowed out of the aft lounge during transit," he started to say. By his tone, I guess he was pretty used to dealing with the kinds of people stuffed together back in the cabin. But dad didn't give him a chance to do much else.{&1310}\par My ears twitched as he swung a hand up. The Voidtongue again. This time, it threw the guard over into the wall, out cold without another word. He slumped down to the deck on his side. And I just stared, wide-eyed, at the man on the ground.{&1310}\par "What did you do \i that\i0  for?" I almost shrieked at him in surprise.{&1310}\par "Keep moving," was all dad said, not bothering to answer. Or wait for me to pick up again. He just snatched my hand back, hauling me along again down the hall. I twisted around, eying the guard's body as we stalked away, leaving him quickly behind.{&1310}\par Dad gave a few more guards that got in the way his violent sleep treatment as we made our way through the bowels of the ship up toward what must have been the upper decks. I didn't know where he was going, or why. And he could barely stop long enough to make sure he was going the way he meant to, let alone to explain any of that mess to me. I tried to keep up with him the best I could. {&1310}\par It was hard not to get a little worried at the way he was carrying on. A few glimpses of his deceptively serene face told me enough. A cold sweat glimmered at the sides. Maybe he hid it from me more than himself, but I could tell. He was scared. And that started to absolute terrify me.{&1310}\par I was a nervous wreck too by the time we got upstairs. And I nearly jumped out of my skin when we abruptly came up short at the site of hooded figure from before standing alone in the next corridor.{&1310}\par Dad let me go, and pushed me back behind him. I noticed what he must have instantly, a moment later. The few guards that littered the floor ahead weren't his work. They had throats cut and stomachs sliced open, already bled out onto the deck. Already dead. And that hooded figure stood in the middle of them.{&1310}\par How did he get ahead of us?{&1310}\par I didn't have long to wonder at that, though. Footsteps clambered down the stairwell behind us, and I twisted around. Another, smaller dark figure was coming up after us from down there, with two of the biggest and ugliest looking monsters I had ever seen to either side. Huge, yellowed fangs poked out from lumpy faces, both hunkering down to keep their tufted heads underneath the ceiling. They took up the entire stairway.{&1310}\par Dad lifted a hand, lips moving quickly. Those three down below stopped at the gesture like they knew what it meant. And he held them there for a moment, eyes darting back and forth between them and the lone man standing ahead. I just stood there, still as stone and wondering what the hell was going on. I wasn't quite brave enough to ask it, though.{&1310}\par "You know why I'm here," the man down the corridor uttered then. His voice was low, and rich. He was big beneath his rags too, and I caught a glint of steel when I looked. For a moment, I could feel the eyes beneath his hood on me. And my skin crawled (so bad{&47}until) I was sure it would slide right off the bone. But he wasn't talking to me.{&1310}\par "Hand over the girl," was all he said. To dad. I glanced back down toward the three below, the brutish monsters inching closer when they thought dad wasn't paying enough attention. The third, a woman, held her ground for now.{&1310}\par And that was when I suddenly realized just who he meant for dad to hand over.{&1310}\par "\i What\i0 ?" {&1310}\par I did shriek at him this time. I looked from the man to the woman and the two monsters, and tried to squeeze myself even further away against the wall behind dad. The woman below was eying me like she meant to disect my insides, and those two brutes just looked hungry. The hooded man didn't pay me any more notice, but that hate seething in the air was so thick I could almost taste it.{&1310}\par Dad stuck his other hand up in my face to silence me. For once, I couldn't even argue.{&1310}\par "You're a fool if you think I would ever do so willingly," he said right back at the hooded man. The tone of his voice was new. Dangerous. I had never heard him talk like that before. To anyone. "Step aside. \i Now\i0 ."{&1310}\par I would have. Oh god, but I would have if he had been talking to me just then, and I scrunched even deeper against the wall. But he wasn't. And the other man didn't seem to care.{&1310}\par "I am sorry that you feel that way ... old man."{&1310}\par The way he said it was slow. Threatening. {&1310}\par Something moved underneath his rags.{&1310}\par And so did dad.{&1310}\par Light filled the corridor in an instant. Blinding. I felt a hand catch and shove me back into the wall, and I bounced off into the ground with a pitiful thud. Fire and lightning screamed overhead, eating up all other sound until the whole world around was thunder and burning flesh. I clapped both hands over my ears and hugged the deck like there was nothing else. And, for a single moment, there wasn't.{&1310}\par Then I saw dad again.{&1310}\par Nolan Weir's hands were on fire. His face was still smooth, but his eyes blazed (bright{&47}hot) with that murderous inferno. First one way, and then the other - he rounded on the three behind and lobbed a ball of fire down the stairs. It hit one of the brutes. There was a crack like a whip. Then the whole stair went up in flames, chunks of the beast roaring out of it.{&1310}\par The hooded man in rags was next. Dad's other hand leapt up, and lightning flashed. It snapped into those rags, lighting them up. The man tumbled back over into the wall without a sound.{&1310}\par Thunder boomed.{&1310}\par Dad had my arm in his hand then, tearing me back up from the floor.{&1310}\par "Run! Get out of here!" {&1310}\par He shouted at me over the storm. Impossibly, I could already hear the two still remaining below scrambling up the steps again. I stared at him dumbly, wide-eyed and in shock. And he just snatched my dead weight to him, snarling down my neck.{&1310}\par "Get off the ship!"{&1310}\par The one remaining brute was on us. It loomed out of the smoke and flames with its yellow-fanged maw gaping. Dad flicked a wrist without a second thought, sending it spinning over backwards in tiny pieces and away. I think I started to choke.{&1310}\par He hauled me up again, and shoved me headlong ahead into the corridor. I stumbled wildly past the man in rags, leaden limbs flailing, and hit the deck again at the other end. And I sat there for a long moment, gagging on rent flesh, coppery blood, and the impossibility of it all. {&1310}\par Dad caught me up behind.{&1310}\par "Evelyn! Run!" he shouted again, and I twisted back around. This time, though, it was to freeze up as that hooded man came up behind dad. A long, wicked black blade dangled in one hand beneath those rags. And as the old man looked at me with his angrily pleading eyes, that other grabbed him by the shoulder and stuck him through.{&1310}\par I don't know how, but I was running after that. And the last thing I saw of dad was that hooded figure standing over him with his black sword before everything (dissolved into tears{&47}just fell apart around me).\cf2\f1\fs20 {&1310}\par }{&1310}

I jolted back awake at the touch.{&1310}\par Fingers on my arm. I snatched back my hand, and twisted that way with a gasp. A figure hunched down beside me, face hidden under a hood. It stank, and it was mumbling something that made my skin crawl. It looked like it had just crawled out of the garbage.{&1310}\par I must have been loud, because I felt dad beside me a moment later. He just stood there, but that hooded figure turned around and scampered off without another thought. I glanced up at him, and he down at me. Then he turned back away. His face was as hard as ever.{&1310}\par "If you want to see Riftwatch before we leave for good," he told me, now over near a porthole in the wall behind, "then you had better come look now."{&1310}\par I spun around in surprise, but I wasn't in the access tunnels anymore. It was a big cabin, simple benches and chairs scattered all around everywhere there was space. People were everywhere. A few looked like the one I woke up to. Most were quiet. But it was loud in there all the same, and I didn't recognize any of them.{&1310}\par I couldn't remember what happened after the flames in the tunnels. I tried. I guess I had found dad, though, so it didn't matter that much. I had made it. I just had no idea where I had made it to.{&1310}\par "Evelyn."{&1310}\par I pushed myself up at the sound of his voice, harsher this time. He glanced back from the porthole - none of the ones on Riftwatch I had seen were ever that crude and dirty. Except maybe down where nobody really went. I don't know. But dad was waiting there for me.{&1310}\par My body was a little stiff, and bruised in a few places. I remembered the two men in the tunnels tossing me around with the Voidtongue. And I wondered what dad might have done to them while I hobbled over toward the window. When I got there, he pulled back so I could see.{&1310}\par "There," he pointed. But I didn't need him too. There was only one thing to look at other than the Rift, glimmering and flourescent in the deep of space. The station - Riftwatch ... Home. It was small enough now to fit in that dingy little porthole.{&1310}\par We had left.{&1310}\par We had already left.{&1310}\par No more Warden. No more Watchmen or Elle. No more Bertram or Ressler or even Sergeant Macome.{&1310}\par No more Tess ...{&1310}\par Somehow, I was sitting again. I didn't get to see Riftwatch fade away out of sight. I'm not sure if I cared about that. I had thought there would be goodbyes and a last moment before getting on that shuttle. But, nothing. We were just suddenly here.{&1310}\par Except here wasn't on a shuttle. I looked around again, and that much was obvious. I even caught a glimpse of that one figure skulking about the edges of the room, still mumbling to himself. And I glanced back toward dad.{&1310}\par "What happened?" I finally asked.{&1310}\par He didn't take his eyes away from the porthole, staring out into space. And, when he eventually did answer me, I couldn't help but wonder if it was even worth the trouble of (him{&47}me) opening (his{&47}my) mouth.{&1310}\par "Events that I had not foreseen."{&1310}\par "What?"{&1310}\par Maybe it was my fault. If I wasn't smart enough to figure it out, then he wasn't going to tell me. That was usually the way things went. Just because we weren't in Riftwatch anymore didn't mean everything was going to change.{&1310}\par So I tried something different.{&1310}\par "Where are we?"{&1310}\par The answer this time, was a bit more forthcoming. But not by much.{&1310}\par "On our way to someplace safer."{&1310}\par I eyed the crowd in there again. It was a ship fo some sort. Below the main decks, I would guess. Not much safer than Riftwatch, though. I don't know if he really noticed. But that was when I noticed something. A \i missing\i0  something. Precisely, \i three\i0  missing somethings.{&1310}\par My bags! They were gone.{&1310}\par I tore all around me in a frenzy. There was \i noooo\i0  way I had just lost them like that after all the running around on the station. Not after everything I'd been through today.{&1310}\par I found the backpack I had been wearing - propped up like a bad pillow on the bench I woke up on - and snagged that lifeline. Dad noticed my frantic searching with a calm eye from where he stood. My eyes flashed up at him in an instant.{&1310}\par "Where are my things?"{&1310}\par "I left the rest behind," he explained, as cool as could be. He wasn't talking about his own stuff being thrown away back on the station.{&1310}\par "W\i hat\i0 ?"{&1310}\par "It was too much, Evelyn," he continued in that infuriatingly placid tone. "We have to move quickly." Maybe I was still just a little in shock.{&1310}\par All my things ... \i Gone\i0  ...{&1310}\par And he acted like it was the least important thing in the universe just then. I ... I think I was going to scream at him.{&1310}\par I almost did. That was when he rounded on me abruptly, though. The look on his face was so suddenly deadpan that I choked on the sound in my throat instantly.{&1310}\par "What?" I ventured anxiously when he said nothing, just stared back into the room. I twisted my head around to get a good look, but there was nothing more interesting going on there. I was still left wondering why we were down there looking like dirty refugees instead of up on what must have been one of the much nicer decks. Dad was pretty important back on Riftwatch.{&1310}\par He just laid a hand down on my shoulder, though. It clawed me right through my jacket.{&1310}\par "Get up. We need to move."{&1310}\par I opened my mouth to say something, but that look he had was more than a little unnerving. So I did the only thing I could do. I grabbed my \i one\i0  bag, and stood again.{&1310}\par "Okay ..."{&1310}\par "Come on." He snatched my arm in an icy grip before I had even gotten the pack slipped back on, and dragged me hurriedly away.{&1310}\par We had to climb over a bunch of those poor people to get to the other side of the cabin. They barely seemed to notice. A lot of coughing, low whispers, and a few children crying. I think it was one of the dirtiest places I had ever been. Ever. And dad just pulled my right on through it as if it were nothing.{&1310}\par "Uh ..."{&1310}\par He hit the doors to some other room, and yanked me through with one last look behind for good measure. We were in some kind of hallway then. And I guess we weren't supposed to be there, because there was a uniformed man with a heavy shock-stick that came at us with an angry look.{&1310}\par "No one's allowed out of the aft lounge during transit," he started to say. By his tone, I guess he was pretty used to dealing with the kinds of people stuffed together back in the cabin. But dad didn't give him a chance to do much else.{&1310}\par My ears twitched as he swung a hand up. The Voidtongue again. This time, it threw the guard over into the wall, out cold without another word. He slumped down to the deck on his side. And I just stared, wide-eyed, at the man on the ground.{&1310}\par "What did you do \i that\i0  for?" I almost shrieked at him in surprise.{&1310}\par "Keep moving," was all dad said, not bothering to answer. Or wait for me to pick up again. He just snatched my hand back, hauling me along again down the hall. I twisted around, eying the guard's body as we stalked away, leaving him quickly behind.{&1310}\par Dad gave a few more guards that got in the way his violent sleep treatment as we made our way through the bowels of the ship up toward what must have been the upper decks. I didn't know where he was going, or why. And he could barely stop long enough to make sure he was going the way he meant to, let alone to explain any of that mess to me. I tried to keep up with him the best I could. {&1310}\par It was hard not to get a little worried at the way he was carrying on. A few glimpses of his deceptively serene face told me enough. A cold sweat glimmered at the sides. Maybe he hid it from me more than himself, but I could tell. He was scared. And that started to absolute terrify me.{&1310}\par I was a nervous wreck too by the time we got upstairs. And I nearly jumped out of my skin when we abruptly came up short at the site of hooded figure from before standing alone in the next corridor.{&1310}\par Dad let me go, and pushed me back behind him. I noticed what he must have instantly, a moment later. The few guards that littered the floor ahead weren't his work. They had throats cut and stomachs sliced open, already bled out onto the deck. Already dead. And that hooded figure stood in the middle of them.{&1310}\par How did he get ahead of us?{&1310}\par I didn't have long to wonder at that, though. Footsteps clambered down the stairwell behind us, and I twisted around. Another, smaller dark figure was coming up after us from down there, with two of the biggest and ugliest looking monsters I had ever seen to either side. Huge, yellowed fangs poked out from lumpy faces, both hunkering down to keep their tufted heads underneath the ceiling. They took up the entire stairway.{&1310}\par Dad lifted a hand, lips moving quickly. Those three down below stopped at the gesture like they knew what it meant. And he held them there for a moment, eyes darting back and forth between them and the lone man standing ahead. I just stood there, still as stone and wondering what the hell was going on. I wasn't quite brave enough to ask it, though.{&1310}\par "You know why I'm here," the man down the corridor uttered then. His voice was low, and rich. He was big beneath his rags too, and I caught a glint of steel when I looked. For a moment, I could feel the eyes beneath his hood on me. And my skin crawled (so bad{&47}until) I was sure it would slide right off the bone. But he wasn't talking to me.{&1310}\par "Hand over the girl," was all he said. To dad. I glanced back down toward the three below, the brutish monsters inching closer when they thought dad wasn't paying enough attention. The third, a woman, held her ground for now.{&1310}\par And that was when I suddenly realized just who he meant for dad to hand over.{&1310}\par "\i What\i0 ?" {&1310}\par I did shriek at him this time. I looked from the man to the woman and the two monsters, and tried to squeeze myself even further away against the wall behind dad. The woman below was eying me like she meant to disect my insides, and those two brutes just looked hungry. The hooded man didn't pay me any more notice, but that hate seething in the air was so thick I could almost taste it.{&1310}\par Dad stuck his other hand up in my face to silence me. For once, I couldn't even argue.{&1310}\par "You're a fool if you think I would ever do so willingly," he said right back at the hooded man. The tone of his voice was new. Dangerous. I had never heard him talk like that before. To anyone. "Step aside. \i Now\i0 ."{&1310}\par I would have. Oh god, but I would have if he had been talking to me just then, and I scrunched even deeper against the wall. But he wasn't. And the other man didn't seem to care.{&1310}\par "I am sorry that you feel that way ... old man."{&1310}\par The way he said it was slow. Threatening. {&1310}\par Something moved underneath his rags.{&1310}\par And so did dad.{&1310}\par Light filled the corridor in an instant. Blinding. I felt a hand catch and shove me back into the wall, and I bounced off into the ground with a pitiful thud. Fire and lightning screamed overhead, eating up all other sound until the whole world around was thunder and burning flesh. I clapped both hands over my ears and hugged the deck like there was nothing else. And, for a single moment, there wasn't.{&1310}\par Then I saw dad again.{&1310}\par Nolan Weir's hands were on fire. His face was still smooth, but his eyes blazed (bright{&47}hot) with that murderous inferno. First one way, and then the other - he rounded on the three behind and lobbed a ball of fire down the stairs. It hit one of the brutes. There was a crack like a whip. Then the whole stair went up in flames, chunks of the beast roaring out of it.{&1310}\par The hooded man in rags was next. Dad's other hand leapt up, and lightning flashed. It snapped into those rags, lighting them up. The man tumbled back over into the wall without a sound.{&1310}\par Thunder boomed.{&1310}\par Dad had my arm in his hand then, tearing me back up from the floor.{&1310}\par "Run! Get out of here!" {&1310}\par He shouted at me over the storm. Impossibly, I could already hear the two still remaining below scrambling up the steps again. I stared at him dumbly, wide-eyed and in shock. And he just snatched my dead weight to him, snarling down my neck.{&1310}\par "Get off the ship!"{&1310}\par The one remaining brute was on us. It loomed out of the smoke and flames with its yellow-fanged maw gaping. Dad flicked a wrist without a second thought, sending it spinning over backwards in tiny pieces and away. I think I started to choke.{&1310}\par He hauled me up again, and shoved me headlong ahead into the corridor. I stumbled wildly past the man in rags, leaden limbs flailing, and hit the deck again at the other end. And I sat there for a long moment, gagging on rent flesh, coppery blood, and the impossibility of it all. {&1310}\par Dad caught me up behind.{&1310}\par "Evelyn! Run!" he shouted again, and I twisted back around. This time, though, it was to freeze up as that hooded man came up behind dad. A long, wicked black blade dangled in one hand beneath those rags. And as the old man looked at me with his angrily pleading eyes, that other grabbed him by the shoulder and stuck him through.{&1310}\par I don't know how, but I was running after that. And the last thing I saw of dad was that hooded figure standing over him with his black sword before everything dissolved into tears.\cf2\f1\fs20 {&1310}\par }{&1310}

I jolted back awake at the touch.{&1310}\par Fingers on my arm. I snatched back my hand, and twisted that way with a gasp. A figure hunched down beside me, face hidden under a hood. It stank, and it was mumbling something that made my skin crawl. It looked like it had just crawled out of the garbage.{&1310}\par I must have been loud, because I felt dad beside me a moment later. He just stood there, but that hooded figure turned around and scampered off without another thought. I glanced up at him, and he down at me. Then he turned back away. His face was as hard as ever.{&1310}\par "If you want to see Riftwatch before we leave for good," he told me, now over near a porthole in the wall behind, "then you had better come look now."{&1310}\par I spun around in surprise, but I wasn't in the access tunnels anymore. It was a big cabin, simple benches and chairs scattered all around everywhere there was space. People were everywhere. A few looked like the one I woke up to. Most were quiet. But it was loud in there all the same, and I didn't recognize any of them.{&1310}\par I couldn't remember what happened after the flames in the tunnels. I tried. I guess I had found dad, though, so it didn't matter that much. I had made it. I just had no idea where I had made it to.{&1310}\par "Evelyn."{&1310}\par I pushed myself up at the sound of his voice, harsher this time. He glanced back from the porthole - none of the ones on Riftwatch I had seen were ever that crude and dirty. Except maybe down where nobody really went. I don't know. But dad was waiting there for me.{&1310}\par My body was a little stiff, and bruised in a few places. I remembered the two men in the tunnels tossing me around with the Voidtongue. And I wondered what dad might have done to them while I hobbled over toward the window. When I got there, he pulled back so I could see.{&1310}\par "There," he pointed. But I didn't need him too. There was only one thing to look at other than the Rift, glimmering and flourescent in the deep of space. The station - Riftwatch ... Home. It was small enough now to fit in that dingy little porthole.{&1310}\par We had left.{&1310}\par We had already left.{&1310}\par No more Warden. No more Watchmen or Elle. No more Bertram or Ressler or even Sergeant Macome.{&1310}\par No more Tess ...{&1310}\par Somehow, I was sitting again. I didn't get to see Riftwatch fade away out of sight. I'm not sure if I cared about that. I had thought there would be goodbyes and a last moment before getting on that shuttle. But, nothing. We were just suddenly here.{&1310}\par Except here wasn't on a shuttle. I looked around again, and that much was obvious. I even caught a glimpse of that one figure skulking about the edges of the room, still mumbling to himself. And I glanced back toward dad.{&1310}\par "What happened?" I finally asked.{&1310}\par He didn't take his eyes away from the porthole, staring out into space. And, when he eventually did answer me, I couldn't help but wonder if it was even worth the trouble of (him{&47}me) opening (his{&47}my) mouth.{&1310}\par "Events that I had not foreseen."{&1310}\par "What?"{&1310}\par Maybe it was my fault. If I wasn't smart enough to figure it out, then he wasn't going to tell me. That was usually the way things went. Just because we weren't in Riftwatch anymore didn't mean everything was going to change.{&1310}\par So I tried something different.{&1310}\par "Where are we?"{&1310}\par The answer this time, was a bit more forthcoming. But not by much.{&1310}\par "On our way to someplace safer."{&1310}\par I eyed the crowd in there again. It was a ship fo some sort. Below the main decks, I would guess. Not much safer than Riftwatch, though. I don't know if he really noticed. But that was when I noticed something. A \i missing\i0  something. Precisely, \i three\i0  missing somethings.{&1310}\par My bags! They were gone.{&1310}\par I tore all around me in a frenzy. There was \i noooo\i0  way I had just lost them like that after all the running around on the station. Not after everything I'd been through today.{&1310}\par I found the backpack I had been wearing - propped up like a bad pillow on the bench I woke up on - and snagged that lifeline. Dad noticed my frantic searching with a calm eye from where he stood. My eyes flashed up at him in an instant.{&1310}\par "Where are my things?"{&1310}\par "I left the rest behind," he explained, as cool as could be. He wasn't talking about his own stuff being thrown away back on the station.{&1310}\par "W\i hat\i0 ?"{&1310}\par "It was too much, Evelyn," he continued in that infuriatingly placid tone. "We have to move quickly." Maybe I was still just a little in shock.{&1310}\par All my things ... \i Gone\i0  ...{&1310}\par And he acted like it was the least important thing in the universe just then. I ... I think I was going to scream at him.{&1310}\par I almost did. That was when he rounded on me abruptly, though. The look on his face was so suddenly deadpan that I choked on the sound in my throat instantly.{&1310}\par "What?" I ventured anxiously when he said nothing, just stared back into the room. I twisted my head around to get a good look, but there was nothing more interesting going on there. I was still left wondering why we were down there looking like dirty refugees instead of up on what must have been one of the much nicer decks. Dad was pretty important back on Riftwatch.{&1310}\par He just laid a hand down on my shoulder, though. It clawed me right through my jacket.{&1310}\par "Get up. We need to move."{&1310}\par I opened my mouth to say something, but that look he had was more than a little unnerving. So I did the only thing I could do. I grabbed my \i one\i0  bag, and stood again.{&1310}\par "Okay ..."{&1310}\par "Come on." He snatched my arm in an icy grip before I had even gotten the pack slipped back on, and dragged me hurriedly away.{&1310}\par We had to climb over a bunch of those poor people to get to the other side of the cabin. They barely seemed to notice. A lot of coughing, low whispers, and a few children crying. I think it was one of the dirtiest places I had ever been. Ever. And dad just pulled my right on through it as if it were nothing.{&1310}\par "Uh ..."{&1310}\par He hit the doors to some other room, and yanked me through with one last look behind for good measure. We were in some kind of hallway then. And I guess we weren't supposed to be there, because there was a uniformed man with a heavy shock-stick that came at us with an angry look.{&1310}\par "No one's allowed out of the aft lounge during transit," he started to say. By his tone, I guess he was pretty used to dealing with the kinds of people stuffed together back in the cabin. But dad didn't give him a chance to do much else.{&1310}\par My ears twitched as he swung a hand up. The Voidtongue again. This time, it threw the guard over into the wall, out cold without another word. He slumped down to the deck on his side. And I just stared, wide-eyed, at the man on the ground.{&1310}\par "What did you do \i that\i0  for?" I almost shrieked at him in surprise.{&1310}\par "Keep moving," was all dad said, not bothering to answer. Or wait for me to pick up again. He just snatched my hand back, hauling me along again down the hall. I twisted around, eying the guard's body as we stalked away, leaving him quickly behind.{&1310}\par Dad gave a few more guards that got in the way his violent sleep treatment as we made our way through the bowels of the ship up toward what must have been the upper decks. I didn't know where he was going, or why. And he could barely stop long enough to make sure he was going the way he meant to, let alone to explain any of that mess to me. I tried to keep up with him the best I could. {&1310}\par It was hard not to get a little worried at the way he was carrying on. A few glimpses of his deceptively serene face told me enough. A cold sweat glimmered at the sides. Maybe he hid it from me more than himself, but I could tell. He was scared. And that started to absolute terrify me.{&1310}\par I was a nervous wreck too by the time we got upstairs. And I nearly jumped out of my skin when we abruptly came up short at the site of hooded figure from before standing alone in the next corridor.{&1310}\par Dad let me go, and pushed me back behind him. I noticed what he must have instantly, a moment later. The few guards that littered the floor ahead weren't his work. They had throats cut and stomachs sliced open, already bled out onto the deck. Already dead. And that hooded figure stood in the middle of them.{&1310}\par How did he get ahead of us?{&1310}\par I didn't have long to wonder at that, though. Footsteps clambered down the stairwell behind us, and I twisted around. Another, smaller dark figure was coming up after us from down there, with two of the biggest and ugliest looking monsters I had ever seen to either side. Huge, yellowed fangs poked out from lumpy faces, both hunkering down to keep their tufted heads underneath the ceiling. They took up the entire stairway.{&1310}\par Dad lifted a hand, lips moving quickly. Those three down below stopped at the gesture like they knew what it meant. And he held them there for a moment, eyes darting back and forth between them and the lone man standing ahead. I just stood there, still as stone and wondering what the hell was going on. I wasn't quite brave enough to ask it, though.{&1310}\par "You know why I'm here," the man down the corridor uttered then. His voice was low, and rich. He was big beneath his rags too, and I caught a glint of steel when I looked. For a moment, I could feel the eyes beneath his hood on me. And my skin crawled (so bad{&47}until) I was sure it would slide right off the bone. But he wasn't talking to me.{&1310}\par "Hand over the girl," was all he said. To dad. I glanced back down toward the three below, the brutish monsters inching closer when they thought dad wasn't paying enough attention. The third, a woman, held her ground for now.{&1310}\par And that was when I suddenly realized just who he meant for dad to hand over.{&1310}\par "\i What\i0 ?" {&1310}\par I did shriek at him this time. I looked from the man to the woman and the two monsters, and tried to squeeze myself even further away against the wall behind dad. The woman below was eying me like she meant to disect my insides, and those two brutes just looked hungry. The hooded man didn't pay me any more notice, but that hate seething in the air was so thick I could almost taste it.{&1310}\par Dad stuck his other hand up in my face to silence me. For once, I couldn't even argue.{&1310}\par "You're a fool if you think I would ever do so willingly," he said right back at the hooded man. The tone of his voice was new. Dangerous. I had never heard him talk like that before. To anyone. "Step aside. \i Now\i0 ."{&1310}\par I would have. Oh god, but I would have if he had been talking to me just then, and I scrunched even deeper against the wall. But he wasn't. And the other man didn't seem to care.{&1310}\par "I am sorry that you feel that way ... old man."{&1310}\par The way he said it was slow. Threatening. {&1310}\par Something moved underneath his rags.{&1310}\par And so did dad.{&1310}\par Light filled the corridor in an instant. Blinding. I felt a hand catch and shove me back into the wall, and I bounced off into the ground with a pitiful thud. Fire and lightning screamed overhead, eating up all other sound until the whole world around was thunder and burning flesh. I clapped both hands over my ears and hugged the deck like there was nothing else. And, for a single moment, there wasn't.{&1310}\par Then I saw dad again.{&1310}\par Nolan Weir's hands were on fire. His face was still smooth, but his eyes blazed (bright{&47}hot) with that murderous inferno. First one way, and then the other - he rounded on the three behind and lobbed a ball of fire down the stairs. It hit one of the brutes. There was a crack like a whip. Then the whole stair went up in flames, chunks of the beast roaring out of it.{&1310}\par The hooded man in rags was next. Dad's other hand leapt up, and lightning flashed. It snapped into those rags, lighting them up. The man tumbled back over into the wall without a sound.{&1310}\par Thunder boomed.{&1310}\par Dad had my arm in his hand then, tearing me back up from the floor.{&1310}\par "Run! Get out of here!" {&1310}\par He shouted at me over the storm. Impossibly, I could already hear the two still remaining below scrambling up the steps again. I stared at him dumbly, wide-eyed and in shock. And he just snatched my dead weight to him, snarling down my neck.{&1310}\par "Get off the ship!"{&1310}\par The one remaining brute was on us. It loomed out of the smoke and flames with its yellow-fanged maw gaping. Dad flicked a wrist without a second thought, sending it spinning over backwards in tiny pieces and away. I think I started to choke.{&1310}\par He hauled me up again, and shoved me headlong ahead into the corridor. I stumbled wildly past the man in rags, leaden limbs flailing, and hit the deck again at the other end. And I sat there for a long moment, gagging on rent flesh, coppery blood, and the impossibility of it all. {&1310}\par Dad caught me up behind.{&1310}\par "Evelyn! Run!" he shouted again, and I twisted back around. This time, though, it was to freeze up as that hooded man came up behind dad. A long, wicked black blade dangled in one hand beneath those rags. And as the old man looked at me with his angrily pleading eyes, that other grabbed him by the shoulder and stuck him through.{&1310}\par I don't know how, but I was running after that. And the last thing I saw of dad was that hooded figure standing over him with his black sword before everything (dissolved into tears{&47}just fell apart around me).\cf2\f1\fs20 {&1310}\par }{&1310}
