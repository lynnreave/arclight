From there, I got an even better view of the undersides of those busted consoles and scrap scattered on the ground. I tried to push myself up with my one good arm, wincing and wondering if I could still call it that. By the time I did get myself up and sitting - leaning - against the downed pilot's chair, I was out of breath and sweating.{&1310}\par It was warm in there. Warmer than I had realized, though the smoke and burnt out panels might have had something to do with it. The air was different too, aside from the burnt-electronics smell. It stuck in my lungs like it was too full to get down. I had a hard time breathing it all.

But that wasn't too important then.\cf2\f1 {&1310}\par \cf1\f0 I was planetside.{&1310}\par I wheezed out a laugh, just staring. For a long while, it was just that open hole seeping in fresh, unfiltered air from outside. For a long while, my whole world. Then I moved toward the rear hatch. No power, though, of course. It took me a minute to figure out where the manual release was and even that wasn't working too well. Ducking down low, I skidded out into a wash of dazzling light.{&1310}\par I upended again. This time, though, it was back into the rear hatch and tumbling to the ground, hand clutched to my face. That light overwhelmed and blinded me, and I stumbled around in a white-black void behind the shadows of my fingers and aching eyelids for a couple seconds, flopping around on dirt. A loud, rustling noise had erupted everywhere all around me, but I couldn't see. After bumping the shuttle a few more times and gasping out in a panic, I tripped myself up completely and landed on my side, sucking in shallow breaths.{&1310}\par That rustling never stopped. The whole world was moving around me, unraveling and shifting like an angry maelstrom and I felt the air gust with a force strong enough to knock me over again when I tried to scramble back up. Again, I ended up panting frantically on the ground, eyes squeezed shut against the blinding light.{&1310}\par I had read about things like that. Maybe. That howling sound brought the idea of a terrible, planetside storm to mind, but I felt no water. There was supposed to be rain, I think. And light? It felt more like someone had thrown me into the sun.{&1310}\par It was hot. But not like that. It felt a bit anticlimactic, but I lay there for long enough to realize that nothing else was moving around me. At least not \i right\i0  around me. I couldn't speak for what I couldn't feel, though, and that's all I had left for what seemed like forever. I tried opening my eyes to the dirt a few times. Eventually, they took.{&1310}\par Grass, and dirt. The first thing I noticed was just how much of it. Even with the fading fuzziness and black spots in my eyes, I could see it stretch on forever. It moved lightly too, swaying in that gust that had me pinned down. Pushing in all over and across my body, it swept away some of that heat bearing down.{&1310}\par The light wasn't everywhere. I picked up on that pretty quickly once I got my eyes blinking into focus on the ground ahead again. I could feel it beating down into my back like that heat, and washing everything else around me. I started to get a good look at it all, though, up from the ground and following that vast expanse of earth and brush toward rigid stalks of bark and timber. Trees. Not like the ones in Riftwatch's gardens. Taller. Wild, and free.

More nothing metal or human or electronic in anyway outside the wreck of my shuttle.{&1310}\par I worked my way up those trees. They stretched on forever, spearing an overcast of pale blue. No stars. I almost panicked for another minute, but I remembered that that was normal. At least, planetside it was. \i Real\i0  atmosphere. I looked at fluffy, white ribbons scouring its length and fragmented memories of Ev's books told me clouds. Not like the flourescent nebulae of the Rift.

That thundering, howling rustle was thousands upon thousands of leaves tinkling in that torrential gust beating at my skin and clothes.

She tried to push herself up with her one good arm, wincing and wondering if she could still call it that.

Warmer than she had realized, though the smoke and burnt out panels might have had something to do with it. The air was different too, aside from the burnt electronics smell. It stuck in her lungs like it was too full to get down. She had a hard time breathing it all. And that was when she saw the back of the shuttle.{&1310}\par Eyes still a bit glazed over, she stared at where the hull had been punched right through. Not a big hole, but the dent around it was.

Brilliant, and warm.{&1310}\par The sun. {&1310}\par It was ahrd not to bask there, just laughing for a minute or two as she took it all in. She had never seen the sun. She had never been planetside before.{&1310}\par Her eyes adjusted. She looked around at the horizons with a big, silly grin on her face, spinning happily in circles untils he had her fill for a few. Trees billowed canopies of rustling branches teeming with thousands of tinkling leaves in the breeze - a symphony of sound a hundred times more beautiful than anything in Riftwatch's gardens. These were taller, and majestic. Humble, and not manufactured or cultivated in the least. Wild, and free. It was a place she could have never ever hoped more to see in her life just then.{&1310}\par Clouds tickled the sky in fluffy, white ribbons. Not like the flourescent nebulae of the Rift. These were different - much more new and real and beautiful. Even the smoke trailing up from her busted shuttle was beautiful then. But that was when she noticed its twin wisping some ways away.{&1310}\par "Evelyn."{&1310}\par Wistful daydreams dashed aside with her sudden charge toward that smoke. Hugging her hurt arm close, those trees swallowed her up fast as she tore away from the torn up mess of the shuttle's final descent and into the wild. It might have been a forest she landed in - what with all thsoe magnificent trees everywhere. She lost sight of the smoke trail inside them, but just kept on as straight as she could.{&1310}\par Dried leaves crunched underfoot and soft earth yielded, making her bounce along and scattering nature every which way. Broken branches and roots too. She tripped over a few times, swearing into a faceful of dirt before launching forward again. She wouldn't have thought it possible, but she was even more broken and useless by the time she found the trail again.{&1310}\par Canopies peeled back in the wind, and she caught another whiff of smoke. She squinted up above the trees and could just make it out with the sun beating down. She hobbled along again that way.{&1310}\par The brush got thicker, and she had to scale a boulder or two just to reach a fallen, rotting log to roll herself haphazardly over.

She had never been planetside before.{&1310}\par Her eyes adjusted. She looked around at the horizons with a big, silly grin on her face, spinning happily in circles untils he had her fill for a few. Trees billowed canopies of rustling branches teeming with thousands of tinkling leaves in the breeze - a symphony of sound a hundred times more beautiful than anything in Riftwatch's gardens.

Hugging her hurt arm close, those trees swallowed her up fast as she tore away from the torn up mess of the shuttle's final descent and into the wild.

She lost sight of the smoke trail inside them, but just kept on as straight as she could.{&1310}\par Dried leaves crunched underfoot and soft earth yielded, making her bounce along and scattering nature every which way. Broken branches and roots too. She tripped over a few times, swearing into a faceful of dirt before launching forward again. She wouldn't have thought it possible, but she was even more broken and useless by the time she found the trail again.{&1310}\par Canopies peeled back in the wind, and she caught another whiff of smoke.

"There's gotta be a release somewhere on this thing ..."{&1310}\par She scrounged around on the ground for a minute or so. Sweating, filthy, and wilting in the heat.

She yanked it the rest of the way and looked inside.{&1310}\par It was empty.{&1310}\par And she stared down inside, uncomprehending.{&1310}\par "Ev?" she finally asked to the empty space beneath. For some reason, it didn't feel like answering her back.{&1310}\par "... Doctor Weir ... ?"{&1310}\par That didn't seem to work either.{&1310}\par They had been in that pod. They \i had\i0  been. She was sure of it. And she had waited. She had waited for others.{&1310}\par They couldn't be -{&1310}\par No. She couldn't even think it.{&1310}\par She scrambled back up to her feet. {&1310}\par They had gotten out of there. She had already been too late. She must have been. They were free and out and already making their way through the forest back to somewhere safe.{&1310}\par She scrounged around the pod, desperate for any tracks. A footprint in the ash and mud, some trampled brush - anything. She made five runs around the steaming pod and cinders of fallen trees and ... nothing.{&1310}\par Giving up might have started to seem pretty good right then. Except she had no idea what else she could possibly do if she didn't find them. She was lost. And alone. She didn't even know what planet she was on.{&1310}\par She did find something, though. Eventually. {&1310}\par She was grasping at straws and fading hopes when she reached the edge of the clearing, arms wrapped tight around her to ward of the inevitable realization and hopelessness. She found a footprint in the dirt.{&1310}\par Or maybe not. {&1310}\par She stopped, and bent low. It looked like ... \i something\i0 , anyways. {&1310}\par Something heavy had printed in the dirt there. She didn't know much about those things, but someone always did in terrestrial vids. There were no other tracks around it. They just started up there, twenty feet away from the pod, and tore away into the woods. Nothing like shoeprints anyways.{&1310}\par She looked up that way, gradually. And it made the hairs on the back of her neck perk up. For a while, all she could do was stare into those shadows hidden away from the sun beneath the trees. And breathe.{&1310}\par Then something else broke the silence from behind.{&1310}\par Thunder cracked loud int he clouds above some distance off. No rain, though, or lightning. Just a heavy orange-yellow glow as they billowed out like steam from a covered pot. Tess shielded her eyes and watched as they suddenly belched up a flaming ball of molten metal then. It howled out of that hole in the sky and flashed down toward the groun. The earth rattled, and nearly took her off her feet as the thing plunge into the forest beside. When it was all over, she just stood there for a long moment, swallowing hard.{&1310}\par She had been wrong before, and hadn't waited long enough. But that couldn't stop her now. Without even a glance back at that dark spot in the woods, she took of as fast as her battered and bruised body would carry her. After that other pod.\cf2\f1 {&1310}\par }{&1310}

Smoke. The cabin was thick with it. My chest rattled as I glanced around quickly at the burst panels and dead readouts everywhere. My whole body ached, not just the one shoulder. I winced.{&1310}\par It took me some time to remember where I was. Longer still, to remember what had happened. While I waited, I started undoing the pilot's seat straps. I had taken the whole thing with me to the floor.{&1310}\par That shuttle barely made it through the atmosphere. Me too, though I had made sure to strap myself in tight this time. Too bad the thing shook itself to pieces anyways.{&1310}\par The autopilot took care of most of the mess, butt it was gone by the time we touched down. Crashed - more like it. The computer blew up in my face on the last few hundred meters down to the ground, and I felt some sticky blood on my cheek. It stung.{&1310}\par So much for keeping Nolan's shuttle in one piece.{&1310}\par I tumbled out of the chair with an unceremonious flop to the floor. From there, I got an even better view of the undersides of those busted consoles and scrap scattered on the ground. I tried to push myself up with my one good arm, wincing and wondering if I could still call it that. By the time I did get myself up and sitting - leaning - against the downed pilot's chair, I was out of breath and sweating.{&1310}\par It was warm in there. Warmer than I had realized, though the smoke and burnt out panels might have had something to do with it. The air was different too, aside from the burnt-electronics smell. It stuck in my lungs like it was too full to get down. I had a hard time breathing it all. And that was when I saw the back of the shuttle.{&1310}\par Eyes still a bit glassy, I stared at where the hull had been punched right through. Not a big hole, but the dent around it was. Not that the shuttle was getting back up anytime soon - or ever. I seemed to remember spinning end over end and hitting a lot on the way down and along the ground. But that wasn't too important then.\cf2\f1 {&1310}\par \cf1\f0 I was planetside.{&1310}\par I wheezed out a laugh, just staring. For a long while, it was just that open hole seeping in fresh, unfiltered air from outside. For a long while, my whole world. Then I moved toward the rear hatch. No power, though, of course. It took me a minute to figure out where the manual release was and even that wasn't working too well. Ducking down low, I skidded out into a wash of dazzling light.{&1310}\par I upended again. This time, though, it was back into the rear hatch and tumbling to the ground, hand clutched to my face. That light overwhelmed and blinded me, and I stumbled around in a white-black void behind the shadows of my fingers and aching eyelids for a couple seconds, flopping around on dirt. A loud, rustling noise had erupted everywhere all around me, but I couldn't see. After bumping the shuttle a few more times and gasping out in a panic, I tripped myself up completely and landed on my side, sucking in shallow breaths.{&1310}\par That rustling never stopped. The whole world was moving around me, unraveling and shifting like an angry maelstrom and I felt the air gust with a force strong enough to knock me over again when I tried to scramble back up. Again, I ended up panting frantically on the ground, eyes squeezed shut against the blinding light.{&1310}\par I had read about things like that. Maybe. That howling sound brought the idea of a terrible, planetside storm to mind, but I felt no water. There was supposed to be rain, I think. And light? It felt more like someone had thrown me into the sun.{&1310}\par It was hot. But not like that. It felt a bit anticlimactic, but I lay there for long enough to realize that nothing else was moving around me. At least not \i right\i0  around me. I couldn't speak for what I couldn't feel, though, and that's all I had left for what seemed like forever. I tried opening my eyes to the dirt a few times. Eventually, they took.{&1310}\par Grass, and dirt. The first thing I noticed was just how much of it. Even with the fading fuzziness and black spots in my eyes, I could see it stretch on forever. It moved lightly too, swaying in that gust that had me pinned down. Pushing in all over and across my body, it swept away some of that heat bearing down.{&1310}\par The light wasn't everywhere. I picked up on that pretty quickly once I got my eyes blinking into focus on the ground ahead again. I could feel it beating down into my back like that heat, and washing everything else around me. I started to get a good look at it all, though, up from the ground and following that vast expanse of earth and brush toward rigid stalks of bark and timber. Trees. Not like the ones in Riftwatch's gardens. Taller. Wild, and free. Crawling with bugs and rampant growth.{&1310}\par The sun.{&1310}\par I covered my eyes with a hand, and tentatively whisked back around. It kept the light dulled down to only near-blinding levels. And gave me the chance to get a better look around and up. More trees. More grass and dirt. More nothing metal or human or electronic in anyway outside the wreck of my shuttle.{&1310}\par I worked my way up those trees. They stretched on forever, spearing an overcast of pale blue. No stars. I almost panicked for another minute, but I remembered that that was normal. At least, planetside it was. \i Real\i0  atmosphere. I looked at fluffy, white ribbons scouring its length and Ev's books told me clouds. Not like the flourescent nebulae of the Rift. These were different - much more new and real and beautiful. Even the smoke trailing up from my busted shuttle was beautiful once the blinding light let up a bit. And my eyes were adjusting. But that was when I noticed its twin wisping some ways away.{&1310}\par "Ev ..."{&1310}\par That world wasn't coming apart around me. At least, I didn't think so. That thundering, howling rustle was thousands upon thousands of leaves tinkling in that torrential gust beating at my skin and clothes. I got up, and it tried to shove air down my throat in huge gulps. I could stand without falling over, though, if I remembered to try. It did, because I remembered why I was even there in the first place.{&1310}\par I charged toward that smoke.{&1310}\par {&1310}\par Hugging her hurt arm close, those trees swallowed her up fast as she tore away from the torn up mess of the shuttle's final descent and into the wild. It might have been a forest she landed in - what with all thsoe magnificent trees everywhere. She lost sight of the smoke trail inside them, but just kept on as straight as she could.{&1310}\par Dried leaves crunched underfoot and soft earth yielded, making her bounce along and scattering nature every which way. Broken branches and roots too. She tripped over a few times, swearing into a faceful of dirt before launching forward again. She wouldn't have thought it possible, but she was even more broken and useless by the time she found the trail again.{&1310}\par Canopies peeled back in the wind, and she caught another whiff of smoke. She squinted up above the trees and could just make it out with the sun beating down. She hobbled along again that way.{&1310}\par The brush got thicker, and she had to scale a boulder or two just to reach a fallen, rotting log to roll herself haphazardly over. She was sweating, breathless, and stumbling by the time she saw a splintered stake of wood on fire sticking out of the ground. She leaned against a tree beside her and just stared at it for a moment while she sucked in air through her teeth.{&1310}\par A big, steaming hunk of metal lay still just beyond.{&1310}\par She was shakier on her feet when she finally managed to push herself off again. This time, it wasn't the ground tripping her up. Eyes kept darting around that crashed pod, desperate for any sign of anyone. She half-stumbled, half-jogged over that way. But no one else was there.{&1310}\par Small fires and huge chunks of ash in upturned dirt littered the clearing where the pod had landed. At least, it was a clearing \i now\i0 . Trees lay felled, burnt, and exploded into timbers all around. A few had even collapsed on top of the thing itself, and she had to climb underneath to get to it.{&1310}\par Holding onto the trunk of one of those downed trees, she crouched down behind the pod. The rear hatch port was small, and cracked. No help there. She didn't bother trying to look inside.{&1310}\par "Okay," she took a deep breath. "There's gotta be a release somewhere on this thing ..."{&1310}\par She scrounged around on the ground for a minute or so. Sweating, filthy, and wilting in the heat. Dirt rained down fromt he broken trees above and she ignored it. But it wasn't until she tried to grab a hold of metal that she realized it wasn't the sun making her sweat. It was the pod.{&1310}\par She snatched that hand back before it melted her skin off. And stared dumbly at the bark on those trees atop the thing that had caught fire.{&1310}\par "Well. That was almost stupid."{&1310}\par She couldn't figure it out to open it. But it wasn't like she had anything better to do anyways. So she waited.{&1310}\par And waited.{&1310}\par And waited.{&1310}\par And eventually, it cooled down.{&1310}\par A lifetime later and she could get close enough to find the damn release.

Smoke. The cabin was thick with it. My chest rattled as I glanced around quickly at the burst panels and dead readouts everywhere. My whole body ached, not just the one shoulder. I winced.{&1310}\par It took me some time to remember where I was. Longer still, to remember what had happened. While I waited, I started undoing the pilot's seat straps. I had taken the whole thing with me to the floor.{&1310}\par That shuttle barely made it through the atmosphere. Me too, though I had made sure to strap myself in tight this time. Too bad the thing shook itself to pieces anyways.{&1310}\par The autopilot took care of most of the mess, butt it was gone by the time we touched down. Crashed - more like it. The computer blew up in my face on the last few hundred meters down to the ground, and I felt some sticky blood on my cheek. It stung.{&1310}\par So much for keeping Nolan's shuttle in one piece.{&1310}\par I tumbled out of the chair with an unceremonious flop to the floor. From there, I got an even better view of the undersides of those busted consoles and scrap scattered on the ground. I tried to push myself up with my one good arm, wincing and wondering if I could still call it that. By the time I did get myself up and sitting - leaning - against the downed pilot's chair, I was out of breath and sweating.{&1310}\par It was warm in there. Warmer than I had realized, though the smoke and burnt out panels might have had something to do with it. The air was different too, aside from the burnt-electronics smell. It stuck in my lungs like it was too full to get down. I had a hard time breathing it all. And that was when I saw the back of the shuttle.{&1310}\par Eyes still a bit glassy, I stared at where the hull had been punched right through. Not a big hole, but the dent around it was. Not that the shuttle was getting back up anytime soon - or ever. I seemed to remember spinning end over end and hitting a lot on the way down and along the ground. But that wasn't too important then.\cf2\f1 {&1310}\par \cf1\f0 I was planetside.{&1310}\par I wheezed out a laugh, just staring. For a long while, it was just that open hole seeping in fresh, unfiltered air from outside. For a long while, my whole world. Then I moved toward the rear hatch. No power, though, of course. It took me a minute to figure out where the manual release was and even that wasn't working too well. Ducking down low, I skidded out into a wash of dazzling light.{&1310}\par I upended again. This time, though, it was back into the rear hatch and tumbling to the ground, hand clutched to my face. That light overwhelmed and blinded me, and I stumbled around in a white-black void behind the shadows of my fingers and aching eyelids for a couple seconds, flopping around on dirt. A loud, rustling noise had erupted everywhere all around me, but I couldn't see. After bumping the shuttle a few more times and gasping out in a panic, I tripped myself up completely and landed on my side, sucking in shallow breaths.{&1310}\par That rustling never stopped. The whole world was moving around me, unraveling and shifting like an angry maelstrom and I felt the air gust with a force strong enough to knock me over again when I tried to scramble back up. Again, I ended up panting frantically on the ground, eyes squeezed shut against the blinding light.{&1310}\par I had read about things like that. Maybe. That howling sound brought the idea of a terrible, planetside storm to mind, but I felt no water. There was supposed to be rain, I think. And light? It felt more like someone had thrown me into the sun.{&1310}\par It was hot. But not like that. It felt a bit anticlimactic, but I lay there for long enough to realize that nothing else was moving around me. At least not \i right\i0  around me. I couldn't speak for what I couldn't feel, though, and that's all I had left for what seemed like forever. I tried opening my eyes to the dirt a few times. Eventually, they took.{&1310}\par Grass, and dirt. The first thing I noticed was just how much of it. Even with the fading fuzziness and black spots in my eyes, I could see it stretch on forever. It moved lightly too, swaying in that gust that had me pinned down. Pushing in all over and across my body, it swept away some of that heat bearing down.{&1310}\par The light wasn't everywhere. I picked up on that pretty quickly once I got my eyes blinking into focus on the ground ahead again. I could feel it beating down into my back like that heat, and washing everything else around me. I started to get a good look at it all, though, up from the ground and following that vast expanse of earth and brush toward rigid stalks of bark and timber. Trees. Not like the ones in Riftwatch's gardens. Taller. Wild, and free. Crawling with bugs and rampant growth.{&1310}\par The sun.{&1310}\par I covered my eyes with a hand, and tentatively whisked back around. It kept the light dulled down to only near-blinding levels. And gave me the chance to get a better look around and up. More trees. More grass and dirt. More nothing metal or human or electronic in anyway outside the wreck of my shuttle.{&1310}\par I worked my way up those trees. They stretched on forever, spearing an overcast of pale blue. No stars. I almost panicked for another minute, but I remembered that that was normal. At least, planetside it was. \i Real\i0  atmosphere. I looked at fluffy, white ribbons scouring its length and fragmented memories of Ev's books told me clouds. Not like the flourescent nebulae of the Rift. These were different - much more new and real and beautiful. Even the smoke trailing up from my busted shuttle was beautiful once the blinding light let up a bit. And my eyes were adjusting. But that was when I noticed its twin wisping some ways away.{&1310}\par "Ev ..."{&1310}\par That world wasn't coming apart around me. At least, I didn't think so. That thundering, howling rustle was thousands upon thousands of leaves tinkling in that torrential gust beating at my skin and clothes. I got up, and it tried to shove air down my throat in huge gulps. I could stand without falling over, though, if I remembered to try. It did, because I remembered why I was even there in the first place.{&1310}\par I charged off into the trees toward that smoke.\cf2\f1 {&1310}\par }{&1310}
