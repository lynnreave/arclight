She turned her head to look up at him when he didn't answer right away, and caught him staring.{&1310}\par "-- What?"{&1310}\par He shook his head and glanced away. He had been digging up old memories a lot of late. Too much that should remain buried.

Packed in with stinking, huddled masses of poor travelers dredged up from what must have been every desolate hole in the sector.

There was no space to think in this festering cell.{&1310}\par It was necessary. Just like everything he had had to do for the past two decades. He kept reminding himself of that, especially when he looked down into that dusky face with those familiar almond eyes.{&1310}\par "So," the girl was speaking again. She huffed out a heavy breath through her teeth. "Are you going to tell me where we're going or not?"{&1310}\par Sitting in the bowels of a rickety old transport cruiser for two days had drained her enthusiasm that much more. She had gotten a sarcastic attitude with him over the past twenty-four hours. A combination of several things, he was sure. Not to forget her little explosion at the docking platform when she found out they wouldn't be going back to the shuttle or that he had left her other bags behind in Riftwatch. That had soured her quite a bit. But, in the end, he assumed it was just because he refused to tell her anything she did not need to know. Which was a lot.{&1310}\par They would be half a week to Dregoran, stuck down there the whole while. Evelyn was hunched over next to him on the floor, lost amidst the throngs of squatting, coughing, filth-mongering passengers. She looked almost as miserable as they did now, if not nearly so unwashed. It became an effort not to feel more sympathy for her and that situation he was putting her through.{&1310}\par It was necessary.{&1310}\par "You'll know when we get there," he told her. And she grumbled out another irritable groan at that. He ignored it.{&1310}\par "Of \i course\i0  I will. But I want to know \i now\i0  ..."{&1310}\par But Nolan just hunched in deeper upon himself. The next several days would be long and insufferable, he knew. And matters would only escalate when they were done. All of a sudden, he had so much to do with so little time left to do it. It was a crushing weight that he had known so long ago that he could not escape. Ironic how the decision had seemed so simple back then. They always did.{&1310}\par But now ... {&1310}\par Now, he looked down at that innocent girl beside him all grown up and ...{&1310}\par Well. None of it seemed so easy anymore. He could still remember the day he took her away.{&1310}\par "Evelyn."{&1310}\par She rounded back on him once more, frowning.{&1310}\par "Yeah?"{&1310}\par He opened his mouth to tell her something. Maybe it was being in that place, alone, and so far from everything else that mattered just then. Maybe it was in seeing that look in profile on her face that reminded him so much of the mother she never knew. Maybe. But he would never know.{&1310}\par Something else snapped inside his head, hurling every other thought away.{&1310}\par It was several, long moments before Nolan stirred again. The girl's frown turned anxious and worried as he sat there staring off into space and through her like she wasn't even there. His face went white, and he started to shake.{&1310}\par "Dad ...?"{&1310}\par When she reached to touch him, he gasped back to life so suddenly she jumped herself. It took him another moment to steady his trembling hands. But then he was digging them into her arm.{&1310}\par "We need to get out of here!" he hissed in her face.{&1310}\par She opened her mouth to say something, but he never gave her the chance. Bounding back up to his feet, he hauled her up bodily with him. She might have cried out in surprise at the suddenness of it, but it was the furthest thing from Nolan's mind just then. He could \i feel\i0  the universe coming apart around them - like he had only one time before.{&1310}\par They had to climb over the hordes of destitute to get to the other side of the cabin. They barely seemed to notice. He didn't. A lot of coughing, low whispers, and a few children crying. He ignored it, pulling the girl right through now as if it were nothing.{&1310}\par In a few minutes, they undoubtedly would be.{&1310}\par "Uh ..."{&1310}\par He hit the doors and yanked her through without another word. They were in a corridor then, leading back toward the deck ports where they had boarded - where there were ladder and stairwells to the upper decks. None of the poor running in the bowels of the ship were supposed to be allowed out, though, and a uniformed man with a heavy shock-stick came at them immediately with an angry look.{&1310}\par "No one's allowed out of the aft lounge during transit," he started to say. Disinterested. Almost bored. He was used to dealing with the kinds of people stuffed together back in the hold behind. But Nolan didn't give him a chance to do much else.{&1310}\par He swung a hand up, words of power fluttering across his lips. The aether surged into and through him from nothing. He shouted the last of it at the guard and it threw him over into the wall, out cold without another sound. The man slumped down to the deck on his side. The girl stared, wide-eyed, at that body on the ground.{&1310}\par "What did you do \i that\i0  for?" she shrieked at him in surprise. He had been very careful never to let her see him use the Aetherian arts on another human being before. It was a shock that could not be helped.{&1310}\par "Keep moving," was all Nolan said, not bothering to answer, or wait for her to pick up again. He just snatched her hand back, hauling her along again down the hall. She twisted around, eying the guard's body as they stalked away, leaving him quickly behind.{&1310}\par He gave a few more security that got in the way his violent sleep treatment as they made their way through the lower decks and up. A cold sweat sheathed Nolan's face, and he had to grit his teeth to make himself go on when they reached a stairwell. It didn't go up as far as he needed it to, but he was having a hard time keeping his thinking straight. Not with that rending sound like the gnashing of teeth on space itself so deafening in his ears. A lesser man might have clawed them out. But a lesser man would not have been as attuned as he was.{&1310}\par A blessing, and a curse. For once in his long life, he wasn't entirely sure just why.{&1310}\par The girl was scared. Not that there was anything else he could do for her. He was scared himself, and with much more good reason to be. He knew everything that she did not, and there were a good many reasons to worry about whether or not they would even survive the next few minutes. That he had somehow been outmaneuvered was not lost on him in the slightest.{&1310}\par And that was why, in some ways, it was a godsend when they reached the next corridor and they were suddenly not alone anymore. No guards came at them this time. They had already crossed into the upper decks. No. Instead, their bodies were strewn all over the floor.\cf2\f1\fs20 {&1310}\par }{&1310}
