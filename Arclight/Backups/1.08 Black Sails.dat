It still looked like it must have in the Imperial days hundreds of years ago when it was a waypoint for pretty much all of the Helium-3 mining in the system. You could see the old, abbreviated name emblazoned on the sides of the docking pylons: HE3T -- Helium-3 Transfer station. Heet. \i Heat\i0 . They'd kept that dumb pun but spaced the Empire when the Grand Admirals originally converted it into a command and supply port for the Dreggoran Navy. And that was way back after they'd just finished winning the first rare victories for independence against the old Empire.{&1310}\par They had liked to drone on and on about that kind of thing throughout training. Heritage. Tradition. I guess we were supposed to take some sort of pride in becoming something bigger than just ourselves. Too bad it had to make you feel so small and insignificant to do that. But I think that was part of the point.{&1310}\par We had our leave assignments. Cadets, recruits, and all the future of the Dreggoran Navy, swarmed into the old fighter bays of the \i Soyorov\i0  that now only trafficked in people and cargo, ready to fly out back home. People who'd barely seen each other in six months came flooding out of the woodwork, shouting and excited about how they had weathered the storm of training and were just about to be done and commissioned. There were casualties they didn't tell you about. There were people who got sent hom that they \i did \i0 tell you about. But that was over. Everyone left had made it, through. Now just two weeks of home was all that was left between them and the final run, and every last one of them was determined to make the best of it. It was like watching a bunch of kids who'd suddenly been told by the adults to just go run and play. This was their bachelor's party before getting married to the Grand Admirals for the rest of their adult lives. I guess I was the only one getting cold feet.{&1310}\par "Cadet Evelyn Weir. Report to Shuttle 9419B in Bay 23."{&1310}\par "I'm already here," I muttered under by breath as I stepped up to the big hangar doors leading into Bay 23. Not that grumbling back at an automated message made any difference. It triggered in my personal comm because I was a second or two behind schedule in that annoyingly placid, female voice. The original architects must have meant it to sound neutral and attractive for the Grand Admirals' approval, but I swear I could always hear that faint hint of sarcasm when she had anything to say to me in particular. Oh, it was there -- I don't care what anybody might say. Tess would've thought so too. And I also liked to imagine that she'd been ugly, unlike her voice. I was probably the only one.{&1310}\par "Cadet," the shuttle pilot acknowledged as soon as I appeared in the bay. "Solansky, is it?" He barely looked up from the holopad on his arm as I stepped up to the onramp. "Come on, come on -- I'd like to get the hell off this warhorse before she decides to finally fall apart."{&1310}\par "Uh, Weir ... actually."{&1310}\par "What's that, cadet?" He did look up at me now. He was only an ensign with a boot-cut crew cut, but I could tell he took himself pretty seriously. Why did they always do that? Would I have if I'd actually made it?{&1310}\par Maybe. Whatever. Didn't matter much now anyways.{&1310}\par "Cadet Weir, reporting as ordered, sir." I stiffened up and reported formally. Didn't mean I put any real heart in it, though. It was an empty gesture to steal away any ammunition a commissioned officer might use against me before I was gone again. I kind of already felt like I was, even if it wasn't physically. Yet.{&1310}\par "Weir, huh," he said, and swiped a finger across his manifest like crossing my name off a list. Then he jabbed a thumb over his shoulder. "Take a seat and get strapped in, cadet. Only got a few of you shipping out to Riftwatch, but it'll take a frigate to get you all that far. We've got forty-nine minutes to rendezvous outside the station."{&1310}\par I only sort of recognized the dozen or so other trainees I found already belted in to short-range G-seats line up in two parallel rows inside the shuttle's tiny holding bay. We'd shipped out at different times, even though all cadets had come together at Heat Station for induction. Other children of personnel from back on Riftwatch that I never really got to know too well since dad had kept most of my schooling private. Miller was here, and I found an empty seat next to him as much for it being the closest one as the quasi-familiarity we shared from both being in the same training program. I guess it made sense for us psychos to sit together. {&1310}\par "You ... excited to go back home?" he asked after trying a little wave with his hand. It didn't work out too well with those restrictions from the seat over his chest and shoulders, and he frowned at that. Or maybe it was the asanine question. You'd think it'd be easy to keep your head clear after all that training in discipline and decorum but it was surprisingly easy to forget how to do simple things once the instructors and officers were suddenly gone -- when there was no one yelling at you when you did it wrong. Or telling you how to \i not \i0 fuck it up the next time. Now we were just so quickly nothing but helpless kids again, with way too much military lifestyle information crammed into our heads for it to just be natural. It made us awkward, ungainly, and out of place.{&1310}\par "I don't know," I told him as I strapped in, really being honest. I wanted to say yes, and at the same time no. I didn't feel excited -- more unsettled than anything else. Like I'd been given a big fat boot in the ass and wasn't quite sure where I was supposed to land yet.  "I'm  ready to be out and away from here, though. Does that count?"{&1310}\par He laughed in an uncertain way. Like he hadn't expected to and that answer had caught him off guard. It probably had. I'd never really known him before we shipped out -- coming here for the same program as him was probably the only reason we ever would have met in the first place. Weird how we could live on the same station, never cross paths, and then only find out the other existed because of this stupid academy. But he seemed genuine enough, even if this was probably the first time I'd ever really had him talk to me, specifically. I'd always just kind of lumped him together with his rackmate, Hammar, whenever I thought anything about him in passing.{&1310}\par But there was something comforting in not being alone now that I was finally going back home.{&1310}\par {&1310}\par {&1310}\par {&1310}\par I fell asleep waiting for our shuttle to break free from the \i Soyorov\i0  so I didn't get to see it again from the outside in all its retired old glory like I had coming in half a year ago. A lifetime ago. I wondered if it would've still been so intimidating, but I didn't think so. I'd seen much more enlighteningly terrible things to be afraid of. There would be plenty more too -- for the cadets who came back.{&1310}\par The pilot roused each of us -- I wasn't the only one to pass out so easily when I finally stopped moving and had nothing to do but think and wait. Miller tried to give me another smile from one side as he went about unhooking himself from his seat. The half-awake-and-irritable-at-being-woken-up attempt I made back probably came off more like a grimance.{&1310}\par They'd extended a gangplank between the airlock in the back of the shuttle and the frigate -- the ship was nowhere near as big as the \i Soyorov \i0 and didn't have hangar bays for passenger shuttles like the carrier did. The pilot said it was supposed to ferry us back to Riftwatch. I saw it through the steelglass, hanging there in space like a finless fish with gunmounts on it. Looking back, Heat Station floated behind us. I hadn't even gotten to set foot inside this time. We were probably the only trainees that needed a gunboat to carry us back home.{&1310}\par They said things had gotten that bad, but it was hard to believe the system news reports with how regulated by the Grand Admirals they were. And it was easy to forget inside that isolated bubble formed around us by the academy and training.{&1310}\par The lieutenant commander in charge of the frigate welcomed us formally to the ship, the \i Noybaerleen\i0 , though I'd have hardly called it much of a welcome. He kind of just gave us a curt, perfunctory permission to embark as the senior officer on board, but you could tell he didn't like us -- didn't want us there, and probably thought this "babysitting" thing was a waste of his time. Maybe it was. Either way, he dismissed both us and the shuttle pilot as quickly as humanly possible to return to his bridge, or whatever he felt was more important just then. A junior grade lieutenant with a nervous twitch in her right eye showed us to the lower deck and then surprised us all by ordering us to toss our packs in storage and change into G-Suits.{&1310}\par "Why?" I demanded, even though I knew it wouldn't change anything now that someone had made up their mind. It meant we were going to be traveling fast -- maybe even for a good reason.{&1310}\par The officer -- Cizeki, her uniform said -- settled back into a composed rest stance, looking at me but addressing everyone when she explained. She didn't have to bother with a cadet like me, and could have even told me to shut up. {&1310}\par "Pirate activity has been high in the region," she told us, being generous. I probably should have been grateful, but I wasn't. All I could think about was getting inside that glass, nightmare-prone prison once more. "Skipper's ordered all crew to the tubes for the trip. And until we get to port -- that means all of you, too."{&1310}\par "Has there been another attack?" one of the other trainees -- probably a future groundpounder from the look of him -- asked, sounding excited. I'd set a bad precedent and now I wasn't the only one to speak up out of turn. Thankfully, the lieutenant seemed just a little bit patient with a bunch of kids barely out of training. In spite of that nervous tick, she regarded him cooly.{&1310}\par "Don't you watch the news, recruit? Sightings," she told him. "If you want to know more than that, you're going to have to get commissioned or speculate on your own time. Now, get a move on, people!"{&1310}\par They'd come prepared with extra suits for us cadets and recruits and the lot of us quickly stripped down to our skivvies to get changed. I took the one the lieutenant handed me and started pulling it on, the whole while feeling like I'd rather just shoot myself in the head and get it over with now. The headaches and nightmares from the last trip to the field had finally just subsided earlier this week. I wasn't ready for another round yet, I just \i wasn't\i0 . Not so soon.{&1310}\par But what was I supposed to do? I could feel angry, hysterical tears burning behind my eyes and it was a struggle to keep them under control. \i Fuuuck\i0 . What was I supposed to do?{&1310}\par The only thing I really could. Just ... get in like every other time.{&1310}\par \i God\i0  ... {&1310}\par Why couldn't we just go normal speeds? Fuck pirate sightings. \i Fuck \i0 the pirates.{&1310}\par My body kept moving on its own, getting me dressed up in the G-suit like a robot despite those angry thoughts threatening to bubble up into desperation inside my head. Thank god for training. When I was done, I lined up with the others in front of the tanks that were set aside for us. It was just Lieutenant Cizeki on chaperone duty here in the aft section, no on else from the crew. She stood there with her hands on her hips watching over us trainees getting ourselves in and strapped one by one. I waited for my turn as people checked each other off and then she did too, making sure they were all hooked up right. That unsettled feeling I'd had ever since leaving Commander Delacroix's office had turned me into a taut string ready to snap down here at the claustrophobic thought of getting back inside one of those horror shows. I waited, but I could feel the tension like I would suddenly just break down and lose it any second if I didn't keep pushing it back down. And I still had the self-awareness to realize just how much it would ruin me to burst into tears right there in front of everyone. The instructors had always played it down, but it got harder every time. No one else would understand if I was so close to breaking -- I'd just be a freakout.{&1310}\par The lieutenant rounded on me, catching me by surprise. It was my turn, and I ... had a surreal moment then, suddenly staring back at the tank meant for me. I looked at it, and couldn't help but feel like a hole in my world had suddenly opened up there where no one else could see it. I was suddenly so sure that if I got inside that tank I would just fall through the cracks of reality and cease to exist here altogether.{&1310}\par How could I tell her that? How could I make her \i believe\i0  ...?{&1310}\par I don't know, but I turned back to try. It didn't matter. The whole ship had gone quiet -- \i too\i0  quiet for a military ship in port getting under way. I thought it was just me. Then the overhead lights winked out.{&1310}\par Cold washed over me like ice water, prickling my skin. I froze in place. There should have been cries of surprise -- maybe even alarm -- the tanks hadn't all sealed yet, and Cizeki had been standing right behind me. But there was nothing. Just the sound of my breathing in the still air.{&1310}\par Panic.{&1310}\par A dozen thoughts raced through my head. Power failure. Sabotage. Terrorist attack on the station. The ship? I could almost imagine the sound of turbines winding down to rest or the dull thud of explosions through the bulkheads. And I could only imagine -- because there was nothing. I suddenly couldn't even sense any of those trainees who had still been waiting around me just a second ago and there was this terrified fear of absolutely everyone just being \i gone\i0 .{&1310}\par I reached a hand out, reflexively. The need to not be suddenly alone in the dark was overwhelming. Primordial. {&1310}\par Nothing. {&1310}\par My mind raced along, but my body was sluggish. I staggered a step back and my foot caught on something. And the fall down to the ground seemed to last a quiet eternity there in the dark.{&1310}\par The deck was sticky. It stuck to my hand and my back.{&1310}\par Emergency lighting abruptly flashed on in dull reds, failsafes kicking in. They painted the black the color of blood.{&1310}\par I wasn't stupid enough to cry out. Something told me on a level I couldn't even comprehend that it would be the worst thing I could do. I could just barely see in the weak, reddish deck lights, but seeing at all made me need to move again. That same sense told me not to -- to stay put and shut up. Why? I don't know. I scrambled up instead on stupid instinct and saw the thing that had tripped me. I squinted at it for a long time before it started to look human. Human, but like the upper half had just been ripped away ... leaving only a pair of legs from the waist down ending in booted feet. That was what had tripped me.{&1310}\par Severed feet.{&1310}\par I wiped a hand to my face and froze when I saw what looked like blood there. It was the light. I had to be. But it stuck between my fingers, running slowly and thickly as I watched.{&1310}\par And that was when I noticed I was surrounded by those vaguely human-looking bits and pieces. They were all around me. Everywhere. There must have been a dozen when you added them all up. More, maybe. All of them just ... torn apart.{&1310}\par Something moved. The blackness suddenly shifted, coming alive. It blotted out the emergency lights and I sucked in a startled breath, wide-eyed and terrified. It whipped back and forth like a snake while I watched, transfixed. I didn't move now, but it knew I was there. Because I had moved when I shouldn't have. It knew I was there because it launched itself right at my head.{&1310}\par I crashed back down into the deck full of sticky red blood as it smothered me. I opened my mouth to scream and it squirmed right down my throat.{&1310}\par {&1310}\par {&1310}\par {&1310}\par "Hey!"{&1310}\par My body lurched up and out of the dark and suddenly people were there with the lights back on. Hands were on me -- I threw them off. That thing was down my throat and I was choking on it. I grabbed onto that someone who was trying to hold me down and shoved them away. Only after he tumbled over backwards into the deck did I realize it was just Miller. He looked up at me with a dazed expression on his face.{&1310}\par That thing in my throat was the breathing tube. I was gagging on it, the disgusting feel of that blackness so abruptly violating me all I could think about and making me choke. I reached up and ripped it out, throwing up water on myself while I did.{&1310}\par I was slumped over in my tank, drained and leaving me soaked in proto-amniotic fluid. The other trainees had been reactivating around me, climbing out of their tubes. A few glanced my way after I threw out Mills. He picked himself up from the floor, giving me a wary look.{&1310}\par "You okay, Weir?"{&1310}\par I tried to get my breathing under control, but I was still coughing up stuff from my stomach and lungs. It was just a dream. Just a dream. I forced that thought back down my throat as hard and fast as I could too. Just another \i stupid\i0  dream - like the others. I remembered now, things coming back in a jumbled rush. I'd managed to get in and go to sleep. Then I'd started dreaming back to getting on the ship with that morbid little bit of carnage thrown in just for fun. {&1310}\par These \i fucking\i0  tubes! {&1310}\par But it hadn't felt quite the same. I wasn't there as somebody else like living through a memory or riding around on the inside of their head. This time it was me and \i just\i0  me and that place was on a ship like this one and I didn't think I--{&1310}\par "Hey! Can you even hear me? Snap out of it, Weir!" {&1310}\par Miller was back in my face. I didn't think he meant to choke me this time, but I didn't get the chance to find out because that lieutenant who'd been chaperoning us from before came running into the room behind with a live rifle clutched in her hands. I remembered standing here and getting into the tube and, at the same time, falling in the dark before I ever could. I felt like I'd fallen out of time just looking at everyone suddenly displaced along with me. Except, they acted like nothing else had happened.{&1310}\par Why did it always feel so fucking real?{&1310}\par "Move it! Move it!" the lieutenant cried at us, still in her own G-suit and dripping translucent tank sludge all over the deck. It was pretty obvious she had just hopped out and grabbed a weapon. Her blond hair was dark and clinging to her lined face. "Get out of those tanks and line up, trainees!"{&1310}\par "What the hell ..." Mills muttered as his head whipped back around. For the first time, I realized that there were yellow warning lights flashing along the seams of the bulkheads and dull-pitched klaxons droning through the air. The ship was under attack.{&1310}\par "Pirates?" someone else blurted out before they could even get in formation, frozen and looking around in awe after coming to the same conclusion as me. The lieutenant just shook her head.{&1310}\par "That's not what you need to worry about right now, recruit. Fall in!"{&1310}\par He did. But not without barking out some more.{&1310}\par "What if there's a boarding party? We need to get to the armory! Uh, ma'am!"{&1310}\par He had that nervous excitement in his popping eyes beneath a shaved head, eyeballing the officer's rifle eagerly. Some of the others were coming alive too. Tank-sleep subdued by pre-battle anticipation. Because that was what they thought was happening. Months and months of training for just this sort of thing and now it was sort of just happening all of a sudden on this inconsequential little gunboat transport for a dozen boots.{&1310}\par "Shut your mouths," the woman snapped at them -- at us all -- with a warning finger, "and follow me."{&1310}\par Murmuring now. All that pro-military, fight-the-good-fight bullshit shoved down their throats this whole time abruptly vomited back up all at once. Not me -- I just felt like retching up something else entirely, though. I felt sick, that tank-dream still stuck in my head.{&1310}\par How did I know those bodies weren't theirs and I wasn't some freak prophet? It had happened before. Old Haakon was supposed to have only had the ability to See -- no other psychokinetic abilities. It was how they said he had beaten the Imperials, with their limitless fleets and death drones raining down from the skies on the scattered colonies. Maybe, but it was almost funny how much wishful thinking that was. Wouldn't it be easier to just accept that I had no talent at all? I guess so. But, if it was even possible -- well, too bad my dreams were only ever about death. That couldn't have been a good thing.{&1310}\par "Don't worry," Miller said as we jogged along after the lieutenant down the ship corridor. I realized he was talking to me. The rest of the crew were coming alive and bustling about, nearly running us over. He was looking back over his shoulder at me. Nervous, but he tried to hide it.{&1310}\par God, now \i really\i0  wasn't the time.{&1310}\par We didn't end up at the armory. Instead, the lieutenant took us to the tiny mess and stuck us trainees in there while she disappeared to report to the bridge. Some of the others -- like that one guy who'd seemed so eager -- were disappointed. Pissed even. If the door hadn't been locked from the outside behind the officer, I'm pretty sure they would have done something stupid. Instead, we were just stuck.{&1310}\par Stuck in that tiny little tomb on a ship under attack. And for some reason I was the only one who seemed worried sick instead of just feeling cheated.{&1310}\par The good news was that the mess had a port looking out into space. The bad news was that there was only one and everyone was suddenly shoving their way over there to see.{&1310}\par "Where are they?"{&1310}\par "I can't see anything."{&1310}\par "Goddamnit, let me in!"{&1310}\par A couple future grunts started fighting over the prime spots, but that got broken up quick when someone stabbed an overextended finger over their heads into the glass.{&1310}\par "Look!"{&1310}\par "Is that it?"{&1310}\par "I can't fucking tell!"{&1310}\par I couldn't see either and I wasn't sure I wanted too. I stood back from that mass of excited trainees just watching them, still feeling slightly nauseous. Miller looked like he wanted to join them too, but stayed back like me. Probably thought Psychos were better than all that useless jockeying. Hah. Maybe they were, who knew. But they should have been scared. There were some pretty damn good reasons to be.{&1310}\par I had read about this sort of thing -- we all had, during training. The pirates liked to leave improvised anti-high velocity travel devices like snares along known traffick routes between populated parts of the sector. Out here in the dark they'd catch ships helpless and get them. Not for the money, valuables, or cargo, though. Never that. Shenlizite -- that was all they ever took. The stuff they put in everything to make it work. Most ships and the crew onboard died pretty quickly once they ripped it out of the engines' fuel cells.{&1310}\par "No ensignia," someone noted.{&1310}\par "What?"{&1310}\par "They've got no ensignia -- it's gotta be pirates. Only they fly without colors out here."{&1310}\par "Who cares? It's all Tau bullshit anyways."{&1310}\par "Yeah, everyone knows they're funding the pieces of shit -- might as well be flying their banner for all it matters."{&1310}\par "I heard \i that\i0 ."{&1310}\par I didn't need to see the other ship to have a good idea what was coming our way. Maybe they hailed the captain and asked for him to surrender. Maybe they didn't. They probably didn't. All I had to wait for was the telltale rock of railgun fire. We all knew what it felt like in the simulations and somehow the real thing was still always ten times worse.{&1310}\par It was the fear.{&1310}\par The lights dimmed and the bulkheads came alive with the pervasive hum of power being redirected to ablative armor plating and weapons. We'd come in a gunship, so at least we could fight back. But that sickening wrench in my stomach from when I'd woken back up in the tank began to twist into a creeping sense of terror instead. Whatever happened -- we were helpless down here. I could see our deaths inside my head. Pitiful, hopless, and wasted.{&1310}\par "Here we go," someone said from inside that crowd of trainees squashed up against the port view. It had a reverential tone to it, like what someone might say before doing something profoundly unique for the first time. We could have been about to make a high-orbital jump, or have a first kiss. The quiet that settled over them all made the whole thing feel almost spiritual in nature.{&1310}\par I suddenly couldn't breathe.{&1310}\par Miller was muttering something under his breath. "\i Screw \i0 this."{&1310}\par He twisted back around, anxious frustration twisting his face. He went at the door and pounded a fist against it. {&1310}\par "What are you doing?" I managed to squeak at him, gagging on the feel of no air in my throat.{&1310}\par "It's locked, buddy," one of the crowd peeled his eyes away from the spectacle outside just long enough to chide Mills. Another guy followed him. And that one watched him ease up and flex his hand so that his palm was flat against the metal. His face smoothed out with it and he took a deep, calming breath.{&1310}\par "Fuck, man," that one elbowed the other in the arm, "he's a Psycho. You know what they can do?"{&1310}\par "Psycho-in-training," the first shook his head, but abandoned the port to keep watching Mills. His friend did too.{&1310}\par Miller had a hand reached out to the console now too and closed his eyes. I think he was trying to unlock it. From the outside or inside -- I don't know. I never saw any of the other cadets manage anything more than moving simple objects around during training. The hard stuff would've come later. But that never stopped some of them from experimenting on their own late at night in the safety of their bunkrooms. Maybe ...{&1310}\par "You can do it, Mills," I told him, as encouragingly as I could. I could hope.{&1310}\par "Shut up," he snapped, then completely reversed himself. "I mean -- sorry. I just ... I need to concentrate."{&1310}\par Cannon fire sounded above us, shaking the whole ship. People gasped, and I thought we'd been hit. Maybe it didn't even matter if we got out of that room -- if we were still going to be blown apart out in the middle of dead space. The ship shifted more and it happened again. But ... not a hit -- us \i firing\i0 . There was a cry of excitement and someone pounded the port window.{&1310}\par "They're not even fighting back! They're running!"{&1310}\par Those two guys watching Mills with me whipped back around, looking pissed.{&1310}\par "Damn it, we missed it!"{&1310}\par Some other guy flicked the pirate ship off through the port. "Suck on that, fucking assholes!"{&1310}\par "Look, they're fucking turning back ... god, they're running away!"{&1310}\par "Yeeeeah! Betcha didn't think it'd be a warship coming out at ya!"{&1310}\par "Fuuuck, yes."{&1310}\par And just like that ... it was over. No incoming fire. No boarding party. No real fighting.{&1310}\par Nothing.{&1310}\par Later on, the lieutenant would inform us that they had hit a snare while in HV travel -- just like I thought. The systems reactivated all hands before it even dropped back to normal speeds and the captain opened fire before the enemy ship made any attempt to communicate or attack. If they had been pirates -- and they probably had been -- they weren't counting on an armed military vessel and almost immediately retreated. She was pretty quick with assuring us that the other ship was no match for the \i Noybaerleen \i0 in a stand-up fight.{&1310}\par What she didn't think about -- or any of the other trainees for that matter -- was how easily this could have been an unarmed transport we were on -- even a year ago. The pirates hadn't been so bold with the main routes back then. No one would have thought they needed to divert an entire gunship just to ferry around some new recruits. And we all would have been dead.{&1310}\par It was why we were so lucky, but I didn't feel so good about it like all the other trainees. Neither did Mills, I could tell. We were the only two not smiling and bragging and chattering excitedly away about it the whole rest of the way to Riftwatch station.{&1310}\par He never had managed to get that door open and there was all the reason in the world to believe we would have died down there otherwise. Locked in and helpless. It wasn't the kind of thing anyone else wanted to think about when they thought about this guerilla war with the pirates.{&1310}\par Dying alone and helpless in the middle of nowhere.\cf2\f1 {&1310}\par }{&1310}

It still looked like it must have in the Imperial days hundreds of years ago when it was a waypoint for pretty much all of the Helium-3 mining in the system. You could see the old, abbreviated name emblazoned on the sides of the docking pylons: HE3T - Helium-3 Transfer station. Heet. \i Heat\i0 . They'd kept that dumb pun but spaced the Empire when the Grand Admirals originally converted it into a command and supply port for the Dreggoran Navy. And that was way back after they'd just finished winning the first victories for independence against the old Empire.{&1310}\par They had liked to drone on and on about that kind of thing throughout training. Heritage. Tradition. I guess we were supposed to take some sort of pride in becoming something bigger than just ourselves. Too bad it had to make you feel so small and insignificant to do that. But I think that was part of the point.{&1310}\par We had our leave assignments. Cadets, recruits, and all the future of the Dreggoran Navy, swarmed into the old fighter bays of the \i Soyorov\i0  that now only trafficked in people and cargo, ready to fly out back home. People who'd barely seen each other in six months came flooding out of the woodwork, shouting and excited about how they had weathered the storm of training and were just about to be done and commissioned. Two weeks of home, fun, and distance were all that was left between them and the final run, and every last one of them was determined to make the best of it. It was like watching a bunch of kids who'd suddenly been told by the adults to just go run and play. This was their bachelor's party before getting married to the Grand Admirals for the rest of their adult lives. I guess I was the only one getting cold feet.{&1310}\par "Cadet Evelyn Weir. Report to Shuttle 9419B in Bay 23."{&1310}\par "I'm already here," I muttered under by breath as I stepped up to the big hangar doors leading into Bay 23. Not that grumbling back at an automated message had any point. It triggered in my personal comm because I was a second or two behind schedule in that annoyingly placid, female voice. The original architects must have meant it to sound neutral and attractive for the Grand Admirals' approval, but I swear I could always hear that faint hint of sarcasm when she had anything to say to me in particular. Oh, it was there -- I don't care what anybody might say. Tess would've thought so too. And I also liked to imagine that she'd been ugly, unlike her voice. I was probably the only one.{&1310}\par "Cadet," the shuttle pilot acknowledged as soon as I appeared in the bay. "Solansky, is it?" He barely looked up from the holopad on his arm as I stepped up to the onramp. "Come on, come on -- I'd like to get the hell off this warhorse before she decides to finally fall apart."{&1310}\par "Uh, Weir ... actually."{&1310}\par "What's that, cadet?" He did look up at me now. He was only an ensign with a boot-cut crew cut, but I could tell he took himself pretty seriously. Why did they always do that? Would I have?{&1310}\par Whatever.{&1310}\par "Cadet Weir, reporting as ordered, sir." I stiffened up and reported formally. Didn't mean I put any real heart in it, though. It was an empty gesture to steal away any ammunition a commissioned officer might use against me before I was gone again. I kind of already felt like I was, even if it wasn't physically. Yet.{&1310}\par "Weir, huh," he said, and swiped a finger across his manifest like crossing my name off a list. Then he jabbed a thumb over his shoulder. "Take a seat and get strapped in, cadet. Only got a few of you shipping out to Riftwatch, but it'll take a frigate to get you all that far. We've got forty-nine minutes to rendezvous outside the station."{&1310}\par I only sort of recognized the dozen or so other trainees I found already belted in to short-range G-seats line up in two parallel rows inside the shuttle's tiny holding bay. We'd shipped out at different times, even though all cadets had come together at Heat Station for induction. Other children of personnel from back on Riftwatch that I never really got to know too well since dad had kept most of my schooling private. Miller was here, and I found an empty seat next to him as much for it being the closest one as the quasi-familiarity we shared from both being in the same training program. I guess it made sense for us psychos to sit together. {&1310}\par "You ... excited to go back home?" he asked after trying a little wave with his hand. It didn't work out too well with those restrictions from the seat over his chest and shoulders, and he frowned at that. Or maybe it was the asanine question. You'd think it'd be easy to keep your head clear after all that training in discipline and decorum but it was surprisingly easy to forget how to do simple things once the instructors and officers were suddenly gone, when there was no one yelling at you when you did it wrong -- or telling you how to \i not \i0 fuck it up next time. Now we were just so quickly nothing but helpless kids again, with way too much military lifestyle information crammed into our heads for it to just be natural. It made us awkward, ungainly, and out of place.{&1310}\par "I don't know," I told him as I strapped in, really being honest. I wanted to say yes, and at the same time no. I didn't feel excited -- more unsettled than anything else. Like I'd been given a big fat boot in the ass and wasn't quite sure where I was supposed to land yet.  "I'm  ready to be out and away from here, though. Does that count?"{&1310}\par He laughed in an uncertain way. Like he hadn't expected to and that answer had caught him off guard. It probably had. I'd never really known him before we shipped out -- coming here for the same program as him was probably the only reason we ever would have met in the first place. Weird how we could live on the same station, never cross paths, and then only find out the other existed because of this stupid academy. But he seemed genuine enough, even if this was probably the first time I'd ever really had him talk to me, specifically. I'd always just kind of lumped him together with his rackmate, Hammar, whenever I thought anything about him in passing.{&1310}\par But there was something comforting in not being alone now that I was finally going back home.{&1310}\par {&1310}\par {&1310}\par {&1310}\par I fell asleep waiting for our shuttle to break free from the \i Soyorov\i0  so I didn't get to see it again from the outside in all its retired old glory like I had coming in half a year ago. A lifetime ago. I wondered if it would've still been so intimidating, but I didn't think so. I'd seen much more enlighteningly terrible things to be afraid of. There would be plenty more too -- for the cadets who came back.{&1310}\par The pilot roused each of us -- I wasn't the only one to pass out so easily when I finally stopped moving and had nothing to do but think and wait. Miller tried to give me another smile from one side as he went about unhooking himself from his seat. The half-awake-and-irritable-at-being-woken-up attempt I made back probably came off more like a grimance. {&1310}\par They'd extended a gangplank between the airlock in the back of the shuttle and the frigate -- the ship was nowhere near as big as the \i Soyorov \i0 and didn't have hangar bays for passenger shuttles like the carrier did. The pilot said it was supposed to ferry us back to Riftwatch. I saw it through the steelglass, hanging there in space like a finless fish with gunmounts on it. Looking back, Heat Station floated behind us. I hadn't even gotten to set foot inside this time. We were probably the only trainees that needed a gunboat to carry us back home.{&1310}\par They said things had gotten that bad, but it was hard to believe the system news reports with how subsidized by the Grand Admirals they were. And it was easy to forget inside that isolated bubble formed around us by the academy and training.{&1310}\par The lieutenant commander in charge of the frigate welcomed us formally to the ship, the \i Noybaerleen\i0 , though I'd have hardly called it much of a welcome. He kind of just gave us a curt, perfunctory permission to embark as the senior officer on board, but you could tell he didn't like us -- didn't want us there, and probably thought this "babysitting" thing was a waste of his time. Maybe it was. Either way, he dismissed both us and the shuttle pilot as quickly as humanly possible to return to his bridge, or whatever he felt was more important  just then. A junior grade lieutenant with a nervous twitch in her right eye showed us to the lower deck and then surprised us all by ordering us to change into G-Suits.{&1310}\par "Why?" I demanded, even though I knew it wouldn't change anything now that someone had made up their mind. It meant we were going to be traveling fast -- maybe even for a good reason.{&1310}\par The officer settled back into a composed rest stance, looking at me but addressing everyone when she explained. She didn't have to bother with a cadet like me, and could have even told me to shut up. I probably should have been grateful, but all I could think about was getting inside that glass, nightmare-prone prison once more.{&1310}\par "Pirate activity has been high in the region," she told us, being generous. "Skipper's ordered all crew to the tubes for the trip. And until we get to port -- that means all of you, too."{&1310}\par "Has there been another attack?" one of the other trainees -- a future grunt from the look of him -- asked, sounding excited. I'd set a bad precedent and now I wasn't the only one to speak up out of turn. Thankfully, the lieutenant seemed just a little bit patient with a bunch of kids. In spite of that nervous tick, she regarded him cooly.{&1310}\par "Don't you watch the news, recruit? Sightings," she told him. "If you want to know more than that, you're going to have to get commissioned or speculate on your own time. Now, get a move on, people!"{&1310}\par They'd come prepared with extra suits for us cadets and recruits and the lot of us quickly stripped down to our skivvies to get changed. I took the one the lieutenant handed me and started pulling it on, the whole while feeling like I'd rather just shoot myself in the head and get it over with now. The headaches and nightmares from the last trip to the field had finally just subsided earlier this week. I wasn't ready for another round yet, I just \i wasn't\i0 . Not so soon.{&1310}\par But what was I supposed to do? I could feel angry, hysterical tears burning behind my eyes and it was a struggle to keep them under control. \i Fuck\i0 . What was I supposed to do?{&1310}\par The only thing I really could. Just ... get in like every other time.{&1310}\par \i God\i0  ...{&1310}\par My body kept moving on its own, getting me dressed up in the G-suit like a robot. Thank god for training. When I was done, I lined up with the others in front of the tanks that were set aside for us. It was just the lieutenant chaperoning us here in the aft section, no on else from the crew. The officer stood there with her hands on her hips watching over us trainees getting ourselves in and strapped one by one. I waited for my turn as people checked each other off and then she did too, making sure they were all hooked up right. That unsettled feeling I'd had ever since leaving Commander Delacroix's office had turned me into a taut string ready to snap down here at the claustrophobic thought of getting back inside one of those horror shows. I waited, but I could feel the tension like I would suddenly just break down and lose it any second. And I still had the self-awareness to realize just how much it would ruin me to burst into tears right there in front of everyone. The instructors had always played it down, but it got harder every time. No one else would understand if I was so close to breaking -- I'd just be a freakout.{&1310}\par The lieutenant rounded on me, catching me by surprise. It was my turn, and I ... had a surreal moment then, suddenly staring back at the tank meant for me. I looked at it, and couldn't help but feel like a whole in my world had suddenly opened up there where no one else could see it. I was suddenly so sure that if I got inside that tank I would just fall through and cease to exist here altogether.{&1310}\par How could I tell her that? How could I make her \i believe\i0  ...?{&1310}\par I didn't know, but I turned back to try. It didn't matter. The whole ship had gone quiet -- \i too\i0  quiet for a military ship in port getting under way. I thought it was just me. Then the overhead lights winked out.{&1310}\par Cold washed over me like ice water, prickling my skin. I froze in place. There should have been cries of surprise -- maybe even alarm -- the tanks hadn't all sealed yet, and there was the officer. But there was nothing. Just the sound of my breathing in the still air.{&1310}\par Panic.{&1310}\par A dozen thoughts raced through my head. Power failure. Sabotage. Terrorist attack on the station. The ship? I could almost imagine the sound of turbines winding down to rest or the dull thud of explosions through the bulkheads. And I could only imagine -- because there was nothing. I suddenly couldn't even sense any of those trainees who had still been waiting around me just a second ago and there was this terrified fear of absolutely everyone just being \i gone\i0 .{&1310}\par I reached a hand out, reflexively. The need to not be suddenly alone in the dark was overwhelming. Primordial. Nothing. My mind raced along, but my body was sluggish. I staggered a step back and my foot caught on someting. And the fall down to the ground seemed to last a quiet eternity there in the dark.{&1310}\par The deck was sticky. It stuck to my hand and my back.{&1310}\par Emergency lighting flashed on in dull reds, painting the black the color of blood.{&1310}\par I wasn't stupid enough to cry out. Something told me on a level I couldn't even comprehend that it would be the worst thing I could do. I could just barely see in the weak, reddish deck lights, but seeing at all made me need to move again. That same sense told me not to -- to stay put and shut up. For what? I don't know. I scrambled up instead on stupid instinct and saw the thing that had tripped me. I squinted at it for a long time before it started to look human. Human, but like the upper half had just been ripped away ... leaving only a pair of legs from the waist down ending in booted feet. That was what had tripped me.{&1310}\par I wiped a hand to my face and froze when I saw what looked like blood there. It was the light. I had to be. But it stuck between my fingers, running slowly and thickly as I watched.{&1310}\par And that was when I noticed I was surrounded by those vaguely human-looking bits and pieces. They were all around me. Everywhere. There must have been a dozen when you added them all up. More, maybe. All of them just ... torn apart.{&1310}\par Something moved. The blackness suddenly shifted, coming alive. It blotted out the emergency lights and I sucked in a startled breath, wide-eyed and terrified. It whipped back and forth like a snake while I watched, transfixed. I didn't move now, but it knew I was there. Because I had moved when I shouldn't have. It knew I was there because it launched itself right at my head.{&1310}\par I crashed back down into the deck full of sticky red blood as it smothered me. I opened my mouth to scream and it squirmed right down my throat.{&1310}\par {&1310}\par {&1310}\par {&1310}\par "Hey!"{&1310}\par My body lurched up and out of the dark and suddenly people were there with the lights back on. Hands were on me -- I threw them off. That thing was down my throat and I was choking on it. I grabbed onto that someone who was trying to hold me down and shoved them away. Only after he tumbled over backwards into the deck did I realize it was just Miller. He looked up at me with a dazed expression on his face.{&1310}\par That thing in my throat was the breathing tube. I was gagging on it, the disgusting feel of that blackness so abruptly violating me all I could think about and making me choke. I reached up and ripped it out, throwing up water on myself while I did.{&1310}\par I was slumped over in my tank, drained and leaving me soaked in proto-amniotic fluid. The other trainees had been reactivating around me, climbing out of their tubes. A few glanced my way after I threw out Mills. He picked himself up from the floor, giving me a wary look.{&1310}\par "You okay, Weir?"{&1310}\par I tried to get my breathing under control, but I was still coughing up stuff from my stomach and lungs. It was just a dream. Just a dream. I forced that thought back down my throat as hard and fast as I could too. Just another \i stupid\i0  dream - like the others. I remembered now, things coming back in a jumbled rush. I'd managed to get in and go to sleep. Then I'd started dreaming back to getting on the ship with that morbid little bit of carnage thrown in just for fun. {&1310}\par These \i fucking\i0  tubes! {&1310}\par But it hadn't felt quite the same. I wasn't there as somebody else like living through a memory or riding around on the inside of their head. This time it was me and \i just\i0  me and that place was on a ship like this one and I didn't think I--{&1310}\par "Hey! Can you even hear me? Snap out of it, Weir!" {&1310}\par Miller was back in my face. I didn't think he meant to choke me this time, but I didn't get the chance to find out because that lieutenant who'd been chaperoning us from before came running into the room behind with a live rifle clutched in her hands. I remembered standing here and getting into the tube and, at the same time, falling in the dark before I ever could. I felt like I'd fallen out of time just looking at everyone suddenly displaced along with me. Except, they acted like nothing else had happened.{&1310}\par Why did it always feel so fucking real?{&1310}\par "Move it! Move it!" the lieutenant cried at us, still in her own G-suit and dripping translucent tank sludge all over the deck. It was pretty obvious she had just hopped out and grabbed a weapon. Her blond hair was dark and clinging to her lined face. "Get out of those tanks and line up, trainees!"{&1310}\par "What the hell ..." Mills muttered as his head whipped back around. For the first time, I realized that there were yellow warning lights flashing along the seams of the bulkheads and dull-pitched klaxons droning through the air. The ship was under attack.{&1310}\par "Pirates?" someone else blurted out before they could even get in formation, frozen and looking around in awe after coming to the same conclusion as me. The lieutenant just shook her head.{&1310}\par "That's not what you need to worry about right now, recruit. Fall in!"{&1310}\par He did. But not without barking out some more.{&1310}\par "What if there's a boarding party? We need to get to the armory! Uh, ma'am!"{&1310}\par He had that nervous excitement in his popping eyes beneath a shaved head, eyeballing the officer's rifle eagerly. Some of the others were coming alive too. Tank-sleep subdued by pre-battle anticipation. Because that was what they thought was happening. Months and months of training for just this sort of thing and now it was sort of just happening all of a sudden on this inconsequential little gunboat transport for a dozen boots.{&1310}\par "Shut your mouths," the woman snapped at them -- at us all -- with a warning finger, "and follow me."{&1310}\par Murmuring now. All that pro-military, fight-the-good-fight bullshit shoved down their throats this whole time abruptly vomited back up all at once. Not me -- I just felt like retching up something else entirely, though. I felt sick, that tank-dream still stuck in my head.{&1310}\par How did I know those bodies weren't theirs and I wasn't some freak prophet? It had happened before. Old Haakon was supposed to have only had the ability to See -- no other psychokinetic abilities. It was how they said he had beaten the Imperials, with their limitless fleets and death drones raining down from the skies on the scattered colonies. Maybe, but it was almost funny how much wishful thinking that was. Wouldn't it be easier to just accept that I had no talent at all? I guess so. But, if it was even possible -- well, too bad my dreams were only ever about death. That couldn't have been a good thing.{&1310}\par "Don't worry," Miller said as we jogged along after the lieutenant down the ship corridor. I realized he was talking to me. The rest of the crew were coming alive and bustling about, nearly running us over. He was looking back over his shoulder at me. Nervous, but he tried to hide it.{&1310}\par God, now \i really\i0  wasn't the time.{&1310}\par We didn't end up at the armory. Instead, the lieutenant took us to the tiny mess and stuck us trainees in there while she disappeared to report to the bridge. Some of the others -- like that one guy who'd seemed so eager -- were disappointed. Pissed even. If the door hadn't been locked from the outside behind the officer, I'm pretty sure they would have done something stupid. Instead, we were just stuck.{&1310}\par Stuck in that tiny little tomb on a ship under attack. And for some reason I was the only one who seemed worried sick instead of just feeling cheated.{&1310}\par The good news was that the mess had a port looking out into space. The bad news was that there was only one and everyone was suddenly shoving their way over there to see.{&1310}\par "Where are they?"{&1310}\par "I can't see anything."{&1310}\par "Goddamnit, let me in!"{&1310}\par A couple future grunts started fighting over the prime spots, but that got broken up quick when someone stabbed an overextended finger over their heads into the glass.{&1310}\par "Look!"{&1310}\par "Is that it?"{&1310}\par "I can't fucking tell!"{&1310}\par I couldn't see either and I wasn't sure I wanted too. I stood back from that mass of excited trainees just watching them, still feeling slightly nauseous. Miller looked like he wanted to join them too, but stayed back like me. Probably thought Psychos were better than all that useless jockeying. Hah. Maybe they were, who knew. But they should have been scared. There were some pretty damn good reasons to be.{&1310}\par I had read about this sort of thing -- we all had, during training. The pirates liked to leave improvised anti-high velocity travel devices like snares along known traffick routes between populated parts of the sector. Out here in the dark they'd catch ships helpless and get them. Not for the money, valuables, or cargo, though. Never that. Shenlizite -- that was all they ever took. The stuff they put in everything to make it work. Most ships and the crew onboard died pretty quickly once they ripped it out of the engines' fuel cells.{&1310}\par "No ensignia," someone noted.{&1310}\par "What?"{&1310}\par "They've got no ensignia -- it's gotta be pirates. Only they fly without colors out here."{&1310}\par "Who cares? It's all Tau bullshit anyways."{&1310}\par "Yeah, everyone knows they're funding the pieces of shit -- might as well be flying their banner for all it matters."{&1310}\par "I heard \i that\i0 ."{&1310}\par I didn't need to see the other ship to have a good idea what was coming our way. Maybe they hailed the captain and asked for him to surrender. Maybe they didn't. They probably didn't. All I had to wait for was the telltale rock of railgun fire. We all knew what it felt like in the simulations and somehow the real thing was still always ten times worse.{&1310}\par It was the fear.{&1310}\par The lights dimmed and the bulkheads came alive with the pervasive hum of power being redirected to ablative armor plating and weapons. We'd come in a gunship, so at least we could fight back. But that sickening wrench in my stomach from when I'd woken back up in the tank began to twist into a creeping sense of terror instead. Whatever happened -- we were helpless down here. I could see our deaths inside my head. Pitiful, hopless, and wasted.{&1310}\par "Here we go," someone said from inside that crowd of trainees squashed up against the port view. It had a reverential tone to it, like what someone might say before doing something profoundly unique for the first time. We could have been about to make a high-orbital jump, or have a first kiss. The quiet that settled over them all made the whole thing feel almost spiritual in nature.{&1310}\par I suddenly couldn't breathe.{&1310}\par Miller was muttering something under his breath. "\i Screw \i0 this."{&1310}\par He twisted back around, anxious frustration twisting his face. He went at the door and pounded a fist against it. {&1310}\par "What are you doing?" I managed to squeak at him, gagging on the feel of no air in my throat.{&1310}\par "It's locked, buddy," one of the crowd peeled his eyes away from the spectacle outside just long enough to chide Mills. Another guy followed him. And that one watched him ease up and flex his hand so that his palm was flat against the metal. His face smoothed out with it and he took a deep, calming breath.{&1310}\par "Fuck, man," that one elbowed the other in the arm, "he's a Psycho. You know what they can do?"{&1310}\par "Psycho-in-training," the first shook his head, but abandoned the port to keep watching Mills. His friend did too.{&1310}\par Miller had a hand reached out to the console now too and closed his eyes. I think he was trying to unlock it. From the outside or inside -- I don't know. I never saw any of the other cadets manage anything more than moving simple objects around during training. The hard stuff would've come later. But that never stopped some of them from experimenting on their own late at night in the safety of their bunkrooms. Maybe ...{&1310}\par "You can do it, Mills," I told him, as encouragingly as I could. I could hope.{&1310}\par "Shut up," he snapped, then completely reversed himself. "I mean -- sorry. I just ... I need to concentrate."{&1310}\par Cannon fire sounded above us, shaking the whole ship. People gasped, and I thought we'd been hit. Maybe it didn't even matter if we got out of that room -- if we were still going to be blown apart out in the middle of dead space. The ship shifted more and it happened again. But ... not a hit -- us \i firing\i0 . There was a cry of excitement and someone pounded the port window.{&1310}\par "They're not even fighting back! They're running!"{&1310}\par Those two guys watching Mills with me whipped back around, looking pissed.{&1310}\par "Damn it, we missed it!"{&1310}\par Some other guy flicked the pirate ship off through the port. "Suck on that, fucking assholes!"{&1310}\par "Look, they're fucking turning back ... god, they're running away!"{&1310}\par "Yeeeeah! Betcha didn't think it'd be a warship coming out at ya!"{&1310}\par "Fuuuck, yes."{&1310}\par And just like that ... it was over. No incoming fire. No boarding party. No real fighting.{&1310}\par Nothing.{&1310}\par Later on, the lieutenant would inform us that they had hit a snare while in HV travel -- just like I thought. The systems reactivated all hands before it even dropped back to normal speeds and the captain opened fire before the enemy ship made any attempt to communicate or attack. If they had been pirates -- and they probably had been -- they weren't counting on an armed military vessel and almost immediately retreated. She was pretty quick with assuring us that the other ship was no match for the \i Noybaerleen \i0 in a stand-up fight.{&1310}\par What she didn't think about -- or any of the other trainees for that matter -- was how easily this could have been an unarmed transport we were on -- even a year ago. The pirates hadn't been so bold with the main routes back then. No one would have thought they needed to divert an entire gunship just to ferry around some new recruits. And we all would have been dead.{&1310}\par It was why we were so lucky, but I didn't feel so good about it like all the other trainees. Neither did Mills, I could tell. We were the only two not smiling and bragging and chattering excitedly away about it the whole rest of the way to Riftwatch station.{&1310}\par He never had managed to get that door open and there was all the reason in the world to believe we would have died down there otherwise. Locked in and helpless. It wasn't the kind of thing anyone else wanted to think about when they thought about this guerilla war with the pirates.{&1310}\par Dying alone and helpless in the middle of nowhere.\cf2\f1 {&1310}\par }{&1310}

It was a monolith of old imperial design from hundreds of years ago that had originally been built to be a waypoint for most of the Helium-3 mining in the whole Haiwon system. You could still see the old, abbreviated name emblazoned on the sides of the docking pylons: HE3T - Helium-3 Transfer station. Heet. \i Heat\i0 .

Two weeks of home, fun, and distance were all that was left between them and the final run and every last one of them was determined to make the best of it.

Only after he tumbled over backwards into the deck did I realize it was just Miller. He looked up at me with a dazed expression on his face.{&1310}\par That thing in my throat was the breathing tube. I was gagging on it, the disgusting feel of that blackness so abruptly violating me all I could think about and making me choke. I reached up and ripped it out, throwing up water on myself while I did.{&1310}\par I was slumped over in my tank, drained and leaving me soaked in proto-amniotic fluid.

He picked himself up from the floor, giving me a wary look.{&1310}\par "You okay, Weir?"{&1310}\par I tried to get my breathing under control, but I was still coughing up stuff from my stomach and lungs. It was just a dream. Just a dream. I forced that thought back down my throat as hard and fast as I could too. Just another \i stupid\i0  dream - like the others. These \i fucking\i0  tubes! {&1310}\par But it hadn't felt quite the same. I wasn't there as somebody else like living through a memory or riding around on the inside of their head.

They were all around me. Everywhere. There must have been a dozen when you added them all up. More, maybe. All of them just ... torn apart.{&1310}\par Something moved. The blackness suddenly shifted, coming alive. It blotted out the emergency lights and whipped back and forth like a snake while I watched, transfixed. I didn't move now, but it knew I was there. It launched itself right at my head.{&1310}\par I crashed back down into the deck full of sticky red blood as it smothered me. I opened my mouth to scream and it squirmed right down my throat.{&1310}\par {&1310}\par {&1310}\par {&1310}\par "Hey!"{&1310}\par My body lurched up and out of the dark and suddenly people were there with the lights back on. Hands were on me -- I threw them off. That thing was down my throat and I was choking on it. I grabbed onto that someone who was trying to hold me down and shoved them away. Only after he tumbled over backwards into the deck did I realize it was just Miller. He looked up at me with a dazed expression on his face.{&1310}\par That thing in my throat was the breathing tube. I was gagging on it, the disgusting feel of that blackness so abruptly violating me all I could think about and making me choke. I reached up and ripped it out, throwing up water on myself while I did.{&1310}\par I was slumped over in my tank, drained and leaving me soaked in proto-amniotic fluid. The other trainees had been reactivating around me, climbing out of their tubes. A few glanced my way after I threw out Mills. He picked himself up from the floor, giving me a wary look.{&1310}\par "You okay, Weir?"{&1310}\par I tried to get my breathing under control, but I was still coughing up stuff from my stomach and lungs. It was just a dream. Just a dream. I forced that thought back down my throat as hard and fast as I could too. Just another \i stupid\i0  dream - like the others. These \i fucking\i0  tubes! {&1310}\par But it hadn't felt quite the same. I wasn't there as somebody else like living through a memory or riding around on the inside of their head. This time it was me and \i just\i0  me and that place was on a ship like this one and I didn't think I--{&1310}\par "Hey! Can you even hear me? Snap out of it, Weir!" {&1310}\par Miller was back in my face. I didn't think he meant to choke me this time, but I didn't get the chance to find out because that lieutenant who'd been chaperoning us from before came running into the room behind with a live rifle clutched in her hands.{&1310}\par "Move it! Move it!" she cried at us, still in her own G-suit and dripping translucent tank sludge all over the deck. Her blond hair had darkneed in its taught ponytail. "Get out of those tanks and line up, trainees!"{&1310}\par "What the hell ..." Mills muttered as his head whipped back around. For the first time, I realized that there were yellow warning lights flashing along the seams of the bulkheads and dull-pitched klaxons droning through the air. The ship was under attack.{&1310}\par "Pirates?" someone else blurted out before they could even get in formation, frozen and looking around in awe after coming to the same conclusion as me. The lieutenant just shook her head.{&1310}\par "That's not what you need to worry about right now, recruit. Fall in!"{&1310}\par He did. But not without asking more questions.{&1310}\par "What if there's a boarding part? We need to get to the armory! Uh, ma'am!"{&1310}\par He had that nervous excitement in his popping eyes beneath a shaved head, eyeballing the officer's rifle eagerly. Someof the others were coming alive with all that too -- tank-sleep subdued by pre-battle anticipation. Because that was what they thought was happening. Months and months of training for just this sort of thing and now it was sort of just happening all of a sudden on this inconsequential little gunboat transport for a dozen boots.{&1310}\par "Shut your mouths," the woman snapped at them -- at us all -- with a warning finger, "and follow me."{&1310}\par Murmuring now. All that pro-military, fight-the-good-fight bullshit shoved down their throats this whole time abruptly vomited back up all at once. Not me, though. I just felt sick, that tank-dream still stuck in my head.{&1310}\par How did I know those bodies weren't there's and I wasn't some freak prophet? It had happened before. Old Haakon was supposed to have only had the ability to See - no other psychokinetic abilities. It was how they said he beat the Imperials, with their limitless fleets and death drones raining down from the skies on the scattered colonies. Maybe, but it was almost funny how much wishful thinking that was. Wouldn't it be easier to just accept I had no talent at all? I guess so. But, if it was even possible -- well, too bad my dreams were only ever about death. That couldn't have been a good thing.{&1310}\par "Don't worry," Miller said as we jogged along after the lieutenant downt he ship corridor. I realized he was talking to me. The rest of the crew were coming alive and bustling about, nearling running us over. He was looking back over his shoulder at me. Nervous, but he tried to hide it.{&1310}\par We didn't end up at the armory. Instead, the lieutenant took us to the tiny mess and stuck us trainees in there while she disappeared to report to the bridge. Some of the others -- like that one guy who'd seemed so eager -- were disappointed. Pissed even. If the door hadn't been locked from the outside behind the officer, I'm pretty sure they would have done something stupid. Instead, we were just stuck.{&1310}\par Stuck in that tiny tomb on a ship under attack. And for some reason I was the only one who seemed worried instead of just cheated.{&1310}\par The good news was that the mess had a port looking out into space. The bad news was that there was only one and everyone was suddenly shoving their way over there to see.{&1310}\par "Where are they?"{&1310}\par "I can't see anything."{&1310}\par "Goddamnit, let me in!"{&1310}\par A couple future grunts started fighting over the prime spots, but that got broken up quick when someone stabbed an overextended finger over their heads into the glass.{&1310}\par "Look!"{&1310}\par "Is that it?"{&1310}\par "I can't fucking see anything!"{&1310}\par I couldn't see either and I wasn't sure I wanted too. I stood back from that mass of excited trainees just watching them. Miller looked like he wanted to join them too, but he stayed back like me. probably thought Psychoes were better than all that useless jockeying. Maybe they were, who knew. But they should have been scared. There some pretty damn good reasons to be.{&1310}\par I had read about this sort of thing -- we all had, during training. The pirates liked to leave improvised anti-high velocity travel devices like snares along known traffick routes between populated parts of the sector. Out here in the dark they'd catch ships helpless and get them.\cf2\f1 {&1310}\par }{&1310}

It was a monolith of old imperial design from hundreds of years ago that had originally been built to be a waypoint for most of the Helium-3 mining in the whole Haiwon system. You could still see the old, abbreviated name emblazoned on the sides of the docking pylons: HE3T - Helium-3 Transfer station. Heet. \i Heat\i0 . They'd kept the pun but gotten rid of the owners when the Grand Admirals originally converted it into a command and supply port for the Dreggoran Navy. That was way back after they'd finished winning the first victories for independence against the old Empire.{&1310}\par We had our leave assignments. Cadets, recruits, and all the future of the Dreggoran naval leadership swarmed into the old fighter bays of the \i Soyorov\i0  that now only trafficked in people and cargo, ready to fly out back home for leave. People who'd barely seen each other in six months came flooding out of the woodwork, shouting and excited about how they had weathered the storm of training and were just about to be done and commissioned. Two weeks of home, fun, and distance were all that was left between them and the final run and every last one of them was determined to make the best of it. It was like watching a bunch of kids who'd suddenly been told by the adults that they didn't have another care in the world -- to go run and play. This was their bachelor's party before getting married to the Grand Admirals for the rest of their adult lives. And, somehow, I was the only one getting cold feet.{&1310}\par "Cadet Evelyn Weir. Report to Shuttle 9419B in Bay 23."{&1310}\par "I'm already here," I muttered under by breath as I stepped up to the big hangar doors leading into Bay 23. Not that grumbling back at an automated message had any point. It triggered in my personal comm because I was a second or two behind schedule in that annoyingly placid, female voice. The original architects must have meant it to sound neutral and attractive for the Grand Admirals' approval, but I swear I could always hear the faintest hint of sarcasm patronizing me when she had anything for me to hear. I also liked to imagine that she'd been ugly, unlike her voice. I was probably the only one.{&1310}\par "Cadet," the shuttle pilot acknowledged as soon as I appeared in the bay. "Solansky, is it?" He barely looked up from the holopad on his arm as I stepped up to the onramp.{&1310}\par "Weir ... actually."{&1310}\par "What's that, cadet?" He did look up at me now. He was only an ensign with a boot-cut crew cut, but I could tell he took himself pretty seriously.{&1310}\par "Cadet Weir, reporting as ordered, sir." I stiffened up and reported formally. Didn't mean I put any real heart in it, though. It was an empty gesture to steal away any ammunition a commissioned officer might use against me before I was gone again.{&1310}\par "Weir, huh," he said, and swiped a finger across his manifest like crossing my name off a list. Then he jabbed a thumb over his shoulder. "Take a seat and get strapped in, cadet. Only got a few of you shipping out to Riftwatch, but it'll take a frigate to get you all that far. We've got forty-nine minutes to rendezvous outside the station."{&1310}\par I only sort of recognized the dozen or so other trainees I found already belted in to short-range G-seats line up in two parallel rows inside the shuttle's tiny holding bay. We'd shipped out at different times, even though all cadets had come together at Heat Station for induction. Other children of personnel from back on Riftwatch that I never really got to know too well since dad had kept most of my schooling private. Miller was here, and I found an empty seat next to him as much for it being the closest one as the quasi-familiarity we shared from both being in the same training program. It felt slightly less awkward than sitting near any of the rest of them.{&1310}\par "You, uh, excited to go back home?" he asked after trying a little wave with his hand that didn't work out to well from the restrictions of the seat over his chest and shoulders and left him with a dissatisfied frown for himself on his face.{&1310}\par I wanted to say yes, and at the same time no. So I just let "I don't know" fall out of my mouth with a sigh. I didn't really want to talk about it either way, so it worked out when he seemed to get the hint and left me alone after that.{&1310}\par {&1310}\par {&1310}\par {&1310}\par I fell asleep waiting for our shuttle to break free from the \i Soyorov\i0  so I didn't get to see it again from the outside in all its retired old glory like I had coming in half a year ago. A lifetime ago. I wondered if it would've still been so intimidating but I didn't think so. I'd seen much more enlighteningly terrible things to be afraid of. There would be plenty more too -- for the cadets who came back.{&1310}\par The pilot roused each of us -- I wasn't the only one to pass out so easily when I finally stopped moving and had nothing to do but think and wait. Miller tried to give me a smile from one side as he went about unhooking himself from his seat. The half-hearted attempt I made back probably came off more like a grimance than anything congenial.{&1310}\par They had extended a gangplank between the airlock in the back of the shuttle and the frigate -- the ship was nowhere near as big as the Soyorov and didn't have hangar bays for passenger shuttles like the carrier did. The pilot said it was suposed to ferry us back to Riftwatch. I saw it through the steelglass, hanging there in space like a finless fish with gunmounts on it. Looking back, Heat Station floated behind us. I hadn't even gotten to set foot inside this time. We were probably the only trainees that needed a gunboat to carry us back home.{&1310}\par They said things had gotten that bad, but it was hard to believe the newsreels with how subsidized by the Grand Admirals they were. And it was easy to forget inside that isolated bubble formed around us by the academy and training.{&1310}\par The lieutenant commander in charge of the frigate welcomed us curtly to his ship, the \i Noybaerleen\i0 , and dismissed both us and the shuttle pilot to return to his bridge. A junior grade lieutenant with a nervous twitch in her right eye showed us to the lower deck and then surprised us all by ordering us to change into G-Suits.{&1310}\par "Why?" I demanded, even though I knew it wouldn't change anything now that someone had made up their mind. We were traveling fast -- maybe even for a reason.{&1310}\par The officer settled back into a composed rest stance, looking at me but then addressing everyone.{&1310}\par "Pirate activity has been high in the region. Skipper's ordered all crew to the tubes for the trip and until we get to port -- that means all of you, too."{&1310}\par "Has there been another attack?" one of the other trainees -- a future grunt from the look of him -- asked, sounding excited. In spite of that nervous tick, the lieutenant regarded him cooly.{&1310}\par "Sightings," she told him. "But if there had been an attack, I certainly wouldn't be telling \i you\i0  about it, recruit. Now, get a move on, people!"{&1310}\par They'd come prepared with extra suits for us cadets and recruits and the lot of us quickly stripped down to our skivvies to get changed. I took the one the lieutenant handed me and started pulling it on, the whole while feeling that familiar sense of dread and discomfort. The headaches and nightmares fromt he last trip to the field had subsided days ago. I wasn't too eager to risk starting them up again. Not so soon.{&1310}\par When I was done, I lined up with the others in front of the tanks that were set aside for us. It was just the lieutenant chaperoning us here in the aft section, no on else from the crew. The officer stood there with her hands on her hips watching as us trainees got ourselves in and strapped one by one. I had a surreal moment then, staring back at the tank meant for me. I remembered thinking it was too quiet back here for a military ship in port. Right before the overhead lights went out.{&1310}\par Cold washed over me like ice water, prickling my skin. I froze in place. There should have been cries of surprise -- maybe even alarm. There was nothing. Just the sound of my breathing in the still air.{&1310}\par Panic.{&1310}\par A dozen thoughts raced through my head. Power failure. Sabotage. Terrorist attack on the station. The ship? I could almost imagine the sound of turbines winding down to rest or the dull thud of explosions through the bulkheads. And I could only imagine -- because there was nothing. I suddenly could even sense any of those trainees who had been bustling around me just a second ago and there was this terrified fear of everyone just being gone.{&1310}\par I reached a hand out, reflexively. The need to not be suddenly alone int he dark was overwhelming. Nothing. My mind raced along, but my body was sluggish. I staggered a step back and my foot caught on someting. And the fall down to the ground seemed to last a quiet eternity there in the dark.{&1310}\par The deck was sticky. It stuck to my hand and my back.{&1310}\par Emergency lighting flashed on in dull reds, painting the black the color of blood.{&1310}\par I wasn't stupid enough to cry out. Something told me on a level I couldn't even comprehend that it would be the worst thing I could do. I could just barely see in the weak, reddish deck lights, but seeing at all made me need to move again. That same sense told me not to -- to stay put and shut up. For what? I don't know. I scrambled up instead and saw the thing that had tripped me. I squinted at it for a long time before it started to look human. Human, but like the upper half had just been ripped away leaving only a pair of legs from the waist down ending in booted feet. That was what had tripped me.{&1310}\par I wiped a hand to my face and froze when I saw what looked like blood there. It was the light. I had to be. But it stuck between my fingers, running slowly and thickly as I watched.{&1310}\par And that was when I noticed I was surrounded by those vaguely human-looking bits and pieces. They were all around me. Everywhere. There must have been a dozen when you added them all up. More, maybe. All of them just ... torn apart.{&1310}\par Something moved. The blackness suddenly shifted, coming alive. It blotted out the emergency lights and whipped back and forth like a snake while I watched, transfixed. I didn't move now, but it knew I was there. It launched itself right at my head.{&1310}\par I crashed back down into the deck full of sticky red blood as it smothered me. I opened my mouth to scream and it squirmed right down my throat.{&1310}\par {&1310}\par {&1310}\par {&1310}\par "Hey!"{&1310}\par My body lurched up and out of the dark and suddenly people were there with the lights back on.

Out here in the dark they'd catch ships helpless and get them. Not for the money, valuables, or cargo, though. Never that. Shenlizite -- that was all they ever took. The stuff they put in everything to make it work. Most ships and the crew onboard died pretty quickly once they ripped it out of the engines' fuel cells.{&1310}\par "No ensignia," someone noted.{&1310}\par "What?"{&1310}\par "They've got no ensignia -- it's gotta be pirates. Only they fly without colors out here."{&1310}\par "Who cares? It's all Tau bullshit anyways."{&1310}\par "Yeah, everyone knows they're funding the pieces of shit -- might as well be flying their banner for all it matters."{&1310}\par "I heard \i that\i0 ."{&1310}\par I didn't need to see the other ship to have a good idea what was coming our way. Maybe they hailed the captain and asked for him to surrender, maybe they didn't. They probably didn't. All I had to wait for was the telltale rock of railgun fire. We all knew what it felt like in the simulations and somehow the real thing was always ten times worse.{&1310}\par It was the fear.{&1310}\par The lights dimmed and the bulkheads came alive with the pervasive hum of power being redirected to ablative armor plating and weapons. We'd come in a gunship, so at least we could fight back. But  that sickening wrench in my stomach from when I'd woekn back up in the tank began to twist into a creeping sense of terror instead. Whatever happened -- we were helpless down here. I could see our deaths in my head. Pitiful, hopless, and wasted.{&1310}\par "Here we go," someone said from inside that crowd of trainees squashed up against the port view. It had a reverential tone to it, like what someone might say before doing something profoundly unique for the first time. We could have been about to make a high-orbital jump or have a first kiss. The quiet that settled over them all made the whole thing feel almost spiritual in nature.{&1310}\par I suddenly couldn't breathe.{&1310}\par "\i Screw \i0 this."{&1310}\par Miller twisted back around, anxious frustration twisting his face. He went at the door and poundd a fist against it. Gagging on the feel of no air in my throat, I just watched him do it.{&1310}\par "It's locked, buddy," one of the crowd peeled his eyes away from the spectacle outside just long enough to chide Mills. Another guy followed him.{&1310}\par "Fuck, man," that one elbowed the other in the arm, "he's a Psycho. You know what they can do?"{&1310}\par "Psycho in training," the first shook his head, but abandoned the port to keep watching Mills. His friend did too.{&1310}\par Miller had a hand reached out to the console and had closed his eyes. I think he was trying to unlock it. From the outside or inside -- I didn't know. I never saw any of the other cadets manage anything more than moving simple objects around during training. The hard stuff would've come later. But that never stopped some of them from experimenting on their own late at night in the safety of their bunkrooms. Maybe ...{&1310}\par Cannon fire sounded above us, shaking the whole ship. People gasped, and I thought we'd been hit. The ship shifted more and it happened again. Not a hit -- us firing. There was a cry of excitement and someone pounded the port window.{&1310}\par "They're not even fighting back! They're running!"{&1310}\par Those two guys watching Mills with me whipped back around, looking pissed.{&1310}\par "Damn it, we missed it!"{&1310}\par "Look, they're fucking ... god, they're running away!"{&1310}\par "Yeeeeah! Betcha didn't think it'd be a warship coming out at ya!"{&1310}\par "Fuuuck, yes."{&1310}\par "Suck on that, fucking assholes!"{&1310}\par Some other guy flicked the pirate ship off through the port.{&1310}\par And just like that ... it was over. No incoming fire. No boarding party. No real fighting.{&1310}\par Nothing.{&1310}\par Later on, the lieutenant would inform us that they had hit a snare while in HV travel -- just like I thought. The systems reactivated all hands before it even dropped back to normal speeds and the captain opened fire before the enemy ship made any attempt to communicate or attack. If they had been pirates -- and they probably had been -- they weren't counting on an armed military vessel and almost immediately retreated. She was pretty quick with assuring us that the other ship was no match for the \i Noybaerleen \i0 in a stand-up fight.{&1310}\par What she didn't think about -- or any of the other trainees for that matter -- was how easily this could have been an unarmed transport we were on even a year ago. The pirates hadn't been so bold with the main routes back then. No one would have thought they needed to divert an gunship just to ferry around some new recruits. And we all would have been dead.{&1310}\par It was why we were so lucky, but I didn't feel so good about it like all the other trainees. Neither did Mills, I could tell. We were the only two not smiling and bragging and chattering excitedly away about it the whole rest of the way to Riftwatch station.{&1310}\par He never had managed to get that door open and there was all the reason in the world to believe we would have died downthere.

It still looked like it must have in the Imperial days hundreds of years ago when it was a waypoint for pretty much all of the Helium-3 mining in the system. You could see the old, abbreviated name emblazoned on the sides of the docking pylons: HE3T - Helium-3 Transfer station. Heet. \i Heat\i0 . They'd kept that dumb pun but spaced the Empire when the Grand Admirals originally converted it into a command and supply port for the Dreggoran Navy. And that was way back after they'd just finished winning the first victories for independence against the old Empire.{&1310}\par They had liked to drone on and on about that kind of thing throughout training. Heritage. Tradition. I guess we were supposed to take some sort of pride in becoming something bigger than just ourselves. Too bad it had to make you feel so small and insignificant to do that. But I think that was part of the point.{&1310}\par We had our leave assignments. Cadets, recruits, and all the future of the Dreggoran Navy, swarmed into the old fighter bays of the \i Soyorov\i0  that now only trafficked in people and cargo, ready to fly out back home. People who'd barely seen each other in six months came flooding out of the woodwork, shouting and excited about how they had weathered the storm of training and were just about to be done and commissioned. Two weeks of home, fun, and distance were all that was left between them and the final run, and every last one of them was determined to make the best of it. It was like watching a bunch of kids who'd suddenly been told by the adults to just go run and play. This was their bachelor's party before getting married to the Grand Admirals for the rest of their adult lives. I guess I was the only one getting cold feet.{&1310}\par "Cadet Evelyn Weir. Report to Shuttle 9419B in Bay 23."{&1310}\par "I'm already here," I muttered under by breath as I stepped up to the big hangar doors leading into Bay 23. Not that grumbling back at an automated message had any point. It triggered in my personal comm because I was a second or two behind schedule in that annoyingly placid, female voice. The original architects must have meant it to sound neutral and attractive for the Grand Admirals' approval, but I swear I could always hear that faint hint of sarcasm when she had anything to say to me in particular. Oh, it was there -- I don't care what anybody might say. Tess would've thought so too. And I also liked to imagine that she'd been ugly, unlike her voice. I was probably the only one.{&1310}\par "Cadet," the shuttle pilot acknowledged as soon as I appeared in the bay. "Solansky, is it?" He barely looked up from the holopad on his arm as I stepped up to the onramp. "Come on, come on -- I'd like to get the hell off this warhorse before she decides to finally fall apart."{&1310}\par "Uh, Weir ... actually."{&1310}\par "What's that, cadet?" He did look up at me now. He was only an ensign with a boot-cut crew cut, but I could tell he took himself pretty seriously. Why did they always do that? Would I have?{&1310}\par Whatever.{&1310}\par "Cadet Weir, reporting as ordered, sir." I stiffened up and reported formally. Didn't mean I put any real heart in it, though. It was an empty gesture to steal away any ammunition a commissioned officer might use against me before I was gone again. I kind of already felt like I was, even if it wasn't physically. Yet.{&1310}\par "Weir, huh," he said, and swiped a finger across his manifest like crossing my name off a list. Then he jabbed a thumb over his shoulder. "Take a seat and get strapped in, cadet. Only got a few of you shipping out to Riftwatch, but it'll take a frigate to get you all that far. We've got forty-nine minutes to rendezvous outside the station."{&1310}\par I only sort of recognized the dozen or so other trainees I found already belted in to short-range G-seats line up in two parallel rows inside the shuttle's tiny holding bay. We'd shipped out at different times, even though all cadets had come together at Heat Station for induction. Other children of personnel from back on Riftwatch that I never really got to know too well since dad had kept most of my schooling private. Miller was here, and I found an empty seat next to him as much for it being the closest one as the quasi-familiarity we shared from both being in the same training program. It felt slightly less awkward than sitting near any of the rest of them.{&1310}\par "You ... excited to go back home?" he asked after trying a little wave with his hand. It didn't work out too well with those restrictions from the seat over his chest and shoulders, and he frowned at that. Or maybe it was the asanine question.{&1310}\par So awkward. Thank god for training.{&1310}\par I strapped in, shrugging and as indifferent as I could be. I wanted to say yes, and at the same time no. I didn't feel excited -- more unsettled than anything else. Like I'd been given a big fat boot in the ass and wasn't quite sure where I was supposed to land yet. So I just let "I don't know" fall out of my mouth. I was past ready to be out and away from here, though. Did that count?{&1310}\par I didn't really want to talk about it either way, so it worked out when he seemed to get the hint and left me alone after that. Just like everyone else.{&1310}\par {&1310}\par {&1310}\par {&1310}\par I fell asleep waiting for our shuttle to break free from the \i Soyorov\i0  so I didn't get to see it again from the outside in all its retired old glory like I had coming in half a year ago. A lifetime ago. I wondered if it would've still been so intimidating, but I didn't think so. I'd seen much more enlighteningly terrible things to be afraid of. There would be plenty more too -- for the cadets who came back.{&1310}\par The pilot roused each of us -- I wasn't the only one to pass out so easily when I finally stopped moving and had nothing to do but think and wait. Miller tried to give me another smile from one side as he went about unhooking himself from his seat. The half-hearted attempt I made back probably came off more like a grimance than anything encouraging. I worried that what Hammar had said the other day might not have entirely been a joke, and I had no idea how I should feel about that if it weren't. But I didn't want to think about it with everything else that had happened -- was happening, or not. So I ... didn't.{&1310}\par They'd extended a gangplank between the airlock in the back of the shuttle and the frigate -- the ship was nowhere near as big as the \i Soyorov \i0 and didn't have hangar bays for passenger shuttles like the carrier did. The pilot said it was supposed to ferry us back to Riftwatch. I saw it through the steelglass, hanging there in space like a finless fish with gunmounts on it. Looking back, Heat Station floated behind us. I hadn't even gotten to set foot inside this time. We were probably the only trainees that needed a gunboat to carry us back home.{&1310}\par They said things had gotten that bad, but it was hard to believe the system news reports with how subsidized by the Grand Admirals they were. And it was easy to forget inside that isolated bubble formed around us by the academy and training.{&1310}\par The lieutenant commander in charge of the frigate welcomed us formally to the ship, the \i Noybaerleen\i0 , though I'd have hardly called it much of a welcome. He kind of just gave us a curt, perfunctory permission to embark as the senior officer on board, but you could tell he didn't like us -- didn't want us there, and probably thought this "babysitting" thing was a waste of his time. Maybe it was. Either way, he dismissed both us and the shuttle pilot as quickly as humanly possible to return to his bridge, or whatever he felt was more important  just then. A junior grade lieutenant with a nervous twitch in her right eye showed us to the lower deck and then surprised us all by ordering us to change into G-Suits.{&1310}\par "Why?" I demanded, even though I knew it wouldn't change anything now that someone had made up their mind. It meant we were going to be traveling fast -- maybe even for a good reason.{&1310}\par The officer settled back into a composed rest stance, looking at me but addressing everyone when she explained. She didn't have to bother with a cadet like me, and could have even told me to shut up. I probably should have been grateful, but all I could think about was getting inside that glass, nightmare-prone prison once more.{&1310}\par "Pirate activity has been high in the region," she told us, being generous. "Skipper's ordered all crew to the tubes for the trip. And until we get to port -- that means all of you, too."{&1310}\par "Has there been another attack?" one of the other trainees -- a future grunt from the look of him -- asked, sounding excited. I'd set a bad precedent and now I wasn't the only one to speak up out of turn. Thankfully, the lieutenant seemed just a little bit patient with a bunch of kids. In spite of that nervous tick, she regarded him cooly.{&1310}\par "Don't you watch the news, recruit? Sightings," she told him. "If you want to know more than that, you're going to have to get commissioned or speculate on your own time. Now, get a move on, people!"{&1310}\par They'd come prepared with extra suits for us cadets and recruits and the lot of us quickly stripped down to our skivvies to get changed. I took the one the lieutenant handed me and started pulling it on, the whole while feeling like I'd rather just shoot myself in the head and get it over with now. The headaches and nightmares from the last trip to the field had finally just subsided earlier this week. They couldn't start up again, they just \i couldn't\i0 . Not so soon.{&1310}\par But what was I supposed to do? I could feel angry, hysterical tears burning behind my eyes and it was a struggle to keep them under control. \i Fuck\i0 . What was I supposed to do?{&1310}\par The only thing I really could. Just ... get in like every other time.{&1310}\par \i God\i0  ...{&1310}\par My body kept moving on its own, getting me dressed up in the G-suit like a robot. Thank god for training. When I was done, I lined up with the others in front of the tanks that were set aside for us. It was just the lieutenant chaperoning us here in the aft section, no on else from the crew. The officer stood there with her hands on her hips watching as us trainees got ourselves in and strapped one by one. I waited for my turn as people checked each other off and then she did too, making sure they were all hooked up right. That unsettled feeling I'd had ever since leaving Commander Delacroix's office had turned me into a taut string ready to snap down here at the claustrophobic thought of getting back inside one of those horror shows. I waited, but I could feel the tension like I would suddenly just break down and lose it any second. And I still had the self-awareness to realize how much it would ruin me to burst into tears right there in front of everyone.{&1310}\par The lieutenant rounded on me, catching me by surprise. It was my turn, and I ... had a surreal moment then, suddenly staring back at the tank meant for me. I looked at it, and couldn't help but feel like a whole in my world had suddenly opened up there where no one else could see it. I was suddenly so sure that if I got inside that tank I would just fall through and cease to exist here altogether.{&1310}\par How could I tell her that? How could I make her \i believe\i0  ...?{&1310}\par I didn't know, but I turned back to try. It didn't matter. The whole ship had gone quiet -- \i too\i0  quiet for a military ship in port getting under way. I thought it was just me. Then the overhead lights winked out.{&1310}\par Cold washed over me like ice water, prickling my skin. I froze in place. There should have been cries of surprise -- maybe even alarm -- the tanks hadn't all sealed yet, and there was the officer. But there was nothing. Just the sound of my breathing in the still air.{&1310}\par Panic.{&1310}\par A dozen thoughts raced through my head. Power failure. Sabotage. Terrorist attack on the station. The ship? I could almost imagine the sound of turbines winding down to rest or the dull thud of explosions through the bulkheads. And I could only imagine -- because there was nothing. I suddenly couldn't even sense any of those trainees who had still been waiting around me just a second ago and there was this terrified fear of absolutely everyone just being \i gone\i0 .{&1310}\par I reached a hand out, reflexively. The need to not be suddenly alone in the dark was overwhelming. Primordial. Nothing. My mind raced along, but my body was sluggish. I staggered a step back and my foot caught on someting. And the fall down to the ground seemed to last a quiet eternity there in the dark.{&1310}\par The deck was sticky. It stuck to my hand and my back.{&1310}\par Emergency lighting flashed on in dull reds, painting the black the color of blood.{&1310}\par I wasn't stupid enough to cry out. Something told me on a level I couldn't even comprehend that it would be the worst thing I could do. I could just barely see in the weak, reddish deck lights, but seeing at all made me need to move again. That same sense told me not to -- to stay put and shut up. For what? I don't know. I scrambled up instead on stupid instinct and saw the thing that had tripped me. I squinted at it for a long time before it started to look human. Human, but like the upper half had just been ripped away ... leaving only a pair of legs from the waist down ending in booted feet. That was what had tripped me.{&1310}\par I wiped a hand to my face and froze when I saw what looked like blood there. It was the light. I had to be. But it stuck between my fingers, running slowly and thickly as I watched.{&1310}\par And that was when I noticed I was surrounded by those vaguely human-looking bits and pieces. They were all around me. Everywhere. There must have been a dozen when you added them all up. More, maybe. All of them just ... torn apart.{&1310}\par Something moved. The blackness suddenly shifted, coming alive. It blotted out the emergency lights and I sucked in a startled breath, wide-eyed and terrified. It whipped back and forth like a snake while I watched, transfixed. I didn't move now, but it knew I was there. Because I had moved when I shouldn't have. It knew I was there because it launched itself right at my head.{&1310}\par I crashed back down into the deck full of sticky red blood as it smothered me. I opened my mouth to scream and it squirmed right down my throat.{&1310}\par {&1310}\par {&1310}\par {&1310}\par "Hey!"{&1310}\par My body lurched up and out of the dark and suddenly people were there with the lights back on. Hands were on me -- I threw them off. That thing was down my throat and I was choking on it. I grabbed onto that someone who was trying to hold me down and shoved them away. Only after he tumbled over backwards into the deck did I realize it was just Miller. He looked up at me with a dazed expression on his face.{&1310}\par That thing in my throat was the breathing tube. I was gagging on it, the disgusting feel of that blackness so abruptly violating me all I could think about and making me choke. I reached up and ripped it out, throwing up water on myself while I did.{&1310}\par I was slumped over in my tank, drained and leaving me soaked in proto-amniotic fluid. The other trainees had been reactivating around me, climbing out of their tubes. A few glanced my way after I threw out Mills. He picked himself up from the floor, giving me a wary look.{&1310}\par "You okay, Weir?"{&1310}\par I tried to get my breathing under control, but I was still coughing up stuff from my stomach and lungs. It was just a dream. Just a dream. I forced that thought back down my throat as hard and fast as I could too. Just another \i stupid\i0  dream - like the others. I remembered now, things coming back in a jumbled rush. I'd managed to get in and go to sleep. Then I'd started dreaming back to getting on the ship with that morbid little bit of carnage thrown in just for fun. {&1310}\par These \i fucking\i0  tubes! {&1310}\par But it hadn't felt quite the same. I wasn't there as somebody else like living through a memory or riding around on the inside of their head. This time it was me and \i just\i0  me and that place was on a ship like this one and I didn't think I--{&1310}\par "Hey! Can you even hear me? Snap out of it, Weir!" {&1310}\par Miller was back in my face. I didn't think he meant to choke me this time, but I didn't get the chance to find out because that lieutenant who'd been chaperoning us from before came running into the room behind with a live rifle clutched in her hands. I remembered standing here and getting into the tube and, at the same time, falling in the dark before I ever could. I felt like I'd fallen out of time just looking at everyone suddenly displaced along with me. Except, they acted like nothing else had happened.{&1310}\par Why did it always feel so fucking real?{&1310}\par "Move it! Move it!" the lieutenant cried at us, still in her own G-suit and dripping translucent tank sludge all over the deck. It was pretty obvious she had just hopped out and grabbed a weapon. Her blond hair had darkened in its taught ponytail. "Get out of those tanks and line up, trainees!"{&1310}\par "What the hell ..." Mills muttered as his head whipped back around. For the first time, I realized that there were yellow warning lights flashing along the seams of the bulkheads and dull-pitched klaxons droning through the air. The ship was under attack.{&1310}\par "Pirates?" someone else blurted out before they could even get in formation, frozen and looking around in awe after coming to the same conclusion as me. The lieutenant just shook her head.{&1310}\par "That's not what you need to worry about right now, recruit. Fall in!"{&1310}\par He did. But not without barking out some more.{&1310}\par "What if there's a boarding party? We need to get to the armory! Uh, ma'am!"{&1310}\par He had that nervous excitement in his popping eyes beneath a shaved head, eyeballing the officer's rifle eagerly. Some of the others were coming alive with all that too -- tank-sleep subdued by pre-battle anticipation. Because that was what they thought was happening. Months and months of training for just this sort of thing and now it was sort of just happening all of a sudden on this inconsequential little gunboat transport for a dozen boots.{&1310}\par "Shut your mouths," the woman snapped at them -- at us all -- with a warning finger, "and follow me."{&1310}\par Murmuring now. All that pro-military, fight-the-good-fight bullshit shoved down their throats this whole time abruptly vomited back up all at once. Not me -- I just felt like retching up something else entirely, though. I felt sick, that tank-dream still stuck in my head.{&1310}\par How did I know those bodies weren't there's and I wasn't some freak prophet? It had happened before. Old Haakon was supposed to have only had the ability to See -- no other psychokinetic abilities. It was how they said he had beaten the Imperials, with their limitless fleets and death drones raining down from the skies on the scattered colonies. Maybe, but it was almost funny how much wishful thinking that was. Wouldn't it be easier to just accept that I had no talent at all? I guess so. But, if it was even possible -- well, too bad my dreams were only ever about death. That couldn't have been a good thing.{&1310}\par "Don't worry," Miller said as we jogged along after the lieutenant down the ship corridor. I realized he was talking to me. The rest of the crew were coming alive and bustling about, nearly running us over. He was looking back over his shoulder at me. Nervous, but he tried to hide it.{&1310}\par God, now \i really\i0  wasn't the time.{&1310}\par We didn't end up at the armory. Instead, the lieutenant took us to the tiny mess and stuck us trainees in there while she disappeared to report to the bridge. Some of the others -- like that one guy who'd seemed so eager -- were disappointed. Pissed even. If the door hadn't been locked from the outside behind the officer, I'm pretty sure they would have done something stupid. Instead, we were just stuck.{&1310}\par Stuck in that tiny little tomb on a ship under attack. And for some reason I was the only one who seemed worried sick instead of just feeling cheated.{&1310}\par The good news was that the mess had a port looking out into space. The bad news was that there was only one and everyone was suddenly shoving their way over there to see.{&1310}\par "Where are they?"{&1310}\par "I can't see anything."{&1310}\par "Goddamnit, let me in!"{&1310}\par A couple future grunts started fighting over the prime spots, but that got broken up quick when someone stabbed an overextended finger over their heads into the glass.{&1310}\par "Look!"{&1310}\par "Is that it?"{&1310}\par "I can't fucking tell!"{&1310}\par I couldn't see either and I wasn't sure I wanted too. I stood back from that mass of excited trainees just watching them, still feeling slightly nauseous. Miller looked like he wanted to join them too, but stayed back like me. Probably thought Psychoes were better than all that useless jockeying. Hah. Maybe they were, who knew. But they should have been scared. There were some pretty damn good reasons to be.{&1310}\par I had read about this sort of thing -- we all had, during training. The pirates liked to leave improvised anti-high velocity travel devices like snares along known traffick routes between populated parts of the sector. Out here in the dark they'd catch ships helpless and get them. Not for the money, valuables, or cargo, though. Never that. Shenlizite -- that was all they ever took. The stuff they put in everything to make it work. Most ships and the crew onboard died pretty quickly once they ripped it out of the engines' fuel cells.{&1310}\par "No ensignia," someone noted.{&1310}\par "What?"{&1310}\par "They've got no ensignia -- it's gotta be pirates. Only they fly without colors out here."{&1310}\par "Who cares? It's all Tau bullshit anyways."{&1310}\par "Yeah, everyone knows they're funding the pieces of shit -- might as well be flying their banner for all it matters."{&1310}\par "I heard \i that\i0 ."{&1310}\par I didn't need to see the other ship to have a good idea what was coming our way. Maybe they hailed the captain and asked for him to surrender. Maybe they didn't. They probably didn't. All I had to wait for was the telltale rock of railgun fire. We all knew what it felt like in the simulations and somehow the real thing was still always ten times worse.{&1310}\par It was the fear.{&1310}\par The lights dimmed and the bulkheads came alive with the pervasive hum of power being redirected to ablative armor plating and weapons. We'd come in a gunship, so at least we could fight back. But that sickening wrench in my stomach from when I'd woken back up in the tank began to twist into a creeping sense of terror instead. Whatever happened -- we were helpless down here. I could see our deaths inside my head. Pitiful, hopless, and wasted.{&1310}\par "Here we go," someone said from inside that crowd of trainees squashed up against the port view. It had a reverential tone to it, like what someone might say before doing something profoundly unique for the first time. We could have been about to make a high-orbital jump, or have a first kiss. The quiet that settled over them all made the whole thing feel almost spiritual in nature.{&1310}\par I suddenly couldn't breathe.{&1310}\par Miller was muttering under his breath. "\i Screw \i0 this."{&1310}\par He twisted back around, anxious frustration twisting his face. He went at the door and pounded a fist against it. Gagging on the feel of no air in my throat, I just watched him do it.{&1310}\par "It's locked, buddy," one of the crowd peeled his eyes away from the spectacle outside just long enough to chide Mills. Another guy followed him.{&1310}\par "Fuck, man," that one elbowed the other in the arm, "he's a Psycho. You know what they can do?"{&1310}\par "Psycho-in-training," the first shook his head, but abandoned the port to keep watching Mills. His friend did too.{&1310}\par Miller had a hand reached out to the console and had closed his eyes. I think he was trying to unlock it. From the outside or inside -- I don't know. I never saw any of the other cadets manage anything more than moving simple objects around during training. The hard stuff would've come later. But that never stopped some of them from experimenting on their own late at night in the safety of their bunkrooms. Maybe ...{&1310}\par Cannon fire sounded above us, shaking the whole ship. People gasped, and I thought we'd been hit. Maybe it didn't even matter if we got out of that room -- if we were still going to be blown apart out in the middle of dead space. The ship shifted more and it happened again. But ... not a hit -- us \i firing\i0 . There was a cry of excitement and someone pounded the port window.{&1310}\par "They're not even fighting back! They're running!"{&1310}\par Those two guys watching Mills with me whipped back around, looking pissed.{&1310}\par "Damn it, we missed it!"{&1310}\par Some other guy flicked the pirate ship off through the port. "Suck on that, fucking assholes!"{&1310}\par "Look, they're fucking turning back ... god, they're running away!"{&1310}\par "Yeeeeah! Betcha didn't think it'd be a warship coming out at ya!"{&1310}\par "Fuuuck, yes."{&1310}\par And just like that ... it was over. No incoming fire. No boarding party. No real fighting.{&1310}\par Nothing.{&1310}\par Later on, the lieutenant would inform us that they had hit a snare while in HV travel -- just like I thought. The systems reactivated all hands before it even dropped back to normal speeds and the captain opened fire before the enemy ship made any attempt to communicate or attack. If they had been pirates -- and they probably had been -- they weren't counting on an armed military vessel and almost immediately retreated. She was pretty quick with assuring us that the other ship was no match for the \i Noybaerleen \i0 in a stand-up fight.{&1310}\par What she didn't think about -- or any of the other trainees for that matter -- was how easily this could have been an unarmed transport we were on -- even a year ago. The pirates hadn't been so bold with the main routes back then. No one would have thought they needed to divert an entire gunship just to ferry around some new recruits. And we all would have been dead.{&1310}\par It was why we were so lucky, but I didn't feel so good about it like all the other trainees. Neither did Mills, I could tell. We were the only two not smiling and bragging and chattering excitedly away about it the whole rest of the way to Riftwatch station.{&1310}\par He never had managed to get that door open and there was all the reason in the world to believe we would have died down there otherwise. Locked in and helpless. It wasn't the kind of thing anyone else wanted to think about when they thought about this undeclared war with the pirates.{&1310}\par Dying alone and helpless in the middle of nowhere.\cf2\f1 {&1310}\par }{&1310}

Cadets, recruits, and all the future of the Dreggoran Navy, swarmed into the old fighter bays of the \i Soyorov\i0  that now only trafficked in people and cargo, ready to fly out back home. People who'd barely seen each other in six months came flooding out of the woodwork, shouting and excited about how they had weathered the storm of training and were just about to be done and commissioned. Two weeks of home, fun, and distance were all that was left between them and the final run, and every last one of them was determined to make the best of it. It was like watching a bunch of kids who'd suddenly been told by the adults to just go run and play.

Not that grumbling back at an automated message had any point. It triggered in my personal comm because I was a second or two behind schedule in that annoyingly placid, female voice. The original architects must have meant it to sound neutral and attractive for the Grand Admirals' approval, but I swear I could always hear that faint hint of sarcasm when she had anything to say to me in particular. Oh, it was there -- I don't care what anybody might say. Tess would've thought so too. And I also liked to imagine that she'd been ugly, unlike her voice. I was probably the only one.{&1310}\par "Cadet," the shuttle pilot acknowledged as soon as I appeared in the bay. "Solansky, is it?" He barely looked up from the holopad on his arm as I stepped up to the onramp. "Come on, come on -- I'd like to get the hell off this warhorse before she decides to finally fall apart."{&1310}\par "Uh, Weir ... actually."{&1310}\par "What's that, cadet?" He did look up at me now. He was only an ensign with a boot-cut crew cut, but I could tell he took himself pretty seriously. Why did they always do that? Would I have?{&1310}\par Whatever.{&1310}\par "Cadet Weir, reporting as ordered, sir." I stiffened up and reported formally. Didn't mean I put any real heart in it, though. It was an empty gesture to steal away any ammunition a commissioned officer might use against me before I was gone again. I kind of already felt like I was, even if it wasn't physically. Yet.{&1310}\par "Weir, huh," he said, and swiped a finger across his manifest like crossing my name off a list. Then he jabbed a thumb over his shoulder. "Take a seat and get strapped in, cadet. Only got a few of you shipping out to Riftwatch, but it'll take a frigate to get you all that far. We've got forty-nine minutes to rendezvous outside the station."{&1310}\par I only sort of recognized the dozen or so other trainees I found already belted in to short-range G-seats line up in two parallel rows inside the shuttle's tiny holding bay. We'd shipped out at different times, even though all cadets had come together at Heat Station for induction. Other children of personnel from back on Riftwatch that I never really got to know too well since dad had kept most of my schooling private. Miller was here, and I found an empty seat next to him as much for it being the closest one as the quasi-familiarity we shared from both being in the same training program. It felt slightly less awkward than sitting near any of the rest of them.{&1310}\par "You ... excited to go back home?" he asked after trying a little wave with his hand. It didn't work out too well with those restrictions from the seat over his chest and shoulders, and he frowned at that. Or maybe it was the asanine question.{&1310}\par So awkward. Thank god for training.{&1310}\par I strapped in, shrugging and as indifferent as I could be. I wanted to say yes, and at the same time no. I didn't feel excited -- more unsettled than anything else. Like I'd been given a big fat boot in the ass and wasn't quite sure where I was supposed to land yet. So I just let "I don't know" fall out of my mouth. I was past ready to be out and away from here, though. Did that count?{&1310}\par I didn't really want to talk about it either way, so it worked out when he seemed to get the hint and left me alone after that. Just like everyone else.{&1310}\par {&1310}\par {&1310}\par {&1310}\par I fell asleep waiting for our shuttle to break free from the \i Soyorov\i0  so I didn't get to see it again from the outside in all its retired old glory like I had coming in half a year ago. A lifetime ago. I wondered if it would've still been so intimidating, but I didn't think so. I'd seen much more enlighteningly terrible things to be afraid of. There would be plenty more too -- for the cadets who came back.{&1310}\par The pilot roused each of us -- I wasn't the only one to pass out so easily when I finally stopped moving and had nothing to do but think and wait. Miller tried to give me another smile from one side as he went about unhooking himself from his seat. The half-hearted attempt I made back probably came off more like a grimance than anything encouraging. I worried that what Hammar had said the other day might not have entirely been a joke, and I had no idea how I should feel about that if it weren't. But I didn't want to think about it with everything else that had happened -- was happening, or not. So I ... didn't.{&1310}\par They'd extended a gangplank between the airlock in the back of the shuttle and the frigate -- the ship was nowhere near as big as the \i Soyorov \i0 and didn't have hangar bays for passenger shuttles like the carrier did. The pilot said it was supposed to ferry us back to Riftwatch. I saw it through the steelglass, hanging there in space like a finless fish with gunmounts on it. Looking back, Heat Station floated behind us. I hadn't even gotten to set foot inside this time. We were probably the only trainees that needed a gunboat to carry us back home.{&1310}\par They said things had gotten that bad, but it was hard to believe the system news reports with how subsidized by the Grand Admirals they were. And it was easy to forget inside that isolated bubble formed around us by the academy and training.{&1310}\par The lieutenant commander in charge of the frigate welcomed us formally to the ship, the \i Noybaerleen\i0 , though I'd have hardly called it much of a welcome. He kind of just gave us a curt, perfunctory permission to embark as the senior officer on board, but you could tell he didn't like us -- didn't want us there, and probably thought this "babysitting" thing was a waste of his time. Maybe it was. Either way, he dismissed both us and the shuttle pilot as quickly as humanly possible to return to his bridge, or whatever he felt was more important  just then. A junior grade lieutenant with a nervous twitch in her right eye showed us to the lower deck and then surprised us all by ordering us to change into G-Suits.{&1310}\par "Why?" I demanded, even though I knew it wouldn't change anything now that someone had made up their mind. It meant we were going to be traveling fast -- maybe even for a good reason.{&1310}\par The officer settled back into a composed rest stance, looking at me but addressing everyone when she explained. She didn't have to bother with a cadet like me, and could have even told me to shut up. I probably should have been grateful, but all I could think about was getting inside that glass, nightmare-prone prison once more.{&1310}\par "Pirate activity has been high in the region," she told us, being generous. "Skipper's ordered all crew to the tubes for the trip. And until we get to port -- that means all of you, too."{&1310}\par "Has there been another attack?" one of the other trainees -- a future grunt from the look of him -- asked, sounding excited. I'd set a bad precedent and now I wasn't the only one to speak up out of turn. Thankfully, the lieutenant seemed just a little bit patient with a bunch of kids. In spite of that nervous tick, she regarded him cooly.{&1310}\par "Don't you watch the news, recruit? Sightings," she told him. "If you want to know more than that, you're going to have to get commissioned or speculate on your own time. Now, get a move on, people!"{&1310}\par They'd come prepared with extra suits for us cadets and recruits and the lot of us quickly stripped down to our skivvies to get changed. I took the one the lieutenant handed me and started pulling it on, the whole while feeling like I'd rather just shoot myself in the head and get it over with now. The headaches and nightmares from the last trip to the field had finally just subsided earlier this week. They couldn't start up again, they just \i couldn't\i0 . Not so soon.{&1310}\par But what was I supposed to do? I could feel angry, hysterical tears burning behind my eyes and it was a struggle to keep them under control. \i Fuck\i0 . What was I supposed to do?{&1310}\par The only thing I really could. Just ... get in like every other time.{&1310}\par \i God\i0  ...{&1310}\par My body kept moving on its own, getting me dressed up in the G-suit like a robot. Thank god for training. When I was done, I lined up with the others in front of the tanks that were set aside for us. It was just the lieutenant chaperoning us here in the aft section, no on else from the crew. The officer stood there with her hands on her hips watching as us trainees got ourselves in and strapped one by one. I waited for my turn as people checked each other off and then she did too, making sure they were all hooked up right. That unsettled feeling I'd had ever since leaving Commander Delacroix's office had turned me into a taut string ready to snap down here at the claustrophobic thought of getting back inside one of those horror shows. I waited, but I could feel the tension like I would suddenly just break down and lose it any second. And I still had the self-awareness to realize how much it would ruin me to burst into tears right there in front of everyone.{&1310}\par The lieutenant rounded on me, catching me by surprise. It was my turn, and I ... had a surreal moment then, suddenly staring back at the tank meant for me. I looked at it, and couldn't help but feel like a whole in my world had suddenly opened up there where no one else could see it. I was suddenly so sure that if I got inside that tank I would just fall through and cease to exist here altogether.{&1310}\par How could I tell her that? How could I make her \i believe\i0  ...?{&1310}\par I didn't know, but I turned back to try. It didn't matter. The whole ship had gone quiet -- \i too\i0  quiet for a military ship in port getting under way. I thought it was just me. Then the overhead lights winked out.{&1310}\par Cold washed over me like ice water, prickling my skin. I froze in place. There should have been cries of surprise -- maybe even alarm -- the tanks hadn't all sealed yet, and there was the officer. But there was nothing. Just the sound of my breathing in the still air.{&1310}\par Panic.{&1310}\par A dozen thoughts raced through my head. Power failure. Sabotage. Terrorist attack on the station. The ship? I could almost imagine the sound of turbines winding down to rest or the dull thud of explosions through the bulkheads. And I could only imagine -- because there was nothing. I suddenly couldn't even sense any of those trainees who had still been waiting around me just a second ago and there was this terrified fear of absolutely everyone just being \i gone\i0 .{&1310}\par I reached a hand out, reflexively. The need to not be suddenly alone in the dark was overwhelming. Primordial. Nothing. My mind raced along, but my body was sluggish. I staggered a step back and my foot caught on someting. And the fall down to the ground seemed to last a quiet eternity there in the dark.{&1310}\par The deck was sticky. It stuck to my hand and my back.{&1310}\par Emergency lighting flashed on in dull reds, painting the black the color of blood.{&1310}\par I wasn't stupid enough to cry out. Something told me on a level I couldn't even comprehend that it would be the worst thing I could do. I could just barely see in the weak, reddish deck lights, but seeing at all made me need to move again. That same sense told me not to -- to stay put and shut up. For what? I don't know. I scrambled up instead on stupid instinct and saw the thing that had tripped me. I squinted at it for a long time before it started to look human. Human, but like the upper half had just been ripped away ... leaving only a pair of legs from the waist down ending in booted feet. That was what had tripped me.{&1310}\par I wiped a hand to my face and froze when I saw what looked like blood there. It was the light. I had to be. But it stuck between my fingers, running slowly and thickly as I watched.{&1310}\par And that was when I noticed I was surrounded by those vaguely human-looking bits and pieces. They were all around me. Everywhere. There must have been a dozen when you added them all up. More, maybe. All of them just ... torn apart.{&1310}\par Something moved. The blackness suddenly shifted, coming alive. It blotted out the emergency lights and I sucked in a startled breath, wide-eyed and terrified. It whipped back and forth like a snake while I watched, transfixed. I didn't move now, but it knew I was there. Because I had moved when I shouldn't have. It knew I was there because it launched itself right at my head.{&1310}\par I crashed back down into the deck full of sticky red blood as it smothered me. I opened my mouth to scream and it squirmed right down my throat.{&1310}\par {&1310}\par {&1310}\par {&1310}\par "Hey!"{&1310}\par My body lurched up and out of the dark and suddenly people were there with the lights back on. Hands were on me -- I threw them off. That thing was down my throat and I was choking on it. I grabbed onto that someone who was trying to hold me down and shoved them away. Only after he tumbled over backwards into the deck did I realize it was just Miller. He looked up at me with a dazed expression on his face.{&1310}\par That thing in my throat was the breathing tube. I was gagging on it, the disgusting feel of that blackness so abruptly violating me all I could think about and making me choke. I reached up and ripped it out, throwing up water on myself while I did.{&1310}\par I was slumped over in my tank, drained and leaving me soaked in proto-amniotic fluid. The other trainees had been reactivating around me, climbing out of their tubes. A few glanced my way after I threw out Mills. He picked himself up from the floor, giving me a wary look.{&1310}\par "You okay, Weir?"{&1310}\par I tried to get my breathing under control, but I was still coughing up stuff from my stomach and lungs. It was just a dream. Just a dream. I forced that thought back down my throat as hard and fast as I could too. Just another \i stupid\i0  dream - like the others. I remembered now, things coming back in a jumbled rush. I'd managed to get in and go to sleep. Then I'd started dreaming back to getting on the ship with that morbid little bit of carnage thrown in just for fun. {&1310}\par These \i fucking\i0  tubes! {&1310}\par But it hadn't felt quite the same. I wasn't there as somebody else like living through a memory or riding around on the inside of their head. This time it was me and \i just\i0  me and that place was on a ship like this one and I didn't think I--{&1310}\par "Hey! Can you even hear me? Snap out of it, Weir!" {&1310}\par Miller was back in my face. I didn't think he meant to choke me this time, but I didn't get the chance to find out because that lieutenant who'd been chaperoning us from before came running into the room behind with a live rifle clutched in her hands. I remembered standing here and getting into the tube and, at the same time, falling in the dark before I ever could. I felt like I'd fallen out of time just looking at everyone suddenly displaced along with me. Except, they acted like nothing else had happened.{&1310}\par Why did it always feel so fucking real?{&1310}\par "Move it! Move it!" the lieutenant cried at us, still in her own G-suit and dripping translucent tank sludge all over the deck. It was pretty obvious she had just hopped out and grabbed a weapon. Her blond hair had darkened in its taught ponytail. "Get out of those tanks and line up, trainees!"{&1310}\par "What the hell ..." Mills muttered as his head whipped back around. For the first time, I realized that there were yellow warning lights flashing along the seams of the bulkheads and dull-pitched klaxons droning through the air. The ship was under attack.{&1310}\par "Pirates?" someone else blurted out before they could even get in formation, frozen and looking around in awe after coming to the same conclusion as me. The lieutenant just shook her head.{&1310}\par "That's not what you need to worry about right now, recruit. Fall in!"{&1310}\par He did. But not without barking out some more.{&1310}\par "What if there's a boarding party? We need to get to the armory! Uh, ma'am!"{&1310}\par He had that nervous excitement in his popping eyes beneath a shaved head, eyeballing the officer's rifle eagerly. Some of the others were coming alive with all that too -- tank-sleep subdued by pre-battle anticipation. Because that was what they thought was happening. Months and months of training for just this sort of thing and now it was sort of just happening all of a sudden on this inconsequential little gunboat transport for a dozen boots.{&1310}\par "Shut your mouths," the woman snapped at them -- at us all -- with a warning finger, "and follow me."{&1310}\par Murmuring now. All that pro-military, fight-the-good-fight bullshit shoved down their throats this whole time abruptly vomited back up all at once. Not me -- I just felt like retching up something else entirely, though. I felt sick, that tank-dream still stuck in my head.{&1310}\par How did I know those bodies weren't there's and I wasn't some freak prophet? It had happened before. Old Haakon was supposed to have only had the ability to See -- no other psychokinetic abilities. It was how they said he had beaten the Imperials, with their limitless fleets and death drones raining down from the skies on the scattered colonies. Maybe, but it was almost funny how much wishful thinking that was. Wouldn't it be easier to just accept that I had no talent at all? I guess so. But, if it was even possible -- well, too bad my dreams were only ever about death. That couldn't have been a good thing.{&1310}\par "Don't worry," Miller said as we jogged along after the lieutenant down the ship corridor. I realized he was talking to me. The rest of the crew were coming alive and bustling about, nearly running us over. He was looking back over his shoulder at me. Nervous, but he tried to hide it.{&1310}\par God, now \i really\i0  wasn't the time.{&1310}\par We didn't end up at the armory. Instead, the lieutenant took us to the tiny mess and stuck us trainees in there while she disappeared to report to the bridge. Some of the others -- like that one guy who'd seemed so eager -- were disappointed. Pissed even. If the door hadn't been locked from the outside behind the officer, I'm pretty sure they would have done something stupid. Instead, we were just stuck.{&1310}\par Stuck in that tiny little tomb on a ship under attack. And for some reason I was the only one who seemed worried sick instead of just feeling cheated.{&1310}\par The good news was that the mess had a port looking out into space. The bad news was that there was only one and everyone was suddenly shoving their way over there to see.{&1310}\par "Where are they?"{&1310}\par "I can't see anything."{&1310}\par "Goddamnit, let me in!"{&1310}\par A couple future grunts started fighting over the prime spots, but that got broken up quick when someone stabbed an overextended finger over their heads into the glass.{&1310}\par "Look!"{&1310}\par "Is that it?"{&1310}\par "I can't fucking tell!"{&1310}\par I couldn't see either and I wasn't sure I wanted too. I stood back from that mass of excited trainees just watching them, still feeling slightly nauseous. Miller looked like he wanted to join them too, but stayed back like me. Probably thought Psychoes were better than all that useless jockeying. Hah. Maybe they were, who knew. But they should have been scared. There were some pretty damn good reasons to be.{&1310}\par I had read about this sort of thing -- we all had, during training. The pirates liked to leave improvised anti-high velocity travel devices like snares along known traffick routes between populated parts of the sector. Out here in the dark they'd catch ships helpless and get them. Not for the money, valuables, or cargo, though. Never that. Shenlizite -- that was all they ever took. The stuff they put in everything to make it work. Most ships and the crew onboard died pretty quickly once they ripped it out of the engines' fuel cells.{&1310}\par "No ensignia," someone noted.{&1310}\par "What?"{&1310}\par "They've got no ensignia -- it's gotta be pirates. Only they fly without colors out here."{&1310}\par "Who cares? It's all Tau bullshit anyways."{&1310}\par "Yeah, everyone knows they're funding the pieces of shit -- might as well be flying their banner for all it matters."{&1310}\par "I heard \i that\i0 ."{&1310}\par I didn't need to see the other ship to have a good idea what was coming our way. Maybe they hailed the captain and asked for him to surrender. Maybe they didn't. They probably didn't. All I had to wait for was the telltale rock of railgun fire. We all knew what it felt like in the simulations and somehow the real thing was still always ten times worse.{&1310}\par It was the fear.{&1310}\par The lights dimmed and the bulkheads came alive with the pervasive hum of power being redirected to ablative armor plating and weapons. We'd come in a gunship, so at least we could fight back. But that sickening wrench in my stomach from when I'd woken back up in the tank began to twist into a creeping sense of terror instead. Whatever happened -- we were helpless down here. I could see our deaths inside my head. Pitiful, hopless, and wasted.{&1310}\par "Here we go," someone said from inside that crowd of trainees squashed up against the port view. It had a reverential tone to it, like what someone might say before doing something profoundly unique for the first time. We could have been about to make a high-orbital jump, or have a first kiss. The quiet that settled over them all made the whole thing feel almost spiritual in nature.{&1310}\par I suddenly couldn't breathe.{&1310}\par Miller was muttering under his breath. "\i Screw \i0 this."{&1310}\par He twisted back around, anxious frustration twisting his face. He went at the door and pounded a fist against it. Gagging on the feel of no air in my throat, I just watched him do it.{&1310}\par "It's locked, buddy," one of the crowd peeled his eyes away from the spectacle outside just long enough to chide Mills. Another guy followed him.{&1310}\par "Fuck, man," that one elbowed the other in the arm, "he's a Psycho. You know what they can do?"{&1310}\par "Psycho-in-training," the first shook his head, but abandoned the port to keep watching Mills. His friend did too.{&1310}\par Miller had a hand reached out to the console and had closed his eyes. I think he was trying to unlock it. From the outside or inside -- I don't know. I never saw any of the other cadets manage anything more than moving simple objects around during training. The hard stuff would've come later. But that never stopped some of them from experimenting on their own late at night in the safety of their bunkrooms. Maybe ...{&1310}\par Cannon fire sounded above us, shaking the whole ship. People gasped, and I thought we'd been hit. Maybe it didn't even matter if we got out of that room -- if we were still going to be blown apart out in the middle of dead space. The ship shifted more and it happened again. But ... not a hit -- us \i firing\i0 . There was a cry of excitement and someone pounded the port window.{&1310}\par "They're not even fighting back! They're running!"{&1310}\par Those two guys watching Mills with me whipped back around, looking pissed.{&1310}\par "Damn it, we missed it!"{&1310}\par Some other guy flicked the pirate ship off through the port. "Suck on that, fucking assholes!"{&1310}\par "Look, they're fucking turning back ... god, they're running away!"{&1310}\par "Yeeeeah! Betcha didn't think it'd be a warship coming out at ya!"{&1310}\par "Fuuuck, yes."{&1310}\par And just like that ... it was over. No incoming fire. No boarding party. No real fighting.{&1310}\par Nothing.{&1310}\par Later on, the lieutenant would inform us that they had hit a snare while in HV travel -- just like I thought. The systems reactivated all hands before it even dropped back to normal speeds and the captain opened fire before the enemy ship made any attempt to communicate or attack. If they had been pirates -- and they probably had been -- they weren't counting on an armed military vessel and almost immediately retreated. She was pretty quick with assuring us that the other ship was no match for the \i Noybaerleen \i0 in a stand-up fight.{&1310}\par What she didn't think about -- or any of the other trainees for that matter -- was how easily this could have been an unarmed transport we were on -- even a year ago. The pirates hadn't been so bold with the main routes back then. No one would have thought they needed to divert an entire gunship just to ferry around some new recruits. And we all would have been dead.{&1310}\par It was why we were so lucky, but I didn't feel so good about it like all the other trainees. Neither did Mills, I could tell. We were the only two not smiling and bragging and chattering excitedly away about it the whole rest of the way to Riftwatch station.{&1310}\par He never had managed to get that door open and there was all the reason in the world to believe we would have died down there otherwise. Locked in and helpless. It wasn't the kind of thing anyone else wanted to think about when they thought about this undeclared war with the pirates.{&1310}\par Dying alone and helpless in the middle of nowhere.\cf2\f1 {&1310}\par }{&1310}

It still looked like it must have in the Imperial days hundreds of years ago when it was a waypoint for pretty much all of the Helium-3 mining in the system. You could see the old, abbreviated name emblazoned on the sides of the docking pylons: HE3T - Helium-3 Transfer station. Heet. \i Heat\i0 . They'd kept that dumb pun but spaced the Empire when the Grand Admirals originally converted it into a command and supply port for the Dreggoran Navy. And that was way back after they'd just finished winning the first victories for independence against the old Empire.{&1310}\par They had liked to drone on and on about that kind of thing throughout training. Heritage. Tradition. I guess we were supposed to take some sort of pride in becoming something bigger than just ourselves. Too bad it had to make you feel so small and insignificant to do that. But I think that was part of the point.{&1310}\par We had our leave assignments. Cadets, recruits, and all the future of the Dreggoran Navy, swarmed into the old fighter bays of the \i Soyorov\i0  that now only trafficked in people and cargo, ready to fly out back home. People who'd barely seen each other in six months came flooding out of the woodwork, shouting and excited about how they had weathered the storm of training and were just about to be done and commissioned. Two weeks of home, fun, and distance were all that was left between them and the final run, and every last one of them was determined to make the best of it. It was like watching a bunch of kids who'd suddenly been told by the adults to just go run and play. This was their bachelor's party before getting married to the Grand Admirals for the rest of their adult lives. I guess I was the only one getting cold feet.{&1310}\par "Cadet Evelyn Weir. Report to Shuttle 9419B in Bay 23."{&1310}\par "I'm already here," I muttered under by breath as I stepped up to the big hangar doors leading into Bay 23. Not that grumbling back at an automated message had any point. It triggered in my personal comm because I was a second or two behind schedule in that annoyingly placid, female voice. The original architects must have meant it to sound neutral and attractive for the Grand Admirals' approval, but I swear I could always hear that faint hint of sarcasm when she had anything to say to me in particular. Oh, it was there -- I don't care what anybody might say. Tess would've thought so too. And I also liked to imagine that she'd been ugly, unlike her voice. I was probably the only one.{&1310}\par "Cadet," the shuttle pilot acknowledged as soon as I appeared in the bay. "Solansky, is it?" He barely looked up from the holopad on his arm as I stepped up to the onramp. "Come on, come on -- I'd like to get the hell off this warhorse before she decides to finally fall apart."{&1310}\par "Uh, Weir ... actually."{&1310}\par "What's that, cadet?" He did look up at me now. He was only an ensign with a boot-cut crew cut, but I could tell he took himself pretty seriously. Why did they always do that? Would I have?{&1310}\par Whatever.{&1310}\par "Cadet Weir, reporting as ordered, sir." I stiffened up and reported formally. Didn't mean I put any real heart in it, though. It was an empty gesture to steal away any ammunition a commissioned officer might use against me before I was gone again. I kind of already felt like I was, even if it wasn't physically. Yet.{&1310}\par "Weir, huh," he said, and swiped a finger across his manifest like crossing my name off a list. Then he jabbed a thumb over his shoulder. "Take a seat and get strapped in, cadet. Only got a few of you shipping out to Riftwatch, but it'll take a frigate to get you all that far. We've got forty-nine minutes to rendezvous outside the station."{&1310}\par I only sort of recognized the dozen or so other trainees I found already belted in to short-range G-seats line up in two parallel rows inside the shuttle's tiny holding bay. We'd shipped out at different times, even though all cadets had come together at Heat Station for induction. Other children of personnel from back on Riftwatch that I never really got to know too well since dad had kept most of my schooling private. Miller was here, and I found an empty seat next to him as much for it being the closest one as the quasi-familiarity we shared from both being in the same training program. It felt slightly less awkward than sitting near any of the rest of them.{&1310}\par "You ... excited to go back home?" he asked after trying a little wave with his hand. It didn't work out too well with those restrictions from the seat over his chest and shoulders, and he frowned at that. Or maybe it was the asanine question.{&1310}\par So awkward. Thank god for training.{&1310}\par I strapped in, shrugging and as indifferent as I could be. I wanted to say yes, and at the same time no. I didn't feel excited -- more unsettled than anything else. Like I'd been given a big fat boot in the ass and wasn't quite sure where I was supposed to land yet. So I just let "I don't know" fall out of my mouth. I was past ready to be out and away from here, though. Did that count?{&1310}\par I didn't really want to talk about it either way, so it worked out when he seemed to get the hint and left me alone after that. Just like everyone else.{&1310}\par {&1310}\par {&1310}\par {&1310}\par I fell asleep waiting for our shuttle to break free from the \i Soyorov\i0  so I didn't get to see it again from the outside in all its retired old glory like I had coming in half a year ago. A lifetime ago. I wondered if it would've still been so intimidating, but I didn't think so. I'd seen much more enlighteningly terrible things to be afraid of. There would be plenty more too -- for the cadets who came back.{&1310}\par The pilot roused each of us -- I wasn't the only one to pass out so easily when I finally stopped moving and had nothing to do but think and wait. Miller tried to give me another smile from one side as he went about unhooking himself from his seat. The half-hearted attempt I made back probably came off more like a grimance than anything encouraging. I worried that what Hammar had said the other day might not have entirely been a joke, and I had no idea how I should feel about that if it weren't. But I didn't want to think about it with everything else that had happened -- was happening, or not. So I ... didn't.{&1310}\par They'd extended a gangplank between the airlock in the back of the shuttle and the frigate -- the ship was nowhere near as big as the \i Soyorov \i0 and didn't have hangar bays for passenger shuttles like the carrier did. The pilot said it was supposed to ferry us back to Riftwatch. I saw it through the steelglass, hanging there in space like a finless fish with gunmounts on it. Looking back, Heat Station floated behind us. I hadn't even gotten to set foot inside this time. We were probably the only trainees that needed a gunboat to carry us back home.{&1310}\par They said things had gotten that bad, but it was hard to believe the system news reports with how subsidized by the Grand Admirals they were. And it was easy to forget inside that isolated bubble formed around us by the academy and training.{&1310}\par The lieutenant commander in charge of the frigate welcomed us formally to the ship, the \i Noybaerleen\i0 , though I'd have hardly called it much of a welcome. He kind of just gave us a curt, perfunctory permission to embark as the senior officer on board, but you could tell he didn't like us -- didn't want us there, and probably thought this "babysitting" thing was a waste of his time. Maybe it was. Either way, he dismissed both us and the shuttle pilot as quickly as humanly possible to return to his bridge, or whatever he felt was more important  just then. A junior grade lieutenant with a nervous twitch in her right eye showed us to the lower deck and then surprised us all by ordering us to change into G-Suits.{&1310}\par "Why?" I demanded, even though I knew it wouldn't change anything now that someone had made up their mind. It meant we were going to be traveling fast -- maybe even for a good reason.{&1310}\par The officer settled back into a composed rest stance, looking at me but addressing everyone when she explained. She didn't have to bother with a cadet like me, and could have even told me to shut up. I probably should have been grateful, but all I could think about was getting inside that glass, nightmare-prone prison once more.{&1310}\par "Pirate activity has been high in the region," she told us, being generous. "Skipper's ordered all crew to the tubes for the trip. And until we get to port -- that means all of you, too."{&1310}\par "Has there been another attack?" one of the other trainees -- a future grunt from the look of him -- asked, sounding excited. I'd set a bad precedent and now I wasn't the only one to speak up out of turn. Thankfully, the lieutenant seemed just a little bit patient with a bunch of kids. In spite of that nervous tick, she regarded him cooly.{&1310}\par "Don't you watch the news, recruit? Sightings," she told him. "If you want to know more than that, you're going to have to get commissioned or speculate on your own time. Now, get a move on, people!"{&1310}\par They'd come prepared with extra suits for us cadets and recruits and the lot of us quickly stripped down to our skivvies to get changed. I took the one the lieutenant handed me and started pulling it on, the whole while feeling like I'd rather just shoot myself in the head and get it over with now. The headaches and nightmares from the last trip to the field had finally just subsided earlier this week. They couldn't start up again, they just \i couldn't\i0 . Not so soon.{&1310}\par But what was I supposed to do? I could feel angry, hysterical tears burning behind my eyes and it was a struggle to keep them under control. \i Fuck\i0 . What was I supposed to do?{&1310}\par The only thing I really could. Just ... get in like every other time.{&1310}\par \i God\i0  ...{&1310}\par My body kept moving on its own, getting me dressed up in the G-suit like a robot. Thank god for training. When I was done, I lined up with the others in front of the tanks that were set aside for us. It was just the lieutenant chaperoning us here in the aft section, no on else from the crew. The officer stood there with her hands on her hips watching as us trainees got ourselves in and strapped one by one. I waited for my turn as people checked each other off and then she did too, making sure they were all hooked up right. That unsettled feeling I'd had ever since leaving Commander Delacroix's office had turned me into a taut string ready to snap down here at the claustrophobic thought of getting back inside one of those horror shows. I waited, but I could feel the tension like I would suddenly just break down and lose it any second. And I still had the self-awareness to realize how much it would ruin me to burst into tears right there in front of everyone.{&1310}\par The lieutenant rounded on me, catching me by surprise. It was my turn, and I ... had a surreal moment then, suddenly staring back at the tank meant for me. I looked at it, and couldn't help but feel like a whole in my world had suddenly opened up there where no one else could see it. I was suddenly so sure that if I got inside that tank I would just fall through and cease to exist here altogether.{&1310}\par How could I tell her that? How could I make her \i believe\i0  ...?{&1310}\par I didn't know, but I turned back to try. It didn't matter. The whole ship had gone quiet -- \i too\i0  quiet for a military ship in port getting under way. I thought it was just me. Then the overhead lights winked out.{&1310}\par Cold washed over me like ice water, prickling my skin. I froze in place. There should have been cries of surprise -- maybe even alarm -- the tanks hadn't all sealed yet, and there was the officer. But there was nothing. Just the sound of my breathing in the still air.{&1310}\par Panic.{&1310}\par A dozen thoughts raced through my head. Power failure. Sabotage. Terrorist attack on the station. The ship? I could almost imagine the sound of turbines winding down to rest or the dull thud of explosions through the bulkheads. And I could only imagine -- because there was nothing. I suddenly couldn't even sense any of those trainees who had still been waiting around me just a second ago and there was this terrified fear of absolutely everyone just being \i gone\i0 .{&1310}\par I reached a hand out, reflexively. The need to not be suddenly alone in the dark was overwhelming. Primordial. Nothing. My mind raced along, but my body was sluggish. I staggered a step back and my foot caught on someting. And the fall down to the ground seemed to last a quiet eternity there in the dark.{&1310}\par The deck was sticky. It stuck to my hand and my back.{&1310}\par Emergency lighting flashed on in dull reds, painting the black the color of blood.{&1310}\par I wasn't stupid enough to cry out. Something told me on a level I couldn't even comprehend that it would be the worst thing I could do. I could just barely see in the weak, reddish deck lights, but seeing at all made me need to move again. That same sense told me not to -- to stay put and shut up. For what? I don't know. I scrambled up instead on stupid instinct and saw the thing that had tripped me. I squinted at it for a long time before it started to look human. Human, but like the upper half had just been ripped away ... leaving only a pair of legs from the waist down ending in booted feet. That was what had tripped me.{&1310}\par I wiped a hand to my face and froze when I saw what looked like blood there. It was the light. I had to be. But it stuck between my fingers, running slowly and thickly as I watched.{&1310}\par And that was when I noticed I was surrounded by those vaguely human-looking bits and pieces. They were all around me. Everywhere. There must have been a dozen when you added them all up. More, maybe. All of them just ... torn apart.{&1310}\par Something moved. The blackness suddenly shifted, coming alive. It blotted out the emergency lights and I sucked in a startled breath, wide-eyed and terrified. It whipped back and forth like a snake while I watched, transfixed. I didn't move now, but it knew I was there. Because I had moved when I shouldn't have. It knew I was there because it launched itself right at my head.{&1310}\par I crashed back down into the deck full of sticky red blood as it smothered me. I opened my mouth to scream and it squirmed right down my throat.{&1310}\par {&1310}\par {&1310}\par {&1310}\par "Hey!"{&1310}\par My body lurched up and out of the dark and suddenly people were there with the lights back on. Hands were on me -- I threw them off. That thing was down my throat and I was choking on it. I grabbed onto that someone who was trying to hold me down and shoved them away. Only after he tumbled over backwards into the deck did I realize it was just Miller. He looked up at me with a dazed expression on his face.{&1310}\par That thing in my throat was the breathing tube. I was gagging on it, the disgusting feel of that blackness so abruptly violating me all I could think about and making me choke. I reached up and ripped it out, throwing up water on myself while I did.{&1310}\par I was slumped over in my tank, drained and leaving me soaked in proto-amniotic fluid. The other trainees had been reactivating around me, climbing out of their tubes. A few glanced my way after I threw out Mills. He picked himself up from the floor, giving me a wary look.{&1310}\par "You okay, Weir?"{&1310}\par I tried to get my breathing under control, but I was still coughing up stuff from my stomach and lungs. It was just a dream. Just a dream. I forced that thought back down my throat as hard and fast as I could too. Just another \i stupid\i0  dream - like the others. I remembered now, things coming back in a jumbled rush. I'd managed to get in and go to sleep. Then I'd started dreaming back to getting on the ship with that morbid little bit of carnage thrown in just for fun. {&1310}\par These \i fucking\i0  tubes! {&1310}\par But it hadn't felt quite the same. I wasn't there as somebody else like living through a memory or riding around on the inside of their head. This time it was me and \i just\i0  me and that place was on a ship like this one and I didn't think I--{&1310}\par "Hey! Can you even hear me? Snap out of it, Weir!" {&1310}\par Miller was back in my face. I didn't think he meant to choke me this time, but I didn't get the chance to find out because that lieutenant who'd been chaperoning us from before came running into the room behind with a live rifle clutched in her hands. I remembered standing here and getting into the tube and, at the same time, falling in the dark before I ever could. I felt like I'd fallen out of time just looking at everyone suddenly displaced along with me. Except, they acted like nothing else had happened.{&1310}\par Why did it always feel so fucking real?{&1310}\par "Move it! Move it!" the lieutenant cried at us, still in her own G-suit and dripping translucent tank sludge all over the deck. It was pretty obvious she had just hopped out and grabbed a weapon. Her blond hair had darkened in its taught ponytail. "Get out of those tanks and line up, trainees!"{&1310}\par "What the hell ..." Mills muttered as his head whipped back around. For the first time, I realized that there were yellow warning lights flashing along the seams of the bulkheads and dull-pitched klaxons droning through the air. The ship was under attack.{&1310}\par "Pirates?" someone else blurted out before they could even get in formation, frozen and looking around in awe after coming to the same conclusion as me. The lieutenant just shook her head.{&1310}\par "That's not what you need to worry about right now, recruit. Fall in!"{&1310}\par He did. But not without barking out some more.{&1310}\par "What if there's a boarding party? We need to get to the armory! Uh, ma'am!"{&1310}\par He had that nervous excitement in his popping eyes beneath a shaved head, eyeballing the officer's rifle eagerly. Some of the others were coming alive with all that too -- tank-sleep subdued by pre-battle anticipation. Because that was what they thought was happening. Months and months of training for just this sort of thing and now it was sort of just happening all of a sudden on this inconsequential little gunboat transport for a dozen boots.{&1310}\par "Shut your mouths," the woman snapped at them -- at us all -- with a warning finger, "and follow me."{&1310}\par Murmuring now. All that pro-military, fight-the-good-fight bullshit shoved down their throats this whole time abruptly vomited back up all at once. Not me -- I just felt like retching up something else entirely, though. I felt sick, that tank-dream still stuck in my head.{&1310}\par How did I know those bodies weren't there's and I wasn't some freak prophet? It had happened before. Old Haakon was supposed to have only had the ability to See -- no other psychokinetic abilities. It was how they said he had beaten the Imperials, with their limitless fleets and death drones raining down from the skies on the scattered colonies. Maybe, but it was almost funny how much wishful thinking that was. Wouldn't it be easier to just accept that I had no talent at all? I guess so. But, if it was even possible -- well, too bad my dreams were only ever about death. That couldn't have been a good thing.{&1310}\par "Don't worry," Miller said as we jogged along after the lieutenant down the ship corridor. I realized he was talking to me. The rest of the crew were coming alive and bustling about, nearly running us over. He was looking back over his shoulder at me. Nervous, but he tried to hide it.{&1310}\par God, now \i really\i0  wasn't the time.{&1310}\par We didn't end up at the armory. Instead, the lieutenant took us to the tiny mess and stuck us trainees in there while she disappeared to report to the bridge. Some of the others -- like that one guy who'd seemed so eager -- were disappointed. Pissed even. If the door hadn't been locked from the outside behind the officer, I'm pretty sure they would have done something stupid. Instead, we were just stuck.{&1310}\par Stuck in that tiny little tomb on a ship under attack. And for some reason I was the only one who seemed worried sick instead of just feeling cheated.{&1310}\par The good news was that the mess had a port looking out into space. The bad news was that there was only one and everyone was suddenly shoving their way over there to see.{&1310}\par "Where are they?"{&1310}\par "I can't see anything."{&1310}\par "Goddamnit, let me in!"{&1310}\par A couple future grunts started fighting over the prime spots, but that got broken up quick when someone stabbed an overextended finger over their heads into the glass.{&1310}\par "Look!"{&1310}\par "Is that it?"{&1310}\par "I can't fucking tell!"{&1310}\par I couldn't see either and I wasn't sure I wanted too. I stood back from that mass of excited trainees just watching them, still feeling slightly nauseous. Miller looked like he wanted to join them too, but stayed back like me. Probably thought Psychoes were better than all that useless jockeying. Hah. Maybe they were, who knew. But they should have been scared. There were some pretty damn good reasons to be.{&1310}\par I had read about this sort of thing -- we all had, during training. The pirates liked to leave improvised anti-high velocity travel devices like snares along known traffick routes between populated parts of the sector. Out here in the dark they'd catch ships helpless and get them. Not for the money, valuables, or cargo, though. Never that. Shenlizite -- that was all they ever took. The stuff they put in everything to make it work. Most ships and the crew onboard died pretty quickly once they ripped it out of the engines' fuel cells.{&1310}\par "No ensignia," someone noted.{&1310}\par "What?"{&1310}\par "They've got no ensignia -- it's gotta be pirates. Only they fly without colors out here."{&1310}\par "Who cares? It's all Tau bullshit anyways."{&1310}\par "Yeah, everyone knows they're funding the pieces of shit -- might as well be flying their banner for all it matters."{&1310}\par "I heard \i that\i0 ."{&1310}\par I didn't need to see the other ship to have a good idea what was coming our way. Maybe they hailed the captain and asked for him to surrender. Maybe they didn't. They probably didn't. All I had to wait for was the telltale rock of railgun fire. We all knew what it felt like in the simulations and somehow the real thing was still always ten times worse.{&1310}\par It was the fear.{&1310}\par The lights dimmed and the bulkheads came alive with the pervasive hum of power being redirected to ablative armor plating and weapons. We'd come in a gunship, so at least we could fight back. But that sickening wrench in my stomach from when I'd woken back up in the tank began to twist into a creeping sense of terror instead. Whatever happened -- we were helpless down here. I could see our deaths inside my head. Pitiful, hopless, and wasted.{&1310}\par "Here we go," someone said from inside that crowd of trainees squashed up against the port view. It had a reverential tone to it, like what someone might say before doing something profoundly unique for the first time. We could have been about to make a high-orbital jump, or have a first kiss. The quiet that settled over them all made the whole thing feel almost spiritual in nature.{&1310}\par I suddenly couldn't breathe.{&1310}\par Miller was muttering under his breath. "\i Screw \i0 this."{&1310}\par He twisted back around, anxious frustration twisting his face. He went at the door and pounded a fist against it. Gagging on the feel of no air in my throat, I just watched him do it.{&1310}\par "It's locked, buddy," one of the crowd peeled his eyes away from the spectacle outside just long enough to chide Mills. Another guy followed him.{&1310}\par "Fuck, man," that one elbowed the other in the arm, "he's a Psycho. You know what they can do?"{&1310}\par "Psycho-in-training," the first shook his head, but abandoned the port to keep watching Mills. His friend did too.{&1310}\par Miller had a hand reached out to the console and had closed his eyes. I think he was trying to unlock it. From the outside or inside -- I don't know. I never saw any of the other cadets manage anything more than moving simple objects around during training. The hard stuff would've come later. But that never stopped some of them from experimenting on their own late at night in the safety of their bunkrooms. Maybe ...{&1310}\par Cannon fire sounded above us, shaking the whole ship. People gasped, and I thought we'd been hit. Maybe it didn't even matter if we got out of that room -- if we were still going to be blown apart out in the middle of dead space. The ship shifted more and it happened again. But ... not a hit -- us \i firing\i0 . There was a cry of excitement and someone pounded the port window.{&1310}\par "They're not even fighting back! They're running!"{&1310}\par Those two guys watching Mills with me whipped back around, looking pissed.{&1310}\par "Damn it, we missed it!"{&1310}\par Some other guy flicked the pirate ship off through the port. "Suck on that, fucking assholes!"{&1310}\par "Look, they're fucking turning back ... god, they're running away!"{&1310}\par "Yeeeeah! Betcha didn't think it'd be a warship coming out at ya!"{&1310}\par "Fuuuck, yes."{&1310}\par And just like that ... it was over. No incoming fire. No boarding party. No real fighting.{&1310}\par Nothing.{&1310}\par Later on, the lieutenant would inform us that they had hit a snare while in HV travel -- just like I thought. The systems reactivated all hands before it even dropped back to normal speeds and the captain opened fire before the enemy ship made any attempt to communicate or attack. If they had been pirates -- and they probably had been -- they weren't counting on an armed military vessel and almost immediately retreated. She was pretty quick with assuring us that the other ship was no match for the \i Noybaerleen \i0 in a stand-up fight.{&1310}\par What she didn't think about -- or any of the other trainees for that matter -- was how easily this could have been an unarmed transport we were on -- even a year ago. The pirates hadn't been so bold with the main routes back then. No one would have thought they needed to divert an entire gunship just to ferry around some new recruits. And we all would have been dead.{&1310}\par It was why we were so lucky, but I didn't feel so good about it like all the other trainees. Neither did Mills, I could tell. We were the only two not smiling and bragging and chattering excitedly away about it the whole rest of the way to Riftwatch station.{&1310}\par He never had managed to get that door open and there was all the reason in the world to believe we would have died down there otherwise. Locked in and helpless. It wasn't the kind of thing anyone else wanted to think about when they thought about this undeclared war with the pirates.{&1310}\par Dying alone and helpless in the middle of nowhere.\cf2\f1 {&1310}\par }{&1310}

It still looked like it must have in the Imperial days hundreds of years ago when it was a waypoint for pretty much all of the Helium-3 mining in the system. You could see the old, abbreviated name emblazoned on the sides of the docking pylons: HE3T - Helium-3 Transfer station. Heet. \i Heat\i0 . They'd kept that dumb pun but spaced the Empire when the Grand Admirals originally converted it into a command and supply port for the Dreggoran Navy. And that was way back after they'd just finished winning the first victories for independence against the old Empire.{&1310}\par They had liked to drone on and on about that kind of thing throughout training. Heritage. Tradition. I guess we were supposed to take some sort of pride in becoming something bigger than just ourselves. Too bad it had to make you feel so small and insignificant to do that. But I think that was part of the point.{&1310}\par We had our leave assignments. Cadets, recruits, and all the future of the Dreggoran Navy, swarmed into the old fighter bays of the \i Soyorov\i0  that now only trafficked in people and cargo, ready to fly out back home. People who'd barely seen each other in six months came flooding out of the woodwork, shouting and excited about how they had weathered the storm of training and were just about to be done and commissioned. Two weeks of home, fun, and distance were all that was left between them and the final run, and every last one of them was determined to make the best of it. It was like watching a bunch of kids who'd suddenly been told by the adults to just go run and play. This was their bachelor's party before getting married to the Grand Admirals for the rest of their adult lives. I guess I was the only one getting cold feet.{&1310}\par "Cadet Evelyn Weir. Report to Shuttle 9419B in Bay 23."{&1310}\par "I'm already here," I muttered under by breath as I stepped up to the big hangar doors leading into Bay 23. Not that grumbling back at an automated message had any point. It triggered in my personal comm because I was a second or two behind schedule in that annoyingly placid, female voice. The original architects must have meant it to sound neutral and attractive for the Grand Admirals' approval, but I swear I could always hear that faint hint of sarcasm when she had anything to say to me in particular. Oh, it was there -- I don't care what anybody might say. Tess would've thought so too. And I also liked to imagine that she'd been ugly, unlike her voice. I was probably the only one.{&1310}\par "Cadet," the shuttle pilot acknowledged as soon as I appeared in the bay. "Solansky, is it?" He barely looked up from the holopad on his arm as I stepped up to the onramp. "Come on, come on -- I'd like to get the hell off this warhorse before she decides to finally fall apart."{&1310}\par "Uh, Weir ... actually."{&1310}\par "What's that, cadet?" He did look up at me now. He was only an ensign with a boot-cut crew cut, but I could tell he took himself pretty seriously. Why did they always do that? Would I have?{&1310}\par Whatever.{&1310}\par "Cadet Weir, reporting as ordered, sir." I stiffened up and reported formally. Didn't mean I put any real heart in it, though. It was an empty gesture to steal away any ammunition a commissioned officer might use against me before I was gone again. I kind of already felt like I was, even if it wasn't physically. Yet.{&1310}\par "Weir, huh," he said, and swiped a finger across his manifest like crossing my name off a list. Then he jabbed a thumb over his shoulder. "Take a seat and get strapped in, cadet. Only got a few of you shipping out to Riftwatch, but it'll take a frigate to get you all that far. We've got forty-nine minutes to rendezvous outside the station."{&1310}\par I only sort of recognized the dozen or so other trainees I found already belted in to short-range G-seats line up in two parallel rows inside the shuttle's tiny holding bay. We'd shipped out at different times, even though all cadets had come together at Heat Station for induction. Other children of personnel from back on Riftwatch that I never really got to know too well since dad had kept most of my schooling private. Miller was here, and I found an empty seat next to him as much for it being the closest one as the quasi-familiarity we shared from both being in the same training program. I guess it made sense for us psychos to sit together. {&1310}\par "You ... excited to go back home?" he asked after trying a little wave with his hand. It didn't work out too well with those restrictions from the seat over his chest and shoulders, and he frowned at that. Or maybe it was the asanine question. You'd think it'd be easy to keep your head clear after all that training in discipline and decorum but it was surprisingly easy to forget how to do simple things once the instructors and officers were suddenly gone, when there was no one yelling at you when you did it wrong -- or telling you how to \i not \i0 fuck it up next time. Now we were just so quickly nothing but helpless kids again, with way too much military lifestyle information crammed into our heads for it to just be natural. It made us awkward, ungainly, and out of place.{&1310}\par "I don't know," I told him as I strapped in, really being honest. I wanted to say yes, and at the same time no. I didn't feel excited -- more unsettled than anything else. Like I'd been given a big fat boot in the ass and wasn't quite sure where I was supposed to land yet.  "I'm  ready to be out and away from here, though. Does that count?"{&1310}\par He laughed in an uncertain way. Like he hadn't expected to and that answer had caught him off guard. It probably had. I'd never really known him before we shipped out -- coming here for the same program as him was probably the only reason we ever would have met in the first place. Weird how we could live on the same station, never cross paths, and then only find out the other existed because of this stupid academy. But he seemed genuine enough, even if this was probably the first time I'd ever really had him talk to me, specifically. I'd always just kind of lumped him together with his rackmate, Hammar, whenever I thought anything about him in passing.{&1310}\par But there was something comforting in not being alone now that I was finally going back home.{&1310}\par {&1310}\par {&1310}\par {&1310}\par I fell asleep waiting for our shuttle to break free from the \i Soyorov\i0  so I didn't get to see it again from the outside in all its retired old glory like I had coming in half a year ago. A lifetime ago. I wondered if it would've still been so intimidating, but I didn't think so. I'd seen much more enlighteningly terrible things to be afraid of. There would be plenty more too -- for the cadets who came back.{&1310}\par The pilot roused each of us -- I wasn't the only one to pass out so easily when I finally stopped moving and had nothing to do but think and wait. Miller tried to give me another smile from one side as he went about unhooking himself from his seat. The half-awake-and-irritable-at-being-woken-up attempt I made back probably came off more like a grimance. {&1310}\par They'd extended a gangplank between the airlock in the back of the shuttle and the frigate -- the ship was nowhere near as big as the \i Soyorov \i0 and didn't have hangar bays for passenger shuttles like the carrier did. The pilot said it was supposed to ferry us back to Riftwatch. I saw it through the steelglass, hanging there in space like a finless fish with gunmounts on it. Looking back, Heat Station floated behind us. I hadn't even gotten to set foot inside this time. We were probably the only trainees that needed a gunboat to carry us back home.{&1310}\par They said things had gotten that bad, but it was hard to believe the system news reports with how subsidized by the Grand Admirals they were. And it was easy to forget inside that isolated bubble formed around us by the academy and training.{&1310}\par The lieutenant commander in charge of the frigate welcomed us formally to the ship, the \i Noybaerleen\i0 , though I'd have hardly called it much of a welcome. He kind of just gave us a curt, perfunctory permission to embark as the senior officer on board, but you could tell he didn't like us -- didn't want us there, and probably thought this "babysitting" thing was a waste of his time. Maybe it was. Either way, he dismissed both us and the shuttle pilot as quickly as humanly possible to return to his bridge, or whatever he felt was more important  just then. A junior grade lieutenant with a nervous twitch in her right eye showed us to the lower deck and then surprised us all by ordering us to change into G-Suits.{&1310}\par "Why?" I demanded, even though I knew it wouldn't change anything now that someone had made up their mind. It meant we were going to be traveling fast -- maybe even for a good reason.{&1310}\par The officer settled back into a composed rest stance, looking at me but addressing everyone when she explained. She didn't have to bother with a cadet like me, and could have even told me to shut up. I probably should have been grateful, but all I could think about was getting inside that glass, nightmare-prone prison once more.{&1310}\par "Pirate activity has been high in the region," she told us, being generous. "Skipper's ordered all crew to the tubes for the trip. And until we get to port -- that means all of you, too."{&1310}\par "Has there been another attack?" one of the other trainees -- a future grunt from the look of him -- asked, sounding excited. I'd set a bad precedent and now I wasn't the only one to speak up out of turn. Thankfully, the lieutenant seemed just a little bit patient with a bunch of kids. In spite of that nervous tick, she regarded him cooly.{&1310}\par "Don't you watch the news, recruit? Sightings," she told him. "If you want to know more than that, you're going to have to get commissioned or speculate on your own time. Now, get a move on, people!"{&1310}\par They'd come prepared with extra suits for us cadets and recruits and the lot of us quickly stripped down to our skivvies to get changed. I took the one the lieutenant handed me and started pulling it on, the whole while feeling like I'd rather just shoot myself in the head and get it over with now. The headaches and nightmares from the last trip to the field had finally just subsided earlier this week. I wasn't ready for another round yet, I just \i wasn't\i0 . Not so soon.{&1310}\par But what was I supposed to do? I could feel angry, hysterical tears burning behind my eyes and it was a struggle to keep them under control. \i Fuck\i0 . What was I supposed to do?{&1310}\par The only thing I really could. Just ... get in like every other time.{&1310}\par \i God\i0  ...{&1310}\par My body kept moving on its own, getting me dressed up in the G-suit like a robot. Thank god for training. When I was done, I lined up with the others in front of the tanks that were set aside for us. It was just the lieutenant chaperoning us here in the aft section, no on else from the crew. The officer stood there with her hands on her hips watching over us trainees getting ourselves in and strapped one by one. I waited for my turn as people checked each other off and then she did too, making sure they were all hooked up right. That unsettled feeling I'd had ever since leaving Commander Delacroix's office had turned me into a taut string ready to snap down here at the claustrophobic thought of getting back inside one of those horror shows. I waited, but I could feel the tension like I would suddenly just break down and lose it any second. And I still had the self-awareness to realize just how much it would ruin me to burst into tears right there in front of everyone. The instructors had always played it down, but it got harder every time. No one else would understand if I was so close to breaking -- I'd just be a freakout.{&1310}\par The lieutenant rounded on me, catching me by surprise. It was my turn, and I ... had a surreal moment then, suddenly staring back at the tank meant for me. I looked at it, and couldn't help but feel like a whole in my world had suddenly opened up there where no one else could see it. I was suddenly so sure that if I got inside that tank I would just fall through and cease to exist here altogether.{&1310}\par How could I tell her that? How could I make her \i believe\i0  ...?{&1310}\par I didn't know, but I turned back to try. It didn't matter. The whole ship had gone quiet -- \i too\i0  quiet for a military ship in port getting under way. I thought it was just me. Then the overhead lights winked out.{&1310}\par Cold washed over me like ice water, prickling my skin. I froze in place. There should have been cries of surprise -- maybe even alarm -- the tanks hadn't all sealed yet, and there was the officer. But there was nothing. Just the sound of my breathing in the still air.{&1310}\par Panic.{&1310}\par A dozen thoughts raced through my head. Power failure. Sabotage. Terrorist attack on the station. The ship? I could almost imagine the sound of turbines winding down to rest or the dull thud of explosions through the bulkheads. And I could only imagine -- because there was nothing. I suddenly couldn't even sense any of those trainees who had still been waiting around me just a second ago and there was this terrified fear of absolutely everyone just being \i gone\i0 .{&1310}\par I reached a hand out, reflexively. The need to not be suddenly alone in the dark was overwhelming. Primordial. Nothing. My mind raced along, but my body was sluggish. I staggered a step back and my foot caught on someting. And the fall down to the ground seemed to last a quiet eternity there in the dark.{&1310}\par The deck was sticky. It stuck to my hand and my back.{&1310}\par Emergency lighting flashed on in dull reds, painting the black the color of blood.{&1310}\par I wasn't stupid enough to cry out. Something told me on a level I couldn't even comprehend that it would be the worst thing I could do. I could just barely see in the weak, reddish deck lights, but seeing at all made me need to move again. That same sense told me not to -- to stay put and shut up. For what? I don't know. I scrambled up instead on stupid instinct and saw the thing that had tripped me. I squinted at it for a long time before it started to look human. Human, but like the upper half had just been ripped away ... leaving only a pair of legs from the waist down ending in booted feet. That was what had tripped me.{&1310}\par I wiped a hand to my face and froze when I saw what looked like blood there. It was the light. I had to be. But it stuck between my fingers, running slowly and thickly as I watched.{&1310}\par And that was when I noticed I was surrounded by those vaguely human-looking bits and pieces. They were all around me. Everywhere. There must have been a dozen when you added them all up. More, maybe. All of them just ... torn apart.{&1310}\par Something moved. The blackness suddenly shifted, coming alive. It blotted out the emergency lights and I sucked in a startled breath, wide-eyed and terrified. It whipped back and forth like a snake while I watched, transfixed. I didn't move now, but it knew I was there. Because I had moved when I shouldn't have. It knew I was there because it launched itself right at my head.{&1310}\par I crashed back down into the deck full of sticky red blood as it smothered me. I opened my mouth to scream and it squirmed right down my throat.{&1310}\par {&1310}\par {&1310}\par {&1310}\par "Hey!"{&1310}\par My body lurched up and out of the dark and suddenly people were there with the lights back on. Hands were on me -- I threw them off. That thing was down my throat and I was choking on it. I grabbed onto that someone who was trying to hold me down and shoved them away. Only after he tumbled over backwards into the deck did I realize it was just Miller. He looked up at me with a dazed expression on his face.{&1310}\par That thing in my throat was the breathing tube. I was gagging on it, the disgusting feel of that blackness so abruptly violating me all I could think about and making me choke. I reached up and ripped it out, throwing up water on myself while I did.{&1310}\par I was slumped over in my tank, drained and leaving me soaked in proto-amniotic fluid. The other trainees had been reactivating around me, climbing out of their tubes. A few glanced my way after I threw out Mills. He picked himself up from the floor, giving me a wary look.{&1310}\par "You okay, Weir?"{&1310}\par I tried to get my breathing under control, but I was still coughing up stuff from my stomach and lungs. It was just a dream. Just a dream. I forced that thought back down my throat as hard and fast as I could too. Just another \i stupid\i0  dream - like the others. I remembered now, things coming back in a jumbled rush. I'd managed to get in and go to sleep. Then I'd started dreaming back to getting on the ship with that morbid little bit of carnage thrown in just for fun. {&1310}\par These \i fucking\i0  tubes! {&1310}\par But it hadn't felt quite the same. I wasn't there as somebody else like living through a memory or riding around on the inside of their head. This time it was me and \i just\i0  me and that place was on a ship like this one and I didn't think I--{&1310}\par "Hey! Can you even hear me? Snap out of it, Weir!" {&1310}\par Miller was back in my face. I didn't think he meant to choke me this time, but I didn't get the chance to find out because that lieutenant who'd been chaperoning us from before came running into the room behind with a live rifle clutched in her hands. I remembered standing here and getting into the tube and, at the same time, falling in the dark before I ever could. I felt like I'd fallen out of time just looking at everyone suddenly displaced along with me. Except, they acted like nothing else had happened.{&1310}\par Why did it always feel so fucking real?{&1310}\par "Move it! Move it!" the lieutenant cried at us, still in her own G-suit and dripping translucent tank sludge all over the deck. It was pretty obvious she had just hopped out and grabbed a weapon. Her blond hair was dark and clinging to her lined face. "Get out of those tanks and line up, trainees!"{&1310}\par "What the hell ..." Mills muttered as his head whipped back around. For the first time, I realized that there were yellow warning lights flashing along the seams of the bulkheads and dull-pitched klaxons droning through the air. The ship was under attack.{&1310}\par "Pirates?" someone else blurted out before they could even get in formation, frozen and looking around in awe after coming to the same conclusion as me. The lieutenant just shook her head.{&1310}\par "That's not what you need to worry about right now, recruit. Fall in!"{&1310}\par He did. But not without barking out some more.{&1310}\par "What if there's a boarding party? We need to get to the armory! Uh, ma'am!"{&1310}\par He had that nervous excitement in his popping eyes beneath a shaved head, eyeballing the officer's rifle eagerly. Some of the others were coming alive too. Tank-sleep subdued by pre-battle anticipation. Because that was what they thought was happening. Months and months of training for just this sort of thing and now it was sort of just happening all of a sudden on this inconsequential little gunboat transport for a dozen boots.{&1310}\par "Shut your mouths," the woman snapped at them -- at us all -- with a warning finger, "and follow me."{&1310}\par Murmuring now. All that pro-military, fight-the-good-fight bullshit shoved down their throats this whole time abruptly vomited back up all at once. Not me -- I just felt like retching up something else entirely, though. I felt sick, that tank-dream still stuck in my head.{&1310}\par How did I know those bodies weren't theirs and I wasn't some freak prophet? It had happened before. Old Haakon was supposed to have only had the ability to See -- no other psychokinetic abilities. It was how they said he had beaten the Imperials, with their limitless fleets and death drones raining down from the skies on the scattered colonies. Maybe, but it was almost funny how much wishful thinking that was. Wouldn't it be easier to just accept that I had no talent at all? I guess so. But, if it was even possible -- well, too bad my dreams were only ever about death. That couldn't have been a good thing.{&1310}\par "Don't worry," Miller said as we jogged along after the lieutenant down the ship corridor. I realized he was talking to me. The rest of the crew were coming alive and bustling about, nearly running us over. He was looking back over his shoulder at me. Nervous, but he tried to hide it.{&1310}\par God, now \i really\i0  wasn't the time.{&1310}\par We didn't end up at the armory. Instead, the lieutenant took us to the tiny mess and stuck us trainees in there while she disappeared to report to the bridge. Some of the others -- like that one guy who'd seemed so eager -- were disappointed. Pissed even. If the door hadn't been locked from the outside behind the officer, I'm pretty sure they would have done something stupid. Instead, we were just stuck.{&1310}\par Stuck in that tiny little tomb on a ship under attack. And for some reason I was the only one who seemed worried sick instead of just feeling cheated.{&1310}\par The good news was that the mess had a port looking out into space. The bad news was that there was only one and everyone was suddenly shoving their way over there to see.{&1310}\par "Where are they?"{&1310}\par "I can't see anything."{&1310}\par "Goddamnit, let me in!"{&1310}\par A couple future grunts started fighting over the prime spots, but that got broken up quick when someone stabbed an overextended finger over their heads into the glass.{&1310}\par "Look!"{&1310}\par "Is that it?"{&1310}\par "I can't fucking tell!"{&1310}\par I couldn't see either and I wasn't sure I wanted too. I stood back from that mass of excited trainees just watching them, still feeling slightly nauseous. Miller looked like he wanted to join them too, but stayed back like me. Probably thought Psychos were better than all that useless jockeying. Hah. Maybe they were, who knew. But they should have been scared. There were some pretty damn good reasons to be.{&1310}\par I had read about this sort of thing -- we all had, during training. The pirates liked to leave improvised anti-high velocity travel devices like snares along known traffick routes between populated parts of the sector. Out here in the dark they'd catch ships helpless and get them. Not for the money, valuables, or cargo, though. Never that. Shenlizite -- that was all they ever took. The stuff they put in everything to make it work. Most ships and the crew onboard died pretty quickly once they ripped it out of the engines' fuel cells.{&1310}\par "No ensignia," someone noted.{&1310}\par "What?"{&1310}\par "They've got no ensignia -- it's gotta be pirates. Only they fly without colors out here."{&1310}\par "Who cares? It's all Tau bullshit anyways."{&1310}\par "Yeah, everyone knows they're funding the pieces of shit -- might as well be flying their banner for all it matters."{&1310}\par "I heard \i that\i0 ."{&1310}\par I didn't need to see the other ship to have a good idea what was coming our way. Maybe they hailed the captain and asked for him to surrender. Maybe they didn't. They probably didn't. All I had to wait for was the telltale rock of railgun fire. We all knew what it felt like in the simulations and somehow the real thing was still always ten times worse.{&1310}\par It was the fear.{&1310}\par The lights dimmed and the bulkheads came alive with the pervasive hum of power being redirected to ablative armor plating and weapons. We'd come in a gunship, so at least we could fight back. But that sickening wrench in my stomach from when I'd woken back up in the tank began to twist into a creeping sense of terror instead. Whatever happened -- we were helpless down here. I could see our deaths inside my head. Pitiful, hopless, and wasted.{&1310}\par "Here we go," someone said from inside that crowd of trainees squashed up against the port view. It had a reverential tone to it, like what someone might say before doing something profoundly unique for the first time. We could have been about to make a high-orbital jump, or have a first kiss. The quiet that settled over them all made the whole thing feel almost spiritual in nature.{&1310}\par I suddenly couldn't breathe.{&1310}\par Miller was muttering something under his breath. "\i Screw \i0 this."{&1310}\par He twisted back around, anxious frustration twisting his face. He went at the door and pounded a fist against it. {&1310}\par "What are you doing?" I managed to squeak at him, gagging on the feel of no air in my throat.{&1310}\par "It's locked, buddy," one of the crowd peeled his eyes away from the spectacle outside just long enough to chide Mills. Another guy followed him. And that one watched him ease up and flex his hand so that his palm was flat against the metal. His face smoothed out with it and he took a deep, calming breath.{&1310}\par "Fuck, man," that one elbowed the other in the arm, "he's a Psycho. You know what they can do?"{&1310}\par "Psycho-in-training," the first shook his head, but abandoned the port to keep watching Mills. His friend did too.{&1310}\par Miller had a hand reached out to the console now too and closed his eyes. I think he was trying to unlock it. From the outside or inside -- I don't know. I never saw any of the other cadets manage anything more than moving simple objects around during training. The hard stuff would've come later. But that never stopped some of them from experimenting on their own late at night in the safety of their bunkrooms. Maybe ...{&1310}\par "You can do it, Mills," I told him, as encouragingly as I could. I could hope.{&1310}\par "Shut up," he snapped, then completely reversed himself. "I mean -- sorry. I just ... I need to concentrate."{&1310}\par Cannon fire sounded above us, shaking the whole ship. People gasped, and I thought we'd been hit. Maybe it didn't even matter if we got out of that room -- if we were still going to be blown apart out in the middle of dead space. The ship shifted more and it happened again. But ... not a hit -- us \i firing\i0 . There was a cry of excitement and someone pounded the port window.{&1310}\par "They're not even fighting back! They're running!"{&1310}\par Those two guys watching Mills with me whipped back around, looking pissed.{&1310}\par "Damn it, we missed it!"{&1310}\par Some other guy flicked the pirate ship off through the port. "Suck on that, fucking assholes!"{&1310}\par "Look, they're fucking turning back ... god, they're running away!"{&1310}\par "Yeeeeah! Betcha didn't think it'd be a warship coming out at ya!"{&1310}\par "Fuuuck, yes."{&1310}\par And just like that ... it was over. No incoming fire. No boarding party. No real fighting.{&1310}\par Nothing.{&1310}\par Later on, the lieutenant would inform us that they had hit a snare while in HV travel -- just like I thought. The systems reactivated all hands before it even dropped back to normal speeds and the captain opened fire before the enemy ship made any attempt to communicate or attack. If they had been pirates -- and they probably had been -- they weren't counting on an armed military vessel and almost immediately retreated. She was pretty quick with assuring us that the other ship was no match for the \i Noybaerleen \i0 in a stand-up fight.{&1310}\par What she didn't think about -- or any of the other trainees for that matter -- was how easily this could have been an unarmed transport we were on -- even a year ago. The pirates hadn't been so bold with the main routes back then. No one would have thought they needed to divert an entire gunship just to ferry around some new recruits. And we all would have been dead.{&1310}\par It was why we were so lucky, but I didn't feel so good about it like all the other trainees. Neither did Mills, I could tell. We were the only two not smiling and bragging and chattering excitedly away about it the whole rest of the way to Riftwatch station.{&1310}\par He never had managed to get that door open and there was all the reason in the world to believe we would have died down there otherwise. Locked in and helpless. It wasn't the kind of thing anyone else wanted to think about when they thought about this guerilla war with the pirates.{&1310}\par Dying alone and helpless in the middle of nowhere.\cf2\f1 {&1310}\par }{&1310}
