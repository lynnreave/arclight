But too little, too late.{&1310}\par He sighed. Again.{&1310}\par "You are still neglecting your reading, Evelyn," he said from behind. And as if to make his point more right than he always was, a yawn came on that I couldn't choke down before it got out.{&1310}\par He reached down while I was still trying to hide it behind a hand and the monitors winked back out.{&1310}\par He moved away. {&1310}\par "I had hoped you might finish much more today," he continued on, a little irritably, hands clasped behind his back. {&1310}\par I didn't have to look. I knew the tone.{&1310}\par "But I'm afraid that will be impossible now."{&1310}\par He stopped.{&1310}\par I blinked. Then threw the nearest clock a dubious look. The dizziness had started to fade. Not the skull fracture, though.{&1310}\par "It's still early," I told him as if he didn't already know. And was dumb enough to give him an incredulous glance. "What do you mean?"{&1310}\par Those crystalline blue eyes caught the light and glinted like ice when I twisted back around to look at him. Hard and cold beneath his white brow, the skin around drawn tight and wrinkled. He had been an old man for more than twenty years. And never got tired of reminding me of that. Still, twenty-some years. And still, I couldn't meet that gaze for long.\b {&1310}\par \b0 It was how he kept questions at bay. He hated explaining himself. Especially to me. Better I just took what little I was given and did as he said.{&1310}\par Today was different, though. He actually kept on after that for once.{&1310}\par "I was given a," he offered, pausing for the right word. He forgot me for a moment.{&1310}\par But, eventually, it came to him.{&1310}\par "A warning," he finished. Then abruptly rushed forward.{&1310}\par "It's time to leave."{&1310}\par He had almost made it to the door before I got my mouth back shut. I just stared for a few, long moments. Stared at him. And stared for those words coming out of his mouth. {&1310}\par My response, when it finally came, was even more eloquent.{&1310}\par "What?"{&1310}\par He stopped in the doorway. After a moment, he even glanced back. And he did something I had not seen him do in a very long, long ... \i long \i0 time.{&1310}\par He smiled at me.{&1310}\par "Get whatever you need, but only what you can carry," he said. For a moment, those eyes were not quite so hard.{&1310}\par "We're going planetside."{&1310}\par Then he was gone again before I could even think to ask why.{&1310}\par But I thought about it. A lot. While I tore apart everything in my closet of a room and desperately tried to stuff it into whatever I could find and carry.{&1310}\par Long story short, I managed to get all of it into three mismatched travel cases and a backpack. The important stuff, anyways. And with one hand free, two bags slung behind on the pack, and too much weight on my left foot, I just barely managed to hobble on out to go find my father again an hour or so later.\b {&1310}\par \b0 {&1310}\par {&1310}\par I nearly did a double-take while half-striding, half-limping for the life of me along the upper causeway above the central grounds. I was looking around, and down. A lot of the old monks and scholars liked to think out loud or whatever while walking around the painstakingly manicured gardens. But I recognized an all too familiar head of abnormally pink hair peeking out amongst dark robes and green shrubbery.{&1310}\par "Hey! Tess! Up here!"{&1310}\par The other woman turned around and craned her neck back, shielding her eyes. I waved exaggeratedly down. She could have barely heard me from over the dull roar of all the fountains.{&1310}\par And I couldn't hear her as she tried to shout back up at me. I just called down again.{&1310}\par "Hold on! I'll be right there!"{&1310}\par I slung my bags back into place and stumbled my way down and around the walkways to her.{&1310}\par She gave me a funny look as I hurried up.{&1310}\par "Hey," I said again, only a little out of breath. Somehow, I still managed a yawn, though, as I swung the bags around and letthem flop onto the mock-pavement. "What are you up to?"{&1310}\par Those bright green eyes bounced with the travel cases, smirking. She kept giving me that all too familiar, sporting look.{&1310}\par "Shouldn't you be \i studying \i0 somewhere?"{&1310}\par She even threw her head a little into it. {&1310}\par And I just stood up straight. Towering half a head over her.{&1310}\par "Shouldn't \i you\i0  be cleaning up something?"{&1310}\par She half-snickered and turned, that smile still painted on her face. She shrugged.{&1310}\par "If he can catch me, I will."{&1310}\par A few of the old men traipsing about the grounds were giving us the stink-eye. From running around during the day or shirking whatever they thought we should be doing, who knew. Both of us had long since learned to ignore them. You think they would have done the same.{&1310}\par "So," the other woman gestured with both her arms folded across her chest. "You gonna tell me what all those are for?"{&1310}\par I glanced back down at my bags.{&1310}\par "Oh. Yeah."{&1310}\par I only managed to hold on the suspense for a fraction of a second. Then I told her everything that my father had said - verbatim. I got to watch her eyes get bigger and bigger with each word. And, by the end, she was standing there with her mouth hanging open even worse than mine had been.{&1310}\par "But that ... that ..." she stammered, chin bobbing in disbelief. It finally managed to catch.{&1310}\par "That's not fair!"{&1310}\par I almost laughed at the look on her face. Well, I did. And quickly caught it as best I could.{&1310}\par "Sorry."{&1310}\par It was hard to choke it down, though.{&1310}\par Tess stomped away a few steps. Fuming.{&1310}\par When she came back, she was still red-faced and livid. She growled at empty space.{&1310}\par "What about me?" she groaned. "That message didn't even say anything about \i you\i0 ."{&1310}\par "What?"{&1310}\par She shook her head quickly, though.{&1310}\par "Nothing."{&1310}\par And growled again.{&1310}\par "That's not \i fair\i0 !"{&1310}\par She ranted for a bit. I pretended to listen. There were a few chanters in the courtyards, though, singing about old Haakon and the prophecies he made while meditating centuries ago on the station under the light of the Rift. I had to read them too, as boring and misinterpreted as they were. Most of the monks actually thought that lightshow out in space gave old Haakon his visions. All I knew was that it made the flowers in the gardens bloom a pretty, serpentine sort of violet that everyone thought was just amazing. They made sure that gaping skylight out to space stayed open.{&1310}\par Eventually, Tess started to burn herself out. Or, at least, she got tired of raving for a disinterested audience. Not that it wouldn't have been nice to take the other woman with her. They were best friends and all. But it was still something to make her jealous for once.{&1310}\par Neither one of us had ever left the station. Ever. Riftwatch had been our home for almost twenty-three years. Less a year or two for Tess. And while I had the pleasure of endless lectures and mindless studying in the archives, she got to live with fat, old Bertram running one of the local dormitories for travelers to the Rift. She ended up doing most of the cleaning more often than not. And I wasn't sure who to pity more.{&1310}\par She knew that. I could see the frantic look in her eyes. She had gotten past furious now and was ready to start pleading. Those green eyes welled up big and earnest beneath her freakishly pink hair.{&1310}\par "You \i have\i0  to bring me something back," she all but begged. And then took on a harder edge. "I will absolutely \i hate\i0  you if you don't."{&1310}\par "Well, of course."{&1310}\par But apparently it wasn't so obvious to her that I would, because she had to tell me five more times and make me swear about a dozen before she would let it go. And by then I think even \i I\i0  was almost bored with the thought of leaving already.{&1310}\par "So," she transitioned seemlessly with a flip of her dyed hair, "you going to go look for stuffy old Weir now?" And fixed me with an unforgiving, defeated eye.{&1310}\par I barked a laugh back at her. "You going to go back to helping Bertram now?"{&1310}\par Again, she shrugged, looking away. She shook her head.{&1310}\par "I've got all day to do his chores. By the way, you- oh \i no\i0  ..."{&1310}\par Her eyes had gone wide again. This time, in horror. And I spun around to see where she was looking.{&1310}\par "What?"\b {&1310}\par \b0 I got my answer just as quickly. Part of it, anyways. A familiar man in heavy uniform and coat was making his way right toward us. Fast.{&1310}\par I twisted right back around at Tess.{&1310}\par "What did you do?"{&1310}\par I started to cry out at her. But I only got part way. Before I even opened my mouth, she was moving.{&1310}\par "Nothing!" she shouted back over her shoulder at me. And then, a split second later, "Run for it!"{&1310}\par "\i Hey\i0 !"{&1310}\par I snatched up my bags without thinking, but the second twisted over before I could get it all the way around and hit the ground again. Tess was already clear across the walkway. She vanished around a bend in the gardens before I even managed to get all my things hooked back on me.{&1310}\par And by then, it was too late.{&1310}\par I stumbled a few steps. Nearly tripped over flat on my face twice. And had just enough time to watch the uniformed man make the last few steps easy on himself catching up with me.{&1310}\par A big hand clamped down hard on one shoulder, grinding into bone. It pulled me up fast.{&1310}\par "And just where do you think \i you\i0 '\i re\i0  going, girl?"{&1310}\par I think I heard my heart sink at the sound of his voice.

A few tries with the rest of my clumsy fingers and the three screens above me flared to life. I winced at that too. But it wasn't just for the light.{&1310}\par The book I was supposed to be reading was scrolled across the pane there. \i History of  \i0 ... I didn't even remember. Or care. I knew it was about three superbeings or something from another dimension that a lot of people liked to think really existed. Whatever. The old man did. Maybe that was why he made me read about it so much.{&1310}\par Medai, Azrael, and Myrtu. In case he asked. Evil ones, anyways. I wouldn't ever know why he found it so important to learn.{&1310}\par I had the system back on, anyways. And I even got the chair up and back under me. But too little, too late.{&1310}\par He sighed. Again.{&1310}\par "You are still neglecting your reading, Evelyn," he said from behind. And as if to make his point more right than he always was, a yawn came on that I couldn't choke down before it got out.{&1310}\par He reached down while I was still trying to hide it behind a hand and the monitors winked back out.{&1310}\par He moved away. {&1310}\par "I had hoped you might finish much more today," he continued on, a little irritably, hands clasped behind his back. {&1310}\par I didn't have to look. I knew the tone.{&1310}\par "But I'm afraid that will be impossible now."{&1310}\par He stopped.{&1310}\par I blinked. Then threw the nearest clock a dubious look. The dizziness had started to fade. Not the skull fracture, though.{&1310}\par "It's still early," I told him as if he didn't already know. And was dumb enough to give him an incredulous glance. "What do you mean?"{&1310}\par Those crystalline blue eyes caught the light and glinted like ice when I twisted back around to look at him. Hard and cold beneath his white brow, the skin around drawn tight and wrinkled. He had been an old man for more than twenty years. And never got tired of reminding me of that. Still, twenty-some years. And still, I couldn't meet that gaze for long.\b {&1310}\par \b0 It was how he kept questions at bay. He hated explaining himself. Especially to me. Better I just took what little I was given and did as he said.{&1310}\par Today was different, though. He actually kept on after that for once.{&1310}\par "I was given a," he offered, pausing for the right word. He forgot me for a moment.{&1310}\par But, eventually, it came to him.{&1310}\par "A warning," he finished. Then abruptly rushed forward.{&1310}\par "It's time to leave."{&1310}\par He had almost made it to the door before I got my mouth back shut. I just stared for a few, long moments. Stared at him. And stared for those words coming out of his mouth. {&1310}\par My response, when it finally came, was even more eloquent.{&1310}\par "What?"{&1310}\par He stopped in the doorway. After a moment, he even glanced back. And he did something I had not seen him do in a very long, long ... \i long \i0 time.{&1310}\par He smiled at me.{&1310}\par "Get whatever you need, but only what you can carry," he said. For a moment, those eyes were not quite so hard.{&1310}\par "We're going planetside."{&1310}\par Then he was gone again before I could even think to ask why.{&1310}\par But I thought about it. A lot. While I tore apart everything in my closet of a room and desperately tried to stuff it into whatever I could find and carry.{&1310}\par Long story short, I managed to get all of it into three mismatched travel cases and a backpack. The important stuff, anyways. And with one hand free, two bags slung behind on the pack, and too much weight on my left foot, I just barely managed to hobble on out to go find my father again an hour or so later.\b {&1310}\par \b0 {&1310}\par {&1310}\par I nearly did a double-take while half-striding, half-limping for the life of me along the upper causeway above the central grounds. I was looking around, and down. A lot of the old monks and scholars liked to think out loud or whatever while walking around the painstakingly manicured gardens. But I recognized an all too familiar head of abnormally pink hair peeking out amongst dark robes and green shrubbery.{&1310}\par "Hey! Tess! Up here!"{&1310}\par The other woman turned around and craned her neck back, shielding her eyes. I waved exaggeratedly down. She could have barely heard me from over the dull roar of all the fountains.{&1310}\par And I couldn't hear her as she tried to shout back up at me. I just called down again.{&1310}\par "Hold on! I'll be right there!"{&1310}\par I slung my bags back into place and stumbled my way down and around the walkways to her.{&1310}\par She gave me a funny look as I hurried up.{&1310}\par "Hey," I said again, only a little out of breath. Somehow, I still managed a yawn, though, as I swung the bags around and letthem flop onto the mock-pavement. "What are you up to?"{&1310}\par Those bright green eyes bounced with the travel cases, smirking. She kept giving me that all too familiar, sporting look.{&1310}\par "Shouldn't you be \i studying \i0 somewhere?"{&1310}\par She even threw her head a little into it. {&1310}\par And I just stood up straight. Towering half a head over her.{&1310}\par "Shouldn't \i you\i0  be cleaning up something?"{&1310}\par She half-snickered and turned, that smile still painted on her face. She shrugged.{&1310}\par "If he can catch me, I will."{&1310}\par A few of the old men traipsing about the grounds were giving us the stink-eye. From running around during the day or shirking whatever they thought we should be doing, who knew. Both of us had long since learned to ignore them. You think they would have done the same.{&1310}\par "So," the other woman gestured with both her arms folded across her chest. "You gonna tell me what all those are for?"{&1310}\par I glanced back down at my bags.{&1310}\par "Oh. Yeah."{&1310}\par I only managed to hold on the suspense for a fraction of a second. Then I told her everything that my father had said - verbatim. I got to watch her eyes get bigger and bigger with each word. And, by the end, she was standing there with her mouth hanging open even worse than mine had been.{&1310}\par "But that ... that ..." she stammered, chin bobbing in disbelief. It finally managed to catch.{&1310}\par "That's not fair!"{&1310}\par I almost laughed at the look on her face. Well, I did. And quickly caught it as best I could.{&1310}\par "Sorry."{&1310}\par It was hard to choke it down, though.{&1310}\par Tess stomped away a few steps. Fuming.{&1310}\par When she came back, she was still red-faced and livid. She growled at empty space.{&1310}\par "What about me?" she groaned. "That message didn't even say anything about \i you\i0 ."{&1310}\par "What?"{&1310}\par She shook her head quickly, though.{&1310}\par "Nothing."{&1310}\par And growled again.{&1310}\par "That's not \i fair\i0 !"{&1310}\par She ranted for a bit. I pretended to listen. There were a few chanters in the courtyards, though, singing about old Haakon and the prophecies he made while meditating centuries ago on the station under the light of the Rift. I had to read them too, as boring and misinterpreted as they were. Most of the monks actually thought that lightshow out in space gave old Haakon his visions. All I knew was that it made the flowers in the gardens bloom a pretty, serpentine sort of violet that everyone thought was just amazing. They made sure that gaping skylight out to space stayed open.{&1310}\par Eventually, Tess started to burn herself out. Or, at least, she got tired of raving for a disinterested audience. Not that it wouldn't have been nice to take the other woman with her. They were best friends and all. But it was still something to make her jealous for once.{&1310}\par Neither one of us had ever left the station. Ever. Riftwatch had been our home for almost twenty-three years. Less a year or two for Tess. And while I had the pleasure of endless lectures and mindless studying in the archives, she got to live with fat, old Bertram running one of the local dormitories for travelers to the Rift. She ended up doing most of the cleaning more often than not. And I wasn't sure who to pity more.{&1310}\par She knew that. I could see the frantic look in her eyes. She had gotten past furious now and was ready to start pleading. Those green eyes welled up big and earnest beneath her freakishly pink hair.{&1310}\par "You \i have\i0  to bring me something back," she all but begged. And then took on a harder edge. "I will absolutely \i hate\i0  you if you don't."{&1310}\par "Well, of course."{&1310}\par But apparently it wasn't so obvious to her that I would, because she had to tell me five more times and make me swear about a dozen before she would let it go. And by then I think even \i I\i0  was almost bored with the thought of leaving already.{&1310}\par "So," she transitioned seemlessly with a flip of her dyed hair, "you going to go look for stuffy old Weir now?" And fixed me with an unforgiving, defeated eye.{&1310}\par I barked a laugh back at her. "You going to go back to helping Bertram now?"{&1310}\par Again, she shrugged, looking away. She shook her head.{&1310}\par "I've got all day to do his chores. By the way, you- oh \i no\i0  ..."{&1310}\par Her eyes had gone wide again. This time, in horror. And I spun around to see where she was looking.{&1310}\par "What?"\b {&1310}\par \b0 I got my answer just as quickly. Part of it, anyways. A familiar man in heavy uniform and coat was making his way right toward us. Fast.{&1310}\par I twisted right back around at Tess.{&1310}\par "What did you do?"{&1310}\par I started to cry out at her. But I only got part way. Before I even opened my mouth, she was moving.{&1310}\par "Nothing!" she shouted back over her shoulder at me. And then, a split second later, "Run for it!"{&1310}\par "\i Hey\i0 !"{&1310}\par I snatched up my bags without thinking, but the second twisted over before I could get it all the way around and hit the ground again. Tess was already clear across the walkway. She vanished around a bend in the gardens before I even managed to get all my things hooked back on me.{&1310}\par And by then, it was too late.{&1310}\par I stumbled a few steps. Nearly tripped over flat on my face twice. And had just enough time to watch the uniformed man make the last few steps easy on himself catching up with me.{&1310}\par A big hand clamped down hard on one shoulder, grinding into bone. It pulled me up fast.{&1310}\par "And just where do you think \i you\i0 '\i re\i0  going, girl?"{&1310}\par I think I heard my heart sink at the sound of his voice. But it might have just been the travel cases slumping back down hard into the ground.\f2\fs22 {&1310}\par }{&1310}
