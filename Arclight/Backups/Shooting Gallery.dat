And that caught the other woman up dead in her tracks more than us nearly getting beaten, thrown around, cut apart, and gunned down in the past day or so.{&1310}\par "What?" she all but shrieked. "And you just \i killed\i0  them?"{&1310}\par "I could have let them kill you instead," he said simply, stepping over to one of the bodies. "Besides." He kicked that one over with a boot. "They're not all dead."{&1310}\par The man on the ground came back to life in a violent fit of coughing. Julian reached down with the barrel of his rifle and tapped a button on the back of the other's helmet.

He had nudged the barrel back around under the patroller's exposed chin. That one had blood sticking to half his jagged face and couldn't keep from wheezing.{&1310}\par Julian glanced at her. Then back down to the man on the ground.{&1310}\par "On your feet." At the pink-haired woman's desperate look, he explained, "He's our collateral for getting in."{&1310}\par The man climbed unsteadily back up from the dirt, casting a harried look around at his dead companions. He bent in on himself, retching over between his knees.{&1310}\par "No, no, no, no, no - " Tess finally said, backing up a few, halting steps. "I can't - I can't do this."{&1310}\par She rounded back on me, stumbling.{&1310}\par "Come on, Eve. We're getting the hell away from this maniac."{&1310}\par She grabbed my arm, trying to pull me away back the way we had come. There wasn't much strength in it, though.{&1310}\par "You go back that way," Julian called after - too calm. His voice was just too even, gun trained steady on his new hostage. "And you will never get off this moon."{&1310}\par I had a flash of that man back on this ship - stabbing Dad right through the back with that gleaming length of black steel. A sword like they only used those in old vids about centuries ago.{&1310}\par Tess was talking, but I squeezed my eyes shut to block it out.{&1310}\par "And stay here with a murderer? Pfft!

And then she was just trying to keep up with me trying to keep up with Julian trying to run that security guard into the ground. The Eluvian didn't seem too surprised to find us behind him again. Tess tried grumbling venemously the whole way. But she hardly had the strength for that either.{&1310}\par We followed him another half a klick or so. There, he got the patroller talking with the butt of his rifle until the man pointed him towards something that looked like a much less friendly version of that old man's truck with a large gun mounted on the top, hidden away between buildings and storage bins.
