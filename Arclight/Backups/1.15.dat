Everything upended in a sudden, violent outcry of grinding steel and flashing red lgihts. It flung her back up and over the chair into the deck. She crashed into a shoulder, and flopped over onto her stomach. And the rest of the shuttle came raining down on top.{&1310}\par Vertigo. She lay there on the floor for a moment as the whole shuttle spun, alarms blaring and trying to snatch her up towards the wall. It rained random garbage, and a low whirring started to crescendo. Sparks popped, crackled, and danced across panels. It was a wonder nothing caught on fire. And, all the while, a sharp, brain-numbing pain was screaming and swallowing her in white noise from that one shoulder.{&1310}\par Eventually, she realized her mouth was open. She squeezed it shut, clenching her teeth instead. Found her good hand, and pushed up from the deck with it. The shuttle knocked her back over. And then she half-crawled, half-slid along the metal floor toward the pilot's chair with her bad arm cradled close into her stomach.{&1310}\par A hand crept up the console and managed to kill the engines with a few clumsy slaps. It took another minute for the thing to stop spinning. Longer still for the dizziness to pass. She waited.{&1310}\par The shuttle was drifting fast when she climbed back into the chair, hunching over her numb arm. A couple sporadic bursts from the engines slowed it down. They were malfunctioning, though. The readout told her that much at least. That thing had clocked her pretty good.{&1310}\par If she had thought to spend any more time worrying about that, though, she was wrong. When she glanced up towards the forward view again, she stopped dead in her tracks.{&1310}\par A ship loomed out there. A huge cruiser that blotted out the stars all around.{&1310}\par She was close. A few thousand klicks at most. And that hull was almost flat against her forward port. If she hadn;t stopped when she did ...{&1310}\par It was barely moving. The hull was dark from what she could see, and the whole thing looked dead in space. She tried to peek around but it was almost impossible to tell if it was the same ship. She was sure, though. There wasn't much chance it could be anything else out there just then.{&1310}\par Ev and old Weir were on that ship. At least, they had been. She had lost sight of them over the past ten hours or so as the transport cruiser eventually outpaced her little borrowed shuttle. She had started to panic over getting lost out there. Now, she wasn't sure just \i what\i0  to think anymore.{&1310}\par But she started with the engines. They were glitching up on her, and it was hard to tell just what was wrong since the only thing the readout would say was "CATASTROPHIC DAMAGE".{&1310}\par A few minutes tinkering with it and her left hand got some control back in one of them. She eased that one in small bursts to turn the shuttle around. It was while she was slowly spinning it back toward open space, though, that she noticed the other ship out there.{&1310}\par Another cruiser. Sleek, and very much alive compared to the dead, bloated transport. Cannons and turrets dotted the black hull all over, almost invisible but for the dark splotch of absent stars behind. It hung there more than a hundred thousand kilometers away.{&1310}\par Tess froze. The engines died with her, and the shuttle stopped moving with a slow whine.{&1310}\par She wasn't stupid. That might have been the first time she ever left Riftwatch station, but she had seen enough vids and read enough of Ev's books to know a thing or two about what went on elsewhere in the system. And it didn't take her long to figure out that that other cruiser was a gunship.{&1310}\par Debris floated free through space around the transport. The other ship hovered where it was, keeping pace with the dead cruiser. Had it seen her? The one good palm was hot and clammy against the console as she stared out at the thing. It was eerily quiet. But if it could do that kind of damage to a ship as big as the transport cruiser, she had no doubts about what it could do to one rickety little shuttle.{&1310}\par She wasn't sure just how long she sat like that, waiting for one of those guns to flash before her whole world was vaporized in an instant. The moment didn't come. At least, not before something else started moving out of the corner of her eye.{&1310}\par A big slab of metal debris was wedged into the side of the transport cruiser. It rattled free, breaking off into space. Then it suddenly hummed to life and started spinning around. It took her a few, stunned seconds, but she realized it was another shuttle like hers.{&1310}\par The place where that other shuttle had broken free decompressed into space, vomiting out bits and pieces after it. Tess watched as it darted away, speeding towards that attack cruiser still hovering out of the way.
