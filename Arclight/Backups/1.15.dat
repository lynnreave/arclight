Soldiers, mostly -- marines and security bots that must have been counterattacking. But civilians too. People who'd gotten caught up in the crossfire.{&1310}\par I froze up outside the bay, locking eyes with a dead woman on the floor who'd been cleaved through the clavicle, nearly sawing her entire arm off from the shoulder. The pirates were fond of using molecular weapons in their boarding parties. Along with personal shield gens, it let them make short work of standard marine details without the newer close quarters combat arsenals. And those weapons weren't powered by shenlizite fuel cells.{&1310}\par That sight made me suddenly remember Bertram cutting of on the call. I didn't see some facelss stranger there on the floor anymore. I saw Tess.{&1310}\par "Keep moving!"{&1310}\par Miller grabbed me by the arm, nearly taking me off my feet as he pulled me into the corridor outside. I became aware of more fighting somewhere close by, but there was no way to tell with how the sounds bounced off the bulkheads around us. Riftwatch was a big station with thousands and thousands of personnel and residents aboard, but it was still hard to feel like anyone was left alive in all this mess of corpses and fighting. Only logic hissed at me that the attacking force was too small to kill everyone so fast without just blowing up the whole station. But that didn't make it any better.{&1310}\par Mills dragged me down one corridor I didn't recognize at first with all the dead and plasma-blackened walls and into another, pistol out and checking corners quickly as we went. He wasn't panicking or awkward. The Mills I'd known should have been. But this wasn't the Mills I knew.{&1310}\par I wondered, in a haze of shock and bewilderment from everything that had hust happened and \i been\i0  happening since I woke up missing chunks of memory, why he seemed to be trying to protect me instead of kidnap me like everyone else. Even Komi -- and that thought still didn't fit into my brain right. The other woman had taken me with psychokinesis and there hadn't been a damn thing I could do about it. That feeling of utter helplessness without even understanding why it was happening in the first place started to cast Mills in a much more favorable light by comparison. I hadn't seen it, but I was pretty sure the only reason I made it out of there was because of him. Like Kom, I supposed, he was much more powerful than he had ever let on at the Academy.{&1310}\par Like Komi. {&1310}\par \i "Don't call me that."\i0 {&1310}\par Or whoever the hell she was supposed to really be. I might have killed her with that knife.{&1310}\par And, like Komi, I had \i no\i0  idea why I was so important to him either. He said he would explain later, once we were away from the station. Why? Why was he acting like it was his \i mission\i0  to get me off that station?{&1310}\par Then I remembered what he'd said about one of the Grand Admirals. Which one? I couldn't remember. I hadn't been paying enough attention to \i that\i0  part of it. But if he wasn't lying about it, it \i did\i0  mean one of the admirals was making some sort of political move on the station. Who knew why -- certainly not \i me\i0  -- but that also meant I was either important to that admiral or someone working for him in order for all these people to be trying to kidnap me. And that probably meant Mills was working for one of the other ones -- one who, for some reason, didn't want the first admiral to get me. Not that that meant anything better to me at the moment. Who knew what \i that\i0  other admiral wanted with me? And why the \i hell\i0  were two admirals even fighting over me in the first place? It didn't make any fucking sense!{&1310}\par Those men had wanted me alive. Komi had wanted me alive. Mills too, even if he was being less violent about it. So far. Komi had been my best friend in my small, little world for six months without Tess, and that woman back there had been almost an entirely different person. Who \i else\i0  was going to suddenly pop up out of nowhere and tell me they were lying about who they really were all along? {&1310}\par Dad? {&1310}\par \i Bertram\i0 ? {&1310}\par ... Tess?{&1310}\par No. I could trust Tess. I \i had\i0  to. I'd known her too long for her to be anyone else but who she always had been, and I relaly needed some shred of sanity in all this mess right now. She couldn't be dead. She just couldn't be.{&1310}\par "We'll have to get over to the next closest bay that isn't already a warzone," Mills was whispering at me as he held back, glancing warily around into a thoroughfare that sounded like it had people moving along in there. He waited until the sound died off before pulling me out into the open with him. And I got a good eyeful of the dead and dying clogging the way ahead.{&1310}\par "Boarders are all over this part of the station so we'll have to move fast."{&1310}\par "Tess ..." {&1310}\par I opened my mouth, her name cracking as it came out as I smelled the thick scent of burning plasma and blood in the air.{&1310}\par "I have to find Tess."{&1310}\par Miller didn't even stop to look back at me while he said, "If we're going to risk finding \i anyone\i0  at all ... it's your father."{&1310}\par That threw me from the image of him as an agent for some other high-ranking officer trying to capture me for that one instead. Until I remembered that this had to have something to do with dad anyways. And Miller was a full-blooded psychokinetic too. He'd turned my misfires aside in the bay like someone with practice. He could just try to use me against dad before he even got me off the station.{&1310}\par It didn't quite fit. Not if I took his earnestness for what it was. But I still had no idea of his real reasons for dragging me out of here. I didn't want to die, but I wasn't about to leave Tess to either. I shook my head.{&1310}\par When Miller tried to pull me down a side corridor away from the thoroughfare, I took the chance to break free of him and break into a run ahead instead. I could find Bertram's -- where Tess would most likely be. I could lose Mills and hide.{&1310}\par I sprinted down the thoroughfare, leaping over bodies without seeing them for what they were. I made it about ten meters, flying like those things from the tower were right behind me again, before I felt a pulse round hit my back.{&1310}\par My whole body seized up and went numb. I twisted around, flying face-first into the deck, tumbling over legs and arms from dead marines as I went. And I thought, for a split second before I finally hit the ground, that Mills had killed me rather than let me escape. If the stakes were that high, I'd been screwed from the start.{&1310}\par I came to rest, the wind knocked out of me so hard that I couldn't even gag on the smell of burned flesh. It wasn't mine, though. My head spun, but my nerves were dead around that spot where he'd shot me. I knew what a stun round felt like. The Academy had made sure of that liberally in training.{&1310}\par I was lying on the deck on my stomach still when someone finally came up behind me. {&1310}\par "I'm sorry, Evelyn," the man was saying. I numbly felt his hands reach down and hoist me up from the floor.{&1310}\par "\i Fuck\i0  you, Mills!" I snarled back athim through clenched teeth squashed flat against the deck.{&1310}\par He picked my limp, seizing body up and threw it over his shoulders in the trooper carry like they'd had us do in training a thousand times before. I'd had to run with Komi on my back like that for so long sometimes I'd felt like I would die. But I was no trouble for Mills, apparently. Just inconvenient. He turned back and made his way to that other corridor with me in tow like before, only this time I couldn't exactly say no.\cf2\f1 {&1310}\par }{&1310}

Everything upended in a sudden, violent outcry of grinding steel and flashing red lgihts. It flung her back up and over the chair into the deck. She crashed into a shoulder, and flopped over onto her stomach. And the rest of the shuttle came raining down on top.{&1310}\par Vertigo. She lay there on the floor for a moment as the whole shuttle spun, alarms blaring and trying to snatch her up towards the wall. It rained random garbage, and a low whirring started to crescendo. Sparks popped, crackled, and danced across panels. It was a wonder nothing caught on fire. And, all the while, a sharp, brain-numbing pain was screaming and swallowing her in white noise from that one shoulder.{&1310}\par Eventually, she realized her mouth was open. She squeezed it shut, clenching her teeth instead. Found her good hand, and pushed up from the deck with it. The shuttle knocked her back over. And then she half-crawled, half-slid along the metal floor toward the pilot's chair with her bad arm cradled close into her stomach.{&1310}\par A hand crept up the console and managed to kill the engines with a few clumsy slaps. It took another minute for the thing to stop spinning. Longer still for the dizziness to pass. She waited.{&1310}\par The shuttle was drifting fast when she climbed back into the chair, hunching over her numb arm. A couple sporadic bursts from the engines slowed it down. They were malfunctioning, though. The readout told her that much at least. That thing had clocked her pretty good.{&1310}\par If she had thought to spend any more time worrying about that, though, she was wrong. When she glanced up towards the forward view again, she stopped dead in her tracks.{&1310}\par A ship loomed out there. A huge cruiser that blotted out the stars all around.{&1310}\par She was close. A few thousand klicks at most. And that hull was almost flat against her forward port. If she hadn;t stopped when she did ...{&1310}\par It was barely moving. The hull was dark from what she could see, and the whole thing looked dead in space. She tried to peek around but it was almost impossible to tell if it was the same ship. She was sure, though. There wasn't much chance it could be anything else out there just then.{&1310}\par Ev and old Weir were on that ship. At least, they had been. She had lost sight of them over the past ten hours or so as the transport cruiser eventually outpaced her little borrowed shuttle. She had started to panic over getting lost out there. Now, she wasn't sure just \i what\i0  to think anymore.{&1310}\par But she started with the engines. They were glitching up on her, and it was hard to tell just what was wrong since the only thing the readout would say was "CATASTROPHIC DAMAGE".{&1310}\par A few minutes tinkering with it and her left hand got some control back in one of them. She eased that one in small bursts to turn the shuttle around. It was while she was slowly spinning it back toward open space, though, that she noticed the other ship out there.{&1310}\par Another cruiser. Sleek, and very much alive compared to the dead, bloated transport. Cannons and turrets dotted the black hull all over, almost invisible but for the dark splotch of absent stars behind. It hung there more than a hundred thousand kilometers away.{&1310}\par Tess froze. The engines died with her, and the shuttle stopped moving with a slow whine.{&1310}\par She wasn't stupid. That might have been the first time she ever left Riftwatch station, but she had seen enough vids and read enough of Ev's books to know a thing or two about what went on elsewhere in the system. And it didn't take her long to figure out that that other cruiser was a gunship.{&1310}\par Debris floated free through space around the transport. The other ship hovered where it was, keeping pace with the dead cruiser. Had it seen her? The one good palm was hot and clammy against the console as she stared out at the thing. It was eerily quiet. But if it could do that kind of damage to a ship as big as the transport cruiser, she had no doubts about what it could do to one rickety little shuttle.{&1310}\par She wasn't sure just how long she sat like that, waiting for one of those guns to flash before her whole world was vaporized in an instant. The moment didn't come. At least, not before something else started moving out of the corner of her eye.{&1310}\par A big slab of metal debris was wedged into the side of the transport cruiser. It rattled free, breaking off into space. Then it suddenly hummed to life and started spinning around. It took her a few, stunned seconds, but she realized it was another shuttle like hers.{&1310}\par The place where that other shuttle had broken free decompressed into space, vomiting out bits and pieces after it. Tess watched as it darted away, speeding towards that attack cruiser still hovering out of the way. And that was when she noticed some of those bits flying after it were corpses.\cf2\f2 {&1310}\par }{&1310}
