Rancid water crashed down from its face, plastered black with slime, sludge, and the grime in its scalp. It gasped out loud like some half-drowned corpse, gagging on the thick air. There was too much of it, and not enough. The whole thing just shook with the shock of that sudden life.{&1310}\par It was a girl.{&1310}\par The man who had snatched that girl’s head back out of the river shallows let her go. He pulled his hand back from the slimy, ragged mass of her tangled hair, and couldn’t help wincing as he smeared it against the side of his dirty coat. She pitched forward back toward the murky water, but caught herself just before falling in again.{&1310}\par “What the hell is it, Brennan?”{&1310}\par Someone else was edging up behind him. But the man ignored that harsh whisper for a moment, just staring. The girl was choking on her lungs there in the grass and reeds. He could still make her out easily in the sliver of moonlight that lanced through the clouds and dark branches above. She ignored him too.{&1310}\par The other growled loudly in his throat, and started trudging his way toward Brennan at the shallows’ edge. He opened his mouth to say something more - but caught himself up instantly at the sight of that woman in the mud.{&1310}\par “God, is that ...?” he trailed off, almost too quiet to hear.{&1310}\par They stared at the woman. She stared down into the black water. Night had come on some time ago, and silence hung all too thick in the heavy air. That woman started laughing - low, and quiet.{&1310}\par “Brennan! Liam! Goddamnit, we need to move!”{&1310}\par One of the others was hissing at them from back through the reeds towards the treeline. Two more lingered in that one’s wake, shifting uneasily there in the dark. There was not another living thing to make a sound around them for what seemed like miles. No birds. No crickets. Not even croaking frogs along the river.{&1310}\par “Let’s go!” {&1310}\par Liam was digging his fingers into the other man’s arm. Brennan glanced back at him. Then again, down at the girl. She had managed to keep her face just out of the water long enough to remember how to breathe without it in her lungs.{&1310}\par “What about her?” he gestured down at the girl.{&1310}\par Liam didn’t even look at the woman. He just started pulling the other man away.{&1310}\par “Forget about her!” he snarled back at him. “We have to leave now!”{&1310}\par “Hey, you two better move goddamnit!”{&1310}\par Brennan shook himself roughly free of Liam’s clutching hand, and jumped back down into the stagnant water beside the girl.{&1310}\par “Get up,” he told her, pulling her up anyways by the shoulders. She didn’t resist, and he shoved her back onto shore, sloshing too loudly through the water.{&1310}\par “I don’t care who you are, but you can’t stay out here alone,” he tried to chide her, but felt hollow even at that. It was hard to get out of his head just how dead she had looked when he had found her floating in the dank waters.{&1310}\par “It’s not safe.”{&1310}\par Liam had already spun back away toward the others. They were moving. Hurried footsteps creaked through the dead forest anew. Brennan just prodded that comatose girl, stumbling along, as quickly as he could.{&1310}\par The undergrowth should have been thick, but was not. Not with that black decay that hung over everything so thick instead. Even dragging her feet, the girl managed to keep pace, though Brennan had a firm hand on the small of her back pushing her headlong forward. She barely seemed aware at all, muddling on like the corpse he was sure she had been. Maybe it wasn’t just his imagination. She was mumbling a little to herself.{&1310}\par One of the others - Shawn - glanced back just long enough to get a look at what had kept them.{&1310}\par “You’ve gotta be kidding me.”{&1310}\par He opened his mouth to say something more. But Evetts up front stopped them with a warning hand.{&1310}\par “Hold up,” Dustan repeated just barely loud enough for them to hear. He made a subtle gesture back at them, almost invisible in the dark. And they paused.{&1310}\par Silence.{&1310}\par Brennan held his breath. The girl didn’t. Liam had his eyes darting every which way. Not that it would have done them a whole lot of good in the dark. Brennan left it up to his ears. Shawn had a hand buried beneath his coat, staring.{&1310}\par More silence.{&1310}\par “Do you see anything?”{&1310}\par The girl was still muttering.{&1310}\par “Shut the fuck up!”{&1310}\par “There.”{&1310}\par Liam was pointing. Shawn spun around that way, hand still inside his coat. So did the others. Brennan just squinted after them.{&1310}\par “Over there.”{&1310}\par They were all still. Staring.{&1310}\par Silence.{&1310}\par Shawn had started, slowly, to pull that hand free.{&1310}\par Then something whispered in his ear.{&1310}\par The man came whipping back around with his hand out and pointed away behind. Light flared ahead of his fingers. It exploded out, bursting into the trees. Then it turned to fire.{&1310}\par Whatever was there, it scattered into smoke, and vanished just as quickly as the burst of light. A chunk of bark was torn away and smoldering, glimmering in the gloom. It was hard to tell if that was what made that sudden hissing noise.{&1310}\par They all were quiet again after that for some time.{&1310}\par “Did you get it?” someone finally breathed.{&1310}\par And then that hissing finally stopped.{&1310}\par The embers died out.{&1310}\par And the clicking started.{&1310}\par “Run.”{&1310}\par Someone said it. He wasn’t sure who. But Liam was already moving.{&1310}\par Brennan didn’t waste a second trying to prod the catatonic girl - he just caught her by the arm and under one leg and slung her over his back. Shawn started backpedaling slowly, picking up speed as he came back around, still staring off. Dustan and Evetts had the lead on him by several seconds.{&1310}\par They all took off into the forest. Away from that clicking.{&1310}\par Branches scratched at Brennan’s face as he ran. He threw one hand out for balance, as much to ward them away as to keep from running headlong into a tree as he lumbered along with the breath rattling in his ears. The others were shouting elsewhere, closeby. Dirt and brush kicked up everywhere loudly, all hope for silence and hiding shattered in an instant. The moon broke through above a few times, and just as quickly died. Not that there was ever much to see but dead growth and broken trees.{&1310}\par The clicking was bad. But the whispers were worse. {&1310}\par Much worse.{&1310}\par Dead leaves and pine needles cracked underfoot. The air was damp, and sticking. A fog lingered somewhere ahead. He could feel himself run right into it. Someone shouted something about that, but he couldn’t hear over the sound of blood thumping in his veins.{&1310}\par The voices came through. At least, he thought they were voices. Whatever they were saying, it was beyond him - low, and insidious, deep in the back of his skull. They made it hard to concentrate. Thankfully, there was only one thing he could think to do.{&1310}\par Run.{&1310}\par But it got closer. Just like before. And there weren't so much left now.{&1310}\par He started to flag, and a surge of desperation at that drove him just a little bit harder. The girl was weighing down like an anvil on his back, but he didn’t drop her just yet. He plodded on hurriedly a few dozen more steps and . . .{&1310}\par Came up short.{&1310}\par Dustan nearly blew a hole right through his head when he did. The man had his firebolt aimed right at the space between the trees where Brennan came stumbling leadenly through. As it was, he managed to duck aside. The blast slipped clean past the girl as well, lighting up a strip of bark and bouncing off into the night behind.{&1310}\par He didn’t even have the breath to shout at the man. As it was, Liam snatched one of his arms and hauled him back up to his feet and into their little circle.{&1310}\par Each of the other four men had his own piece in hand, pointed haphazardly off into the still, dark forest. The whispering was catching up. So was the clicking. Nothing else moved.{&1310}\par “Come on, Brennan!” Liam was snapping at him as he pulled the man up toward a broken tree at their center. “Move your ass, god damnit!”{&1310}\par The others pulled back around him, still aiming away. There was the brief thought in his head that they should never have stopped moving. Even for him. {&1310}\par But then it was gone.{&1310}\par Still - one of them didn’t quite make it.{&1310}\par Evetts spared the two and the girl one glance back over his shoulder. He opened his mouth to say something, but never got it out. The sound caught in his throat instead, like he was gagging on his tongue. Liam blinked at him, unregistering. Then something punched right up out Evett’s back through the chest.{&1310}\par Liam didn’t see what it was. And neither did Evetts. The dead man just slowly came back around, his pale face painted incredulous. He flew away into the night.{&1310}\par Liam started firing wildly after. So did Dustan. Shawn held back, poised and watching.{&1310}\par Brennan caught that dead tree ahead in one hand without Liam’s help, and pulled himself up onto the mound. The other man was roaring, bellowing out after Evetts into the night. Brennan finally slipped the girl around and dropped her down to the ground. She rolled back against the blackened bark, still seeming more than a little dazed and clueless.{&1310}\par “Hey!” he tried to slap her on the side of the face a few times. That seemed to bring a bit of sense back to her. The others were firing desperately into the black wood behind. Brennan pulled out his own beaten-up little handcannon, and cocked it, peeking inside. Still some juice left.{&1310}\par The girl managed to blink up at him as he slapped it back home.{&1310}\par “Who are you?”{&1310}\par He ignored her. “Just ... Stay here!” he grunted through his teeth, pocking the last few rounds he had left and pressing a firm hand down hard on her shoulder. He scurried back up around the trunk of the tree before she could say anything else - glanced around back to the others.{&1310}\par “Over here!” both Liam and Dustan were shouting at the same time from opposite sides of that small, dark clearing. The fog had crept in, and they were firing blindly into the shadows and mist. Shawn was behind and between them, aiming from first one, then the other, then anywhere else in between.{&1310}\par Something caught Dustan’s leg. He cried out, and it came off at the knee. The pitch went shrill as he started to topple, shots going wide. Two holes appeared in stomach and chest, and he lost an arm. Whatever was left of him pitched into the dirt, twitching. Then it was snatched away.{&1310}\par Brennan could hear that fresh corpse scraping suddenly against the dirt even if he couldn’t see it. Liam and Shawn were both firing now, right where Dustan had been. Something shrieked in response, but it was hard to tell if they had hit. So they just kept shooting.{&1310}\par Brennan joined in, adding a shout with the sudden whooomp of his cannon along with Liam’s for good measure. The other man was howling like mad now and thrusting his rifle that way like he might stab it right through whatever it was that had taken Evetts and Dustan. It was the only reason Brennan knew when it had gotten him too. That bellowing roar suddenly cut short.{&1310}\par Liam’s head was gone. Even with all that light flashing around the forest like fireflies in a bowl of pitch, Brennan couldn’t see just how it had happen. The body kept firing, though, finger twitching sporadically and arm swinging wide. It came up toward him back up the mound, and he leapt into the dirt just as a bit of fire and light clipped his shoulder. As it was, the tree behind him with the girl nearly split in two, sprinkling him with a swarm of ash and smoldering cinders.{&1310}\par Shawn’s weapon clicked empty a few times before he registered it, echoing loudly like clanging bells in the night. He had taken a knee, hoping for some leverage in aim. Not that there was anything to aim at really. Now his eyes flashed wide. Still, he kept trying to fire for several more seconds before it finally sunk it.{&1310}\par “FUCK!”{&1310}\par A hand vanished inside his coat. It came back out with a fistful of rounds, most of them scattering into the dirt and dark his fingers were shaking so much. He did manage to get one of them into the chamber.{&1310}\par “Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!”{&1310}\par His firebolt sang as it loaded. It was the most beautiful sound a man could have heard just then. Or ever, for that matter. And he raised it again toward that creeping dark.{&1310}\par Brennan was back up on one knee, coughing up bits of burning wood and the smell of dead meat. Just in time to see Shawn look sharply to one side and try to twist that way almost as fast. He didn’t quite make it. Not before another something had rushed right in and taken the top half of him away into the night.{&1310}\par He froze. For one, terrible moment - there was only the rush of blood to his head as he watched the remainder of Shawn twitch into the ground. There was nothing else. No bolts of fire. No bodies. No sounds but that clicking in the dark. It was everywhere.{&1310}\par He blinked back toward the tree. The girl. She was still hidden behind it where he had left her. Quiet still. Hidden. He hoped.{&1310}\par It was an easy choice. The only one he had left, really.{&1310}\par He ran.{&1310}\par But he didn’t get far.{&1310}\par His feet took off at a dead sprint through the dark in the opposite way, cutting just past where the others had gone and those things had come. He took off away from the tree and the girl. He clutched the barrel of his cannon in one hand and ran as hard as he could, despite the dark. Dead brush and scuffed boots sang in the fog.{&1310}\par He didn’t get far.{&1310}\par Down the hill, through a few clusters of trees and dead roots. Past whipping, brittle branches and clicking bark. He managed to get a hundred feet or so. Then something took one of his legs right out from under him.{&1310}\par He flew up into the air and the world slowed as he did. Too much adrenaline and the beginnings of a brief vision of desperate clarity. Then he went face first into the dirt and a loose round exploded out from the barrel by his twitchy finger. The force of it sent him tumbling headlong over the other way.{&1310}\par He hit the ground on his back, arm numb. Whatever it had been, it wasn’t a root. He knew that. It had torn him clean up from the ground by one ankle like he weighed no more than a feather. And his whole body had twisted around into it.{&1310}\par The leg was still there. Both of them. {&1310}\par So was the clicking. It started to hiss in his ear.{&1310}\par And he was crawling quickly away again.{&1310}\par He made it a few dozen more feet. He thought. It took a few seconds, but the sharp, stinging pain finally caught up with his arm where it had all but been wrenched out of the socket. He gritted his teeth, biting back. Then something gouged his left calf.{&1310}\par There was the shrill cry of something in the wood. It took him a moment, but he realized it was him. He threw the cannon in his limp arm back around behind him, snatching the trigger with his other good hand.{&1310}\par WHOOOMP.{&1310}\par A ball of flame exploded away wildly into the night, blinding him. And so did that thing. It was a wonder he didn’t suddenly feel his legs come away with it.{&1310}\par He was free again. Enough to launch himself back up to his feet and glance back behind. There was nothing there, though. Nothing, but the ragged sound of his breathing in the dark.{&1310}\par Another blast fired off behind him for good measure.{&1310}\par He limped away, bleeding down his leg. It was a useless effort, though. Whatever those things were, they were on top of him already. That clicking and hissing and whispering had already burrowed deep down into the back of his skull and was starting to eat out his brain.{&1310}\par He just kept firing back. Until there was nothing left.{&1310}\par And then he threw the gun.{&1310}\par His good foot caught empty air where there should have been ground. It sent him twisting wildly around and forward. Just before he could fall, though, something stabbed right through his chest, sticking him fast.{&1310}\par Another shrill cry shot past his lips, and he was goggling down at that something sticking right through one side of him. It was long, and slender like a blade. But there was life in it. He could feel it ebbing just past his lung.{&1310}\par And he could feel it as he snatched the thing in his one good hand, howling out through his teeth. He pushed it back out and away from him. Or tried to. Rather, he slid himself back out around it.{&1310}\par This time something snatched in for his head. He was already falling backwards, though, clutching at that hole in flesh and bone stuck right through beneath his shoulder. It swiped him across the other arm - the broken one. Slicing open shoulder and more sodden flesh. His whole body twisted back around as he plummeted over and down. {&1310}\par He waited for the ground to come up to meet him, but it never did. Instead, there was only empty air. And the rush of cool wind.{&1310}\par And then there was only black.{&1310}\par }{&1310}

Even with all that light flashing around the forest like fireflies in a bowl of pitch, Brennan couldn’t see just how it had happen. The body kept firing, though, finger twitching sporadically and arm swinging wide. It came up toward him back up the mound, and he leapt into the dirt just as a bit of fire and light clipped his shoulder. As it was, the tree behind him with the girl nearly split in two, sprinkling him with a swarm of ash and smoldering cinders.{&1310}\par Shawn’s weapon clicked empty a few times before he registered it, echoing loudly like clanging bells in the night. He had taken a knee, hoping for some leverage in aim. Not that there was anything to aim at really. Now his eyes flashed wide. Still, he kept trying to fire for several more seconds before it finally sunk it.{&1310}\par “FUCK!”{&1310}\par A hand vanished inside his coat. It came back out with a fistful of rounds, most of them scattering into the dirt and dark his fingers were shaking so much. He did manage to get one of them into the chamber.{&1310}\par “Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!”{&1310}\par His firebolt sang as it loaded. It was the most beautiful sound a man could have heard just then. Or ever, for that matter. And he raised it again toward that creeping dark.{&1310}\par Brennan was back up on one knee, coughing up bits of burning wood and the smell of dead meat. Just in time to see Shawn look sharply to one side and try to twist that way almost as fast. He didn’t quite make it. Not before another something had rushed right in and taken the top half of him away into the night.{&1310}\par He froze. For one, terrible moment - there was only the rush of blood to his head as he watched the remainder of Shawn twitch into the ground. There was nothing else. No bolts of fire. No bodies. No sounds but that clicking in the dark. It was everywhere.{&1310}\par He blinked back toward the tree. The girl. She was still hidden behind it where he had left her. Quiet still. Hidden. He hoped.{&1310}\par It was an easy choice. The only one he had left, really.{&1310}\par He ran.{&1310}\par But he didn’t get far.{&1310}\par His feet took off at a dead sprint through the dark in the opposite way, cutting just past where the others had gone and those things had come. He took off away from the tree and the girl. He clutched the barrel of his cannon in one hand and ran as hard as he could, despite the dark. Dead brush and scuffed boots sang in the fog.{&1310}\par He didn’t get far.{&1310}\par Down the hill, through a few clusters of trees and dead roots. Past whipping, brittle branches and clicking bark. He managed to get a hundred feet or so. Then something took one of his legs right out from under him.{&1310}\par He flew up into the air and the world slowed as he did. Too much adrenaline and the beginnings of a brief vision of desperate clarity. Then he went face first into the dirt and a loose round exploded out from the barrel by his twitchy finger. The force of it sent him tumbling headlong over the other way.{&1310}\par He hit the ground on his back, arm numb. Whatever it had been, it wasn’t a root. He knew that. It had torn him clean up from the ground by one ankle like he weighed no more than a feather. And his whole body had twisted around into it.{&1310}\par The leg was still there. Both of them. {&1310}\par So was the clicking. It started to hiss in his ear.{&1310}\par And he was crawling quickly away again.{&1310}\par He made it a few dozen more feet. He thought. It took a few seconds, but the sharp, stinging pain finally caught up with his arm where it had all but been wrenched out of the socket. He gritted his teeth, biting back. Then something gouged his left calf.{&1310}\par There was the shrill cry of something in the wood. It took him a moment, but he realized it was him. He threw the cannon in his limp arm back around behind him, snatching the trigger with his other good hand.{&1310}\par WHOOOMP.{&1310}\par A ball of flame exploded away wildly into the night, blinding him. And so did that thing. It was a wonder he didn’t suddenly feel his legs come away with it.{&1310}\par He was free again. Enough to launch himself back up to his feet and glance back behind. There was nothing there, though. Nothing, but the ragged sound of his breathing in the dark.{&1310}\par Another blast fired off behind him for good measure.{&1310}\par He limped away, bleeding down his leg. It was a useless effort, though. Whatever those things were, they were on top of him already. That clicking and hissing and whispering had already burrowed deep down into the back of his skull and was starting to eat out his brain.{&1310}\par He just kept firing back. Until there was nothing left.{&1310}\par And then he threw the gun.{&1310}\par His good foot caught empty air where there should have been ground. It sent him twisting wildly around and forward. Just before he could fall, though, something stabbed right through his chest, sticking him fast.{&1310}\par Another shrill cry shot past his lips, and he was goggling down at that something sticking right through one side of him. It was long, and slender like a blade. But there was life in it. He could feel it ebbing just past his lung.{&1310}\par And he could feel it as he snatched the thing in his one good hand, howling out through his teeth. He pushed it back out and away from him. Or tried to. Rather, he slid himself back out around it.{&1310}\par This time something snatched in for his head. He was already falling backwards, though, clutching at that hole in flesh and bone stuck right through beneath his shoulder. It swiped him across the other arm - the broken one. Slicing open shoulder and more sodden flesh. His whole body twisted back around as he plummeted over and down. {&1310}\par He waited for the ground to come up to meet him, but it never did. Instead, there was only empty air. And the rush of cool wind.{&1310}\par And then there was only black.{&1310}\par }{&1310}

Rancid water crashed down from its face, plastered black with slime, sludge, and the grime in its scalp. It gasped out loud like some half-drowned corpse, gagging on the thick air. There was too much of it, and not enough. The whole thing just shook with the shock of that sudden life.{&1310}\par It was a girl.{&1310}\par The man who had snatched that girl’s head back out of the river shallows let her go. He pulled his hand back from the slimy, ragged mass of her tangled hair, and couldn’t help wincing as he smeared it against the side of his dirty coat. She pitched forward back toward the murky water, but caught herself just before falling in again.{&1310}\par “What the hell is it, Brennan?”{&1310}\par Someone else was edging up behind him. But the man ignored that harsh whisper for a moment, just staring. The girl was choking on her lungs there in the grass and reeds. He could still make her out easily in the sliver of moonlight that lanced through the clouds and dark branches above. She ignored him too.{&1310}\par The other growled loudly in his throat, and started trudging his way toward Brennan at the shallows’ edge. He opened his mouth to say something more - but caught himself up instantly at the sight of that woman in the mud.{&1310}\par “God, is that ...?” he trailed off, almost too quiet to hear.{&1310}\par They stared at the woman. She stared down into the black water. Night had come on some time ago, and silence hung all too thick in the heavy air. That woman started laughing - low, and quiet.{&1310}\par “Brennan! Liam! Goddamnit, we need to move!”{&1310}\par One of the others was hissing at them from back through the reeds towards the treeline. Two more lingered in that one’s wake, shifting uneasily there in the dark. There was not another living thing to make a sound around them for what seemed like miles. No birds. No crickets. Not even croaking frogs along the river.{&1310}\par “Let’s go!” {&1310}\par Liam was digging his fingers into the other man’s arm. Brennan glanced back at him. Then again, down at the girl. She had managed to keep her face just out of the water long enough to remember how to breathe without it in her lungs.{&1310}\par “What about her?” he gestured down at the girl.{&1310}\par Liam didn’t even look at the woman. He just started pulling the other man away.{&1310}\par “Forget about her!” he snarled back at him. “We have to leave now!”{&1310}\par “Hey, you two better move goddamnit!”{&1310}\par Brennan shook himself roughly free of Liam’s clutching hand, and jumped back down into the stagnant water beside the girl.{&1310}\par “Get up,” he told her, pulling her up anyways by the shoulders. She didn’t resist, and he shoved her back onto shore, sloshing too loudly through the water.{&1310}\par “I don’t care who you are, but you can’t stay out here alone,” he tried to chide her, but felt hollow even at that. It was hard to get out of his head just how dead she had looked when he had found her floating in the dank waters.{&1310}\par “It’s not safe.”{&1310}\par Liam had already spun back away toward the others. They were moving. Hurried footsteps creaked through the dead forest anew. Brennan just prodded that comatose girl, stumbling along, as quickly as he could.{&1310}\par The undergrowth should have been thick, but was not. Not with that black decay that hung over everything so thick instead. Even dragging her feet, the girl managed to keep pace, though Brennan had a firm hand on the small of her back pushing her headlong forward. She barely seemed aware at all, muddling on like the corpse he was sure she had been. Maybe it wasn’t just his imagination. She was mumbling a little to herself.{&1310}\par One of the others - Shawn - glanced back just long enough to get a look at what had kept them.{&1310}\par “You’ve gotta be kidding me.”{&1310}\par He opened his mouth to say something more. But Evetts up front stopped them with a warning hand.{&1310}\par “Hold up,” Dustan repeated just barely loud enough for them to hear. He made a subtle gesture back at them, almost invisible in the dark. And they paused.{&1310}\par Silence.{&1310}\par Brennan held his breath. The girl didn’t. Liam had his eyes darting every which way. Not that it would have done them a whole lot of good in the dark. Brennan left it up to his ears. Shawn had a hand buried beneath his coat, staring.{&1310}\par More silence.{&1310}\par “Do you see anything?”{&1310}\par The girl was still muttering.{&1310}\par “Shut the fuck up!”{&1310}\par “There.”{&1310}\par Liam was pointing. Shawn spun around that way, hand still inside his coat. So did the others. Brennan just squinted after them.{&1310}\par “Over there.”{&1310}\par They were all still. Staring.{&1310}\par Silence.{&1310}\par Shawn had started, slowly, to pull that hand free.{&1310}\par Then something whispered in his ear.{&1310}\par The man came whipping back around with his hand out and pointed away behind. Light flared ahead of his fingers. It exploded out, bursting into the trees. Then it turned to fire.{&1310}\par Whatever was there, it scattered into smoke, and vanished just as quickly as the burst of light. A chunk of bark was torn away and smoldering, glimmering in the gloom. It was hard to tell if that was what made that sudden hissing noise.{&1310}\par They all were quiet again after that for some time.{&1310}\par “Did you get it?” someone finally breathed.{&1310}\par And then that hissing finally stopped.{&1310}\par The embers died out.{&1310}\par And the clicking started.{&1310}\par “Run.”{&1310}\par Someone said it. He wasn’t sure who. But Liam was already moving.{&1310}\par Brennan didn’t waste a second trying to prod the catatonic girl - he just caught her by the arm and under one leg and slung her over his back. Shawn started backpedaling slowly, picking up speed as he came back around, still staring off. Dustan and Evetts had the lead on him by several seconds.{&1310}\par They all took off into the forest. Away from that clicking.{&1310}\par Branches scratched at Brennan’s face as he ran. He threw one hand out for balance, as much to ward them away as to keep from running headlong into a tree as he lumbered along with the breath rattling in his ears. The others were shouting elsewhere, closeby. Dirt and brush kicked up everywhere loudly, all hope for silence and hiding shattered in an instant. The moon broke through above a few times, and just as quickly died. Not that there was ever much to see but dead growth and broken trees.{&1310}\par The clicking was bad. But the whispers were worse. {&1310}\par Much worse.{&1310}\par Dead leaves and pine needles cracked underfoot. The air was damp, and sticking. A fog lingered somewhere ahead. He could feel himself run right into it. Someone shouted something about that, but he couldn’t hear over the sound of blood thumping in his veins.{&1310}\par The voices came through. At least, he thought they were voices. Whatever they were saying, it was beyond him - low, and insidious, deep in the back of his skull. They made it hard to concentrate. Thankfully, there was only one thing he could think to do.{&1310}\par Run.{&1310}\par But it got closer. Just like before. And there weren't so much left now.{&1310}\par He started to flag, and a surge of desperation at that drove him just a little bit harder. The girl was weighing down like an anvil on his back, but he didn’t drop her just yet. He plodded on hurriedly a few dozen more steps and . . .{&1310}\par Came up short.{&1310}\par Dustan nearly blew a hole right through his head when he did. The man had his firebolt aimed right at the space between the trees where Brennan came stumbling leadenly through. As it was, he managed to duck aside. The blast slipped clean past the girl as well, lighting up a strip of bark and bouncing off into the night behind.{&1310}\par He didn’t even have the breath to shout at the man. As it was, Liam snatched one of his arms and hauled him back up to his feet and into their little circle.{&1310}\par Each of the other four men had his own piece in hand, pointed haphazardly off into the still, dark forest. The whispering was catching up. So was the clicking. Nothing else moved.{&1310}\par “Come on, Brennan!” Liam was snapping at him as he pulled the man up toward a broken tree at their center. “Move your ass, god damnit!”{&1310}\par The others pulled back around him, still aiming away. There was the brief thought in his head that they should never have stopped moving. Even for him. {&1310}\par But then it was gone.{&1310}\par Still - one of them didn’t quite make it.{&1310}\par Evetts spared the two and the girl one glance back over his shoulder. He opened his mouth to say something, but never got it out. The sound caught in his throat instead, like he was gagging on his tongue. Liam blinked at him, unregistering. Then something punched right up out Evett’s back through the chest.{&1310}\par Liam didn’t see what it was. And neither did Evetts. The dead man just slowly came back around, his pale face painted incredulous. He flew away into the night.{&1310}\par Liam started firing wildly after. So did Dustan. Shawn held back, poised and watching.{&1310}\par Brennan caught that dead tree ahead in one hand without Liam’s help, and pulled himself up onto the mound. The other man was roaring, bellowing out after Evetts into the night. Brennan finally slipped the girl around and dropped her down to the ground. She rolled back against the blackened bark, still seeming more than a little dazed and clueless.{&1310}\par “Hey!” he tried to slap her on the side of the face a few times. That seemed to bring a bit of sense back to her. The others were firing desperately into the black wood behind. Brennan pulled out his own beaten-up little handcannon, and cocked it, peeking inside. Still some juice left.{&1310}\par The girl managed to blink up at him as he slapped it back home.{&1310}\par “Who are you?”{&1310}\par He ignored her. “Just ... Stay here!” he grunted through his teeth, pocking the last few rounds he had left and pressing a firm hand down hard on her shoulder. He scurried back up around the trunk of the tree before she could say anything else - glanced around back to the others.{&1310}\par “Over here!” both Liam and Dustan were shouting at the same time from opposite sides of that small, dark clearing. The fog had crept in, and they were firing blindly into the shadows and mist. Shawn was behind and between them, aiming from first one, then the other, then anywhere else in between.{&1310}\par Something caught Dustan’s leg. He cried out, and it came off at the knee. The pitch went shrill as he started to topple, shots going wide. Two holes appeared in stomach and chest, and he lost an arm. Whatever was left of him pitched into the dirt, twitching. Then it was snatched away.{&1310}\par Brennan could hear that fresh corpse scraping suddenly against the dirt even if he couldn’t see it. Liam and Shawn were both firing now, right where Dustan had been. Something shrieked in response, but it was hard to tell if they had hit. So they just kept shooting.{&1310}\par Brennan joined in, adding a shout with the sudden whooomp of his cannon along with Liam’s for good measure. The other man was howling like mad now and thrusting his rifle that way like he might stab it right through whatever it was that had taken Evetts and Dustan. It was the only reason Brennan knew when it had gotten him too. That bellowing roar suddenly cut short.{&1310}\par Liam’s head was gone. Even with all that light flashing around the forest like fireflies in a bowl of pitch, Brennan couldn’t see just how it had happen. The body kept firing, though, finger twitching sporadically and arm swinging wide. It came up toward him back up the mound, and he leapt into the dirt just as a bit of fire and light clipped his shoulder. As it was, the tree behind him with the girl nearly split in two, sprinkling him with a swarm of ash and smoldering cinders.{&1310}\par Shawn’s weapon clicked empty a few times before he registered it, echoing loudly like clanging bells in the night. He had taken a knee, hoping for some leverage in aim. Not that there was anything to aim at really. Now his eyes flashed wide. Still, he kept trying to fire for several more seconds before it finally sunk it.{&1310}\par “FUCK!”{&1310}\par A hand vanished inside his coat. It came back out with a fistful of rounds, most of them scattering into the dirt and dark his fingers were shaking so much. He did manage to get one of them into the chamber.{&1310}\par “Fuck! Fuck!
