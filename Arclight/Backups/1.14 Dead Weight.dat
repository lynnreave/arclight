Fitzpatrick snapped again.{&1310}\par And they gave me the same leery eye as the bay manager when they got close.{&1310}\par "What the hell happened to \i her\i0 ?"{&1310}\par "Where's Thaddeus?" Fitzpatrick ignored him, forcing me to shrug out of the rumpled, beaten up pack on my back. I managed to get down to my knees on the deck, but he wasn't letting me lie all the way down.{&1310}\par One of the two shrugged.{&1310}\par "Well, I saw him over near one of the shuttles. Go get him!"{&1310}\par The bay manager waved a hand that way.{&1310}\par "Hey. Hey!" I felt his hands trying to squeeze my arms, and he was moving his head to keep pace with my drooping eyes. Somehow, I was almost all the way down to the ground. He was gingerly holding my head up again.{&1310}\par "Stay with me, kid."{&1310}\par Another old man swam into view beyond Fitzpatrick at some point. This one was dressed in a long, elegant red coat over his clothes. He dipped his craggly face and white beard in where I could see it.{&1310}\par "Found her just like this, Thaddeus," the bay manager's voice floated about the head of the old man. "Came wandering in without a word to anyone until we caught her."{&1310}\par That old man stared at me for a moment. Thaddeus. The Head Archivist of Riftwatch. The thought that he was the last person on the station to be down there came slowly, inching across my brain. I blinked back up at him. {&1310}\par Then someone else was at his side. He glanced that way.{&1310}\par "I think you've run out of time," the head archivist said, rasping out in his impossibly calm voice. "Wouldn't you agree?" {&1310}\par It felt like the whole world was spinning on its side. For some reason, it only bothered me, though.{&1310}\par That other someone was too busy looking at me. And I just got a glimpse of him before winking out completely.{&1310}\par "He was right," that one said. {&1310}\par Then I was gone.\cf2\f1 {&1310}\par }{&1310}
