He was out cold alright. I snatched back my - I mean Ev's - gun. And I pistol-whipped him across the face just like you saw in the vids. You know ... just in case.{&1310}\par I had gotten lucky when he didn't notice me slipping the sheets he had used to bind me to the bed. He hadn't expected that. The knife I'd snatched from the side of his leg when he got down in my face had helped too. He hadn't expected that either.{&1310}\par "That's three times you owe me now," I gloated aloud to Ev as I hopped over the unconscious man toward her bunk again - this time, armed with a gun and a real-life combat knife. Too bad she was still half-dead and knocked out herself and all. It meant I didn't have anyone to see that diabolically clever escape of mine. It almost made the whole thing not worth it.{&1310}\par Oh well. I did have another idea.{&1310}\par A couple minutes later, and I was standing inside the Eluvian man's ship.{&1310}\par He'd moved it since landing last, and it took me most of that time to find it first since you could barely see it through the trees. On the inside, it was much nicer than my busted-up shuttle. A little dirty, and disorganized - but much more hardware. All the consoles seemed to be working too, so that was a start. I skipped over to what I thought was the helm and took a seat.{&1310}\par It took another minute or so, but I got into his on-board computer. Encrypted - of course - but nothing so fancy as the heavy-duty stuff they liked to keep the Riftwatch mainframe and archives locked down with. I took another minute for a bit of personal sight-seeing around his ship's files and functions until I got a better idea of what I was working with. Or, maybe it was a little longer than that.{&1310}\par "Hmm, just look at this ..."{&1310}\par I got hung up somewhere in the system information for a little while. I don't know how long. But I found out that the ship was military. Ex-military anyways. Eluvian make and model, and not too old. Good enough for me, I'd say.{&1310}\par And ... Ev. Right.{&1310}\par Another couple minutes after finally tearing myself away from the ship some super-heavy classified mission dossiet database I couldn't crack too fast, and I was dragging the other woman's dead weight inside. I found a bunk on board to lay her down in. There was only one, though, so when I got around to hauling the Eluvian inside too I ended up just stuffing him in a gear closet that was mostly empty and taking his gun away. It wasn't like he had any good reason to complain about it.{&1310}\par Weird, though. I'd have thought he'd be too heavy for me, but I surprised myself for not the first time since crashing on that planet. And it did finally occur to me then that the gravity here was real. Less than they generated on Riftwatch too. I guess I was lucky I didn't get a heavier planet but, really, it was a little disappointing to realize that it hadn't all been me.{&1310}\par The controls for the ship weren't too hard to figure out once I got the hang of the systems. It maybe took me twenty minutes to get the gist. And I didn't do any more digging in the man's files, as much as I would have loved to. No. Ev needed real help. And she needed it fast.{&1310}\par By the time the first pounding came from that gear locker, I had already gotten the ship up off the ground.{&1310}\par Everything was awhirl - thrusters thrusting, vents venting, and engines ... well, working anyways. A few hasty commands and we were lifting up off the ground towards the tops of the trees. I even got the ship to crest them and its wings unfolded back out before that pounding suddenly took a turn for the worse. The gear locker door burst right open, and a rather incensed Eluvian toppled out onto the floor.{&1310}\par There was some red, warning light flashing on the helm. I never got a chance to figure out what \i that\i0  was supposed to be ... because I was very abruptly face to metal plate with it as the Eluvian rushed me from behind and slapped my skull down into the console. Strangely, that didn't give me a better look. Especially when I bounced back up, clutching my forehead.{&1310}\par "That was the stupidest thing you could have done," was all the man said, spitting it in my ear as I winced against the fourth lump quickly swelling on my head. I was well off to starting a collection.{&1310}\par But he was right. Maybe I should have tied him up too.{&1310}\par "I could've shot you," I gasped at him through my teeth, moving my hands to where he had a fistful of hair at the back of my head in his fist. It felt like he was trying to tear all of it right out. "That would have been worse."{&1310}\par "Only if you missed."{&1310}\par He twisted me around and up out of the chair and slammed me face first again - this time, into the bulkhead. And he kept me squashed there up against the metal while he fidgeted with the controls with his free hand. Too bad he forgot about the gun I had stolen back. I slipped my hand down in my pocket while he frowned at the readout.{&1310}\par "Bad timing," he breathed aloud to someone else.{&1310}\par I swung the gun out and around my chest.{&1310}\par He must have seen it coming out of the corner of his eye, because he swung me around too - right into the helm again. It went right into my gut as I folded neatly over the metal. He reeled me back in the next moment and a hand snaked in for my wrist. I threw my other arm in his way, though. They got tangled up in a haphazard fight for long enough for me to stumble back and get just as tangled in his legs. We both went down.{&1310}\par That red flashing from the console was insistent now. Not that I cared much just then. He got me in some kind of hold while I flopped around as wildly as I could, then snapped in my ear.{&1310}\par "Get the hell off me!"{&1310}\par Not that I was much good for that even had I wanted to. We got so mixed up I didn't know whose limbs were whose anymore. The gun slipped away across the deck, which started to tip. That just carried it even further from both of us. I thought about the knife, briefly, as he got his hand around my mouth. I opened up and tried to bite at him.{&1310}\par Warning sirens went off everywhere, lighting up the dim cabin. A split second later, and the whole thing just upended on us.{&1310}\par Everything shook. Somehow, I got free of the Eluvian and was rolling away until I smacked another bulkhead. The ship rattled wildly again, feeling like it was about to come apart. I might have cried out, but it was hard to tell.{&1310}\par Weird. These things were getting redundant.{&1310}\par Something had hit us. I figured out that much despite the world coming apart again around me. I had no idea what, though. But the Eluvian man must have. I saw him clamber back to his knees and punch a few quick commands into the console. The ship right itself abruptly, wobbling, and spun around.{&1310}\par Two other ships came into sight then out the main viewing port at the front of the cabin. We were a hundred meters above the trees or so, and that was the first thing I noticed - that forest stretching away to the horizon like it never ended. My mouth hung open a bit at that. Too bad it was interrupted by those two ships swooping around and getting bigger and bigger as they flew right toward us. And started firing.{&1310}\par Huge bolts of fire that made my pistol look like it was throwing off sparks flashed toward us. The Eluvian man got a handle on it this time, though, the ship swinging almost sideways to avoid that fire and knocking me sideways into the wall again. But it was sluggish, and still rattling dangerously. One of those bolts clipped us.{&1310}\par It felt and sounded like the whole underside of the ship was ground apart and ripped away. I was already on the floor, but it knocked me flat like it had just dropped out. The Eluvian kept his chair - just barely. His hands scrambled across the board again and before those ships were on us, he had loosed some return fire of his own.{&1310}\par One ship was hit dead-on and burst into a brilliant blaze that dove down into the trees. The other, he only glanced, but it was enough to send it scurrying away back toward the clouds a few seconds later, belching smoke.{&1310}\par I found the gun. Our own ship was still tilted to one side, and not in a good way. It drifted around while the man worked desperately at those controls. Nothing seemed to get any better, no matter what he did. At one point, he barked back over his shoulder at me in a rage.{&1310}\par "Do you have any idea what you just did?"{&1310}\par He didn't wait for me to answer before launching back into the helm with another frantic attack again. But I did.{&1310}\par "I'm starting to."{&1310}\par And I was. As I watched the tops of the trees steadily rising faster and faster to meet us as we dropped right out of the sky.\cf2 {&1310}\par }{&1310}

But I found out that the ship was military. Ex-military anyways. Eluvian make and model, and not too old. Good enough for me, I'd say.{&1310}\par I remembered Ev.{&1310}\par Another couple minutes after tearing myself away from the ship's database and I was dragging Ev's dead weight inside. I found a sturdier bunk on board to lay her down in. There was only one, though, so when I got around to hauling the Eluvian inside too I ended up just stuffing him in a gear closet that was mostly empty and took his gun.{&1310}\par Weird, I thought after I finished with the man. I'd have thought he'd be too heavy for me, but I surprised myself for not the first time since crashing on that planet. And it did occur to me then that the gravity here would be real. Probably even less than they generated on Riftwatch. I guess I was lucky I didn't get a heavier planet. And it was a damn shame I didn't realize it earlier. I could have had some fun seeing how high I could jump and stuff.{&1310}\par The controls for the ship weren't too hard to figure out once I got the hang of the systems. I didn't do any more digging in the man's files, as much as I would have loved to. No. Ev needed real help. And she needed it fast.{&1310}\par By the time the first pounding came from that gear locker, I had already gotten the ship up off the ground.{&1310}\par Everything was awhirl - thrusters thrusting, vents venting, and engines ... well, working. A few hastily thought out commands and we were lifting up off the ground towards the tops of the trees. I even got the ship to crest them and its wings unfolded back out before that pounding suddenly took a turn for the worse. That gear locker door burst right open, and startled the giddy laughter right out of my throat.{&1310}\par There was some red, warning light flashing on the helm. I never got a chance to figure out what \i that\i0  was supposed to be ... because I was very abruptly face to metal plate with it as the Eluvian rushed me from behind and slapped my skull down into the console. Ironically, that didn't give me a better look. Especially when I bounced back up, clutching my forehead.{&1310}\par "That was the stupidest thing you could have done," was all the man said, spitting it in my ear as I winced against the fourth lump quickly swelling on my head. I was well off to starting a collection.{&1310}\par But he was right. It seemed so stupid now. I should have tied him up.{&1310}\par "I could have shot you," I gasped at him through my teeth even so, moving my hands to where he had a fistful of hair at the back of my head in his fist. It felt like he was trying to tear all of it right out. "That would have been worse."{&1310}\par "Only if you missed."{&1310}\par He twisted me around and slammed me face first again - this time, into the bulkhead. And he kept me squashed there up against the metal while he fidgeted with the controls with his free hand. Too bad he forgot about the gun I had stolen back. I slipped my hand down in my pocket while he frowned at the readout.{&1310}\par "Bad timing," he breathed aloud to someone else.{&1310}\par I swung the gun out and around my chest.{&1310}\par He must have seen it coming out of the corner of his eye, because he swung me around too - right into the helm again. It went right into my gut as I folded neatly over the metal. He reeled me back in the next moment and a hand snaked in for my wrist. I threw my other arm in his way, though. They got tangled up in a haphazard fight for long enough for me to stumble back and get just as tangled in his legs. We both went down.{&1310}\par That red flashing from the console was insistent now. Not that I cared much just then. He got me in some kind of hold while I flopped around as wildly as I could, then snapped in my ear.{&1310}\par "Get the hell off me!"{&1310}\par Not that I was much good for that even had I wanted to. We got so mixed up I didn't know whose limbs were whose anymore. The gun slipped away across the deck, which started to tip. That just carried it even further from both of us. I thought about the knife, briefly, as he got his hand around my mouth. I opened up and tried to bite at him.{&1310}\par Warning sirens went off everywhere, lighting up the dim cabin. A split second later, and the whole thing just upended on us.{&1310}\par Everything shook. Somehow, I got free of the Eluvian and was rolling away until I smacked another bulkhead. The ship rattled wildly again, feeling like it was about to come apart. I might have cried out, but it was hard to tell.{&1310}\par These things were getting redundant.{&1310}\par Something had hit us. I figured out that much despite the world coming apart again around me. I had no idea what, though. But the Eluvian man must have. I saw him clamber back to his knees and punch a few quick commands into the console. The ship right itself abruptly, wobbling, and spun around.{&1310}\par Two other ships came into sight then out the main viewing port at the front of the cabin. We were a hundred meters above the trees or so, and that was the first thing I noticed - that forest stretching away to the horizon like it never ended. My mouth hung open a bit at that. Too bad it was interrupted by those two ships swooping around and getting bigger and bigger as they flew right toward us. And started firing.{&1310}\par Huge bolts of fire that made my pistol look like it was throwing off sparks flashed toward us. The Eluvian man got a handle on it this time, though, the ship swinging almost sideways to avoid that fire and knocking me sideways into the wall again. But it was sluggish, and still rattling dangerously. One of those bolts clipped us.{&1310}\par It felt and sounded like the whole underside of the ship was ground apart and ripped away. I was already on the floor, but it knocked me flat like it had just dropped out. The Eluvian kept his chair - just barely. His hands scrambled across the board again and before those ships were on us, he had loosed some return fire of his own.{&1310}\par One ship was hit dead-on and burst into a brilliant blaze that dove down into the trees. The other, he only glanced, but it was enough to send it scurrying away back toward the clouds a few seconds later, belching smoke.{&1310}\par I found the gun. Our own ship was still tilted to one side, and not in a good way. It drifted around while the man worked desperately at those controls. Nothing seemed to get any better, no matter what he did. At one point, he barked back over his shoulder at me in a rage.{&1310}\par "You \i stupid \i0 little girl, do you have any idea what you just did?"{&1310}\par He didn't wait for me to answer before launching back into the helm with another frantic attack again. But I did.{&1310}\par "I'm starting to."{&1310}\par And I was. As I watched the tops of the trees steadily rising faster and faster to meet us as we dropped right out of the sky.\cf2 {&1310}\par }{&1310}

He was out cold alright. I snatched back my - I mean Ev's - gun. And I pistol-whipped him across the face just like you saw in the vids. You know ... just in case.{&1310}\par I had gotten lucky when he didn't notice me slipping the sheets he had used to bind me to the bed. He hadn't expected that. The knife I'd snatched from the side of his leg when he got down in my face had helped too. He hadn't expected that either.{&1310}\par "That's three times you owe me now," I gloated aloud to Ev as I hopped over the unconscious man toward her bunk again - this time, armed with a gun and a real-life combat knife. Too bad she was still half-dead and knocked out herself and all. It meant I didn't have anyone to see that diabolically clever escape of mine. It almost made the whole thing not worth it.{&1310}\par Oh well. I did have another idea.{&1310}\par A minute later, and I was standing inside the Eluvian man's ship.{&1310}\par He'd moved it since landing last, and it took me half that minute to find it first. On the inside, it was much nicer than my busted-up shuttle. A little dirty, and disorganized - but much more hardware. All the consoles seemed to be working too, so that was a start. I skipped over to what I thought was the helm and took a seat.{&1310}\par It took another minute or so, but I got into his on-board computer. Encrypted - of course - but nothing so fancy as the heavy-duty stuff they liked to keep the Riftwatch mainframe and archives locked down with. I took another minute for a bit of personal sight-seeing around his ship's files and functions until I got a better idea of what I was working with. Or, maybe it was a little longer than that.{&1310}\par "Hmm, just look at this ..."{&1310}\par I got hung up somewhere in the system information for a little while. I don't know how long. But I found out that the ship was military. Ex-military anyways. Eluvian make and model, and not too old. Good enough for me, I'd say.{&1310}\par And ... Ev. Right.{&1310}\par Another couple minutes after finally tearing myself away from the ship some super-heavy classified mission dossiet database I couldn't crack too fast, and I was dragging the other woman's dead weight inside. I found a bunk on board to lay her down in. There was only one, though, so when I got around to hauling the Eluvian inside too I ended up just stuffing him in a gear closet that was mostly empty and taking his gun away. It wasn't like he had any good reason to complain about it.{&1310}\par Weird, though. I'd have thought he'd be too heavy for me, but I surprised myself for not the first time since crashing on that planet. And it did finally occur to me then that the gravity here was real. Less than they generated on Riftwatch too.

It maybe took me twenty minutes to get the gist. And I didn't do any more digging in the man's files, as much as I would have loved to. No. Ev needed real help.
