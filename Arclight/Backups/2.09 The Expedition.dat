I'd say it was getting redundant, but ... Well. I still wasn't missing all those years cooped up in Riftwatch just yet.{&1310}\par That Eluvian man was already up when I came back around. A few busted panels sparked in my face as I slowly lifted my head up from the floor. Those boots stalking around behind me seemed much more concerned with that then me lying half-comatose there on the deck. Funny. I thought I might have thrown enough wrenches in his plans so far to make him worry just a little.{&1310}\par He noticed me coming around then. I knew that because he abruptly stomped over, crouched down, and snatched my head up by the hair hard enough to break it right off.{&1310}\par "Where you \i trying\i0  to destroy my ship and strand me here?" he snarled in my ear. I winced as he tugged even tighter.{&1310}\par I guess I spoke too soon.{&1310}\par "I don't know," I gasped out. "Did it work?"{&1310}\par He slammed my head back down into the metal floor.{&1310}\par I lost a minute, wincing there and just catching my breath. He was still moving around the cabin when I came back. I blinked a few times, and noticed he was scrounging up a bunch of things into a bag from compartments and lockers and the floor and stuff. I watched him for a bit before noticing my gun tucked underneath one of the consoles too.{&1310}\par Ev was still out. Go figure. But she had tumbled out of the bunk I left her in and was on her face on the floor toward the back of the ship. The Eluvian man headed that way, stepping over them both. He only spared the wounded, comatose woman a look while he pounded a fist into the release. It creaked and groaned, but started to open. Eventually, he turned to leave.{&1310}\par "Where do you think you're going?"{&1310}\par He glanced back at me without a word. No concern either. Not until he saw the gun in my hand.{&1310}\par He just stared at me for a minute. Still, nothing.{&1310}\par "I said - where do you think you're going?" I lifted the thing up and pointed it right at him for emphasis.{&1310}\par After a few seconds, he turned around. Those eyes never left mine, though. Not a trace of fear that I could tell. Or maybe he was really just that good. Either way, the pistol wasn't so steady in my hands as I'd hoped.{&1310}\par "You didn't shoot me before," he said simply, unworried. "You won't shoot me now."{&1310}\par I tried to stab the thing a little more forcefully in his direction to make him believe I was serious. But I had a hard enough time convincing myself. And, eventually, he started to turn back away. It was a surprise to us both when the thing finally went off in a bright flash.{&1310}\par A bolt glanced the rear hatch, wide over one shoulder. Not that it mattered. The Eluvian's reflexes were so quick, he was bent double in a crouch like he had been standing that way all along. I don't know if I could have even hit him had I tried.{&1310}\par He was on me in the next second, though. I didn't even have time to get off another shot - not that I would have at that point. I was spent. And he just flew at me over Ev on the floor. By the time I flinched, he had already knocked the gun right out of the my hand and had me pressed up against a locker with his forearm crushing my neck.{&1310}\par "The next time you point a gun at me," he seethed down at me through clenched teeth, "You had better not miss." He put a bunch of that extra weight into making that as clear as he could. Really, I think it was a bit of overkill at that point.{&1310}\par I managed to wedge a hand or two in between my throat and his arm. Enough for me to gasp in a few breaths at least. I'm sure he had fun letting me get that little inch.{&1310}\par "You do think there'll be a next time, though."{&1310}\par I spat out in a rush. He kept up the glare for a moment more, and then abruptly twisted away with an irritated grunt. I collapsed down to the broken deck in a heap, gasping in as much of that sickly, sweet air as I could manage. And I had to fight back the urge to puke right there.{&1310}\par The Eluvian man was already back at the hatch and leaving.{&1310}\par "Please," I gasped again, flopping over to look up at him from the floor. "Please, don't leave us here!"{&1310}\par He stopped at the threshold.{&1310}\par Maybe I could get through to him, maybe not. But it didn't take Ev's corpse-like sprawl on the deck in front of me to know I had to try.\cf2\f2 {&1310}\par }{&1310}
