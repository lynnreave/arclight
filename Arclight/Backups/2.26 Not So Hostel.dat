Eventually, he opened his mouth.{&1310}\par "You two take the bed."{&1310}\par That was it.{&1310}\par I was about to say something, but somehow he'd washed himself up. At least, his tattooed face didn't look quite so grimy anymore. Cleaned his teeth too, by the smell of his breath when we pushed past each other. Or lack thereof. I thought about doing so too, washing my dry tongue over their unsettling, filmy taste, but the bed still felt too good.{&1310}\par The thought of a real toilet was enough to get me back up pretty quick, though. I hadn't gone in what must have been days.{&1310}\par When I was done, Jules was collapsed on a chair, looking like a corpse. Ev was burning holes in the floor, slumped in on herself at the edge of the bed.{&1310}\par "Hey," I stabbed a finger at the Eluvian. "Is that real wood?"{&1310}\par He jerked back awake when i went to go take a closer look at it. Wow. And I couldn't believe they made furniture out of that stuff. Trees. Go figure.{&1310}\par "Sorry," I said when I noticed the look on Jules' face. More for causing him to thrash enough to nearly break that thing. "What do we do now?"{&1310}\par "Leave me alone," he said. "That's what you do now."{&1310}\par "No, seriously."{&1310}\par 'Go eat. Sleep. Play with your friend. Just get \i out\i0  of my face for a few hours."{&1310}\par "Well, what about the spaceport?"{&1310}\par "You heard the old man. We can take a train in the morning. Now \i go\i0 ."{&1310}\par "Okay. Fine. Jeez ..."{&1310}\par I left him alone to stew and sleep in his corner after that. I got Ev up and we changed out of our bloody clothes into whatever Ic ould find in our packs. The whole time and she still hadn't said a word.{&1310}\par I got us some food fromt he guy downstairs. Nothing that looked too great - some local animal's meat, he said, and indigenous plants. No imports, was his snide comment when I asked about something else. When I came back, Ev was crying in the toilet.{&1310}\par {&1310}\par "He's gone ..."{&1310}\par "It's okay," I tried to tell her, but she wasn't having any of it. "It's okay-"{&1310}\par "No! It's not!" she broke in forcefully, her voice cracking under the pressure of it. "It's my fault," she said. "It's because of \i me\i0 ."{&1310}\par I tried to calm her down some more, but she was still way too broken up over it. I got it. Really, I did. But I'd never had any parents. Just Bertram. So I guess it was hard to know for sure just how broken up she was inside. And that was what scared me the most - that she might just give up and fall apart into little pieces all around me.{&1310}\par "Stay with me, Ev," I found myself murmuring into her shoulder as she sat there and cried. "Don't leave me all alone here." On that moon with an ex-military, Eluvian psychopath and monsters in the woods. "Just ... stay with me ..."{&1310}\par {&1310}\par It was the most life I'd seen out of her since leaving home and I spent the next half an hour trying to coax even more. But she spent most of it repeating variations of "This isn't real" and demanding I tell her where her dad was. At one point, she even asked me for her gun back.{&1310}\par "Uhhh, I don't think that's such a good idea right now."{&1310}\par "Where is it, Tess? Give it back to me."{&1310}\par I had to wrestle her a bit to keep her from doing god-knows-what she was going to do with that gun. Not an easy thing, since I knew she could kick my ass if she really wanted to. Jules appeared in the doorway whne we got too loud, though, and helped me put her down. She gave up eventually, and we put her to bed.{&1310}\par I might have had a hard time sleeping - what with all the bullshit and getting run around some forest for a couple days straight - but I was just too tired. I managed to stuff my face for a bit and then just about passed out, face-down next to Ev. Neither of us had bothered even get undressed.{&1310}\par And when I woke back up the next morning, Jules was gone.\cf2\f2 {&1310}\par }{&1310}
