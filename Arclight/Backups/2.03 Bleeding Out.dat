Utterly ... alone.{&1310}\par Tess remembered thinking that. As she pulled Evelyn away from the blood-drenched body that used to be her father. The second life pod was as lifeless and painted red as the first, except this one had one dead old man and his as-good-as-dead daughter in it. Tess had popped it open too, and screamed at the sight.{&1310}\par "EV!"{&1310}\par She shrieked like the desperate and deranged while she hauled that almost lifeless body over and out. She turned into clumsy, shaking hands and nervous fits, clawing at the blood-soaked edges of her best and only friend. Eventually, she got her out. Eventually, she hauled that listless corpse over and collapsed down underneath it.{&1310}\par "NO, EVELYN!" she kept up wiht that shriek.{&1310}\par Both hands caught the other woman's arms.{&1310}\par Nolan's dead.{&1310}\par She started kicking back wildly to drag them both away from that grave.{&1310}\par Nolan's dead.{&1310}\par And only made it a couple, broken steps before she tripped over again.{&1310}\par Nolan's DEAD!{&1310}\par "EVELYN!"{&1310}\par She clawed her way up at the other woman, pounding at her pale, lifeless face. She slapped bare skin, screamed in her ears, and beat her about the chest and shoulders with a violent, desperate fury. It was a one-sided fight. {&1310}\par But, eventually, she won.{&1310}\par Evelyn spat up blood in her face, choking and gasping back to life. Her face got no color, but her black eyes flashed open. And she was breathing.{&1310}\par Too bad things didn't get much better after that.{&1310}\par Tess got the other woman back into the world of the living, but she was dead-set against staying there. There was a hole in her - somewhere. Blood soaked her stomach and it wasn't all Nolan's. She lay there, staring, like a breathing corpse. She wouldn't move no matter what Tess did. So she had to drag her best friend all the way back to the shuttle.{&1310}\par The other woman was nearly gone again by the time they got to the wreck, eyes half-lidded and twitching while drops of blood trailed all the way back to her pod. Tess barely made it herself, collapsing against the burnt hull. She couldn't feel her arms anymore by then, but her friend started dying on her again. In a blind panic, Tess almost didn't see the  emergency med kit as she tore apart the cabin with what little she had left. And then, she hardly knew what to do with the gaping wound belching up blood at her from inside Evelyn's side.{&1310}\par "Uh ..."{&1310}\par Tess fumbled with some instructions inside the thing while the other woman bled out, fingers smearing more blood all over. Thank a god it had pictures.{&1310}\par She pulled out a bottle and a roll of gauze, then practically threw the bottle out of her shaking hand trying to rinse that ripped up hole. Clear liquid spilled all over the dying woman's bared stomach. And she abruptly woke up to scream out into Tess's face.{&1310}\par She panicked again. Clean gauze went everywhere. Some even got around that wound. And Evelyn collapsed down again - out.{&1310}\par Blood quickly started seeping through the first round of bandages, and Tess panicked for a third time. Or maybe it was just one long round of panicking that never really ended. Either way, she pushed Evelyn up and started wrapping her with everything she had left in the med kit. By the time she was done, the other woman looked like a mummy from hip to rib, and she could barely see the red spot anymore.{&1310}\par It took a few more minutes of checking and waiting before Evelyn's breathing evened out a bit. It was still weak and quick, and so was her heartbeat, but the bleeding seemed to stop. Tess put a hand to that cold, sweaty forehead, and thought she looked just a little better than before. It was only then that she finally fell back against the side of the shuttle and breathed out herself.{&1310}\par "Hey," she gasped out an exhausted laugh at her friend's comatose form there on the ground. "I just saved your life."{&1310}\par She laughed some more at the thought of it. Sitting there. Sprawled out and worn out beside her near-dead friend. Lost on some backwards planet only gods knew where so far from home. Nolan was dead - stuffed in and bled out in that life pod. Her shuttle was wrecked. And they were alone.{&1310}\par She wasn't laughing by the end of that.{&1310}\par }{&1310}
