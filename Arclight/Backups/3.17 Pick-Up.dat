I tried to grab her arm back, but she pushed me away with a strength that I couldn't have mustered just then for the life of me. My head was spinning with flashes of that firebolt blasting away pieces of her as she crept them slowly out into view. My body started shaking on its own while I stood there helpless and hiding in the dark, just thinking about it.{&1310}\par "Get help," she mouthed at me before she was fully out in view of those agents. I just kept staring at her, frozen stiff. I couldn't decide what to do. I felt like I had to do something. I couldn't just let her go out there. I had to \i do\i0  something.

I don't know what I planned to do with them, but I grabbed both in either hand and stared at them for a long time without really doing anything. I felt time slipping away, but it was hard to focus enough to grab it. So I forced my hand to grab one of those coats too. I slipped it on, and it was a little big. The sleeves were long and covered most of my hands, which was good. It was almost hard to see those pistols in them.{&1310}\par I grabbed my pack out of the corner, and I grabbed Tess'.
