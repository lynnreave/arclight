Quickly. Quietly. No parting farewells from those they had known and grown old with for twenty years. No final words to betray them before they even started. Just the way Nolan wanted it. The way it had to be. The girl was not so pleased, though.{&1310}\par It was almost a day before Evelyn regained consciousness. And then it was only enough to wonder groggily aloud again where she was and what had happened. Thaddeus had reminded her broken, burnt body what it was before the attack. And it had taken her mind along with it. She was at a loss for what happened after two men ambushed her in the old maintenance tunnels on Riftwatch.{&1310}\par Nolan was content to leave it that way. The less she knew, the better and more protected she was. It was not like she was not in much of a position to fight with him either, though. And she was still convinced, despite her vague memories of the attack, that the whole affair was just some temporary, long-awaited sabbatical from the station. He was content to leave that the way it was too.{&1310}\par The trip fell into a brief routine of idle questions about his plans and half-lamented whimsy over leaving everyone on Riftwatch behind. Despite her condition, Evelyn continued to chatter excitedly about it all without the faintest idea about what he really meant to do or why. And Nolan buried himself in his thoughts about that very thing, barely leaving the pilot's chair for the entire thirty hours. {&1310}\par He hardly ate and didn't sleep. The girl must have started to suspect by the time they reached the station, even though she had been asleep for most of it. Her excitement abated too quickly, and she turned to studying him when she thought he wasn't paying attention instead. He made a note to himself to hide it better in the coming days.{&1310}\par The Riftway hub changed from a distant, unmoving speck against the black to a floating spire in a matter of hours. And Evelyn could hardly take her eyes off it once it came into view.{&1310}\par "What\i  is \i0 that?" she demanded from the front of the craft with her face all but pressed flat into the porthole. It interrupted his thoughts while he draped himself over the pilot's console, and she had to twist back around to get his attention. He glanced at the distant station, then at her, and finally back down to the console again.{&1310}\par "Our first stop," was all he said. Not that the girl would have left it at that.{&1310}\par "There?" she stabbed a finger eagerly at the station in the porthole. "We're going there?" Her head bobbed incredulously. "We're getting on \i that\i0  there?"{&1310}\par Nolan ignored the question, still pondering a decision. Evelyn was transfixed on the thing, though.{&1310}\par "Are there a lot of people onboard?" she pressed, eyes wide and mouth agape as she stood there wondering at the novelty of it all. {&1310}\par {&1310}\par {&1310}\par "Evelyn."{&1310}\par I jerked back awake.{&1310}\par Something pawed at my wrist. I jolted back awake at the touch.{&1310}\par Fingers on my arm. I snatched back my hand, and twisted that way with a gasp. A little kid hunched down beside me, his face a sickly yellow. He stank, and was mumbling something in a squeaking voice that made my skin crawl. He looked like he had just clawed its way out of the garbage.{&1310}\par I must have been loud, because I felt dad beside me in an instant. He just stood there, but that little boy whipped back around and scampered off without another thought. I glanced up at him, and he down at me. Then he turned back away, face as hard as ever.{&1310}\par "If you want to see Riftwatch before we leave for good," he told me, now over near a porthole in the wall behind, "then you had better come do so now."{&1310}\par I twisted around in surprise, but I wasn't in the access tunnels anymore. It was a big cabin, simple benches and chairs scattered all around. People were everywhere. A few looked like the child I woke up to. Most were quiet. But it was loud in there all the same, and I didn't recognize any of them.{&1310}\par I couldn't remember what happened after the flames in the tunnels. I tried. I guess I had found dad, though, so it didn't matter that much. I had made it. I just had no idea where I had made it to.{&1310}\par "Evelyn."{&1310}\par I pushed myself up at the sound of his voice, harsher this time. He glanced back from the porthole - none of the ones on Riftwatch I had seen were ever that crude and dirty. Except maybe down where nobody really went. I don't know. But dad was waiting there for me.{&1310}\par My body was a little stiff, but that was all. I remembered the two men in the tunnels tossing me around with the Voidtongue. I guess I passed out sometime in the middle of it, and he found me. Somehow. It left me wondering what dad must have done to those two as I hobbled over toward the window. When I got there, he pulled back so I could see.{&1310}\par "There," he pointed. But I didn't need him too. There was only one thing to look at other than the Rift, glimmering and flourescent in the depths of space. The station - Riftwatch ... Home. It was small enough now to fit in that dingy little porthole.{&1310}\par We had left.{&1310}\par We had already left.{&1310}\par No more Warden. No more Watchmen or Elle. No more Bertram or Ressler or even Sergeant Macome.{&1310}\par No more Tess ...{&1310}\par Somehow, I was sitting again. I didn't get to see Riftwatch fade away out of sight. I'm not sure if I cared about that. I had thought there would be goodbyes and a last moment before getting on that shuttle. But, nothing. We were just suddenly here.{&1310}\par Except here wasn't on a shuttle. I looked around again, and that much was obvious. A different ship. Bigger, probably. I glanced back toward dad.{&1310}\par "What happened?" I finally asked.{&1310}\par He didn't take his eyes away from the porthole, staring out into space. And, when he eventually did answer me, I couldn't help but wonder if it was even worth the trouble of me opening my mouth.{&1310}\par "Events that I had not foreseen."{&1310}\par "What?"{&1310}\par Maybe it was my fault. If I wasn't smart enough to figure it out, then he wasn't going to tell me. That was usually the way things went. Just because we weren't in Riftwatch anymore didn't mean everything was going to change.{&1310}\par So I tried something different.{&1310}\par "Where are we?"{&1310}\par The answer this time, was a bit more forthcoming. But not by much.{&1310}\par "On our way to someplace safer."{&1310}\par I eyed the crowd in there again. It \i was \i0 a ship of some sort. Below the main decks, I would guess. Not much safer than Riftwatch, though. I don't know if he really noticed. But that was when \i I\i0  noticed something. A missing something. Precisely, \i three\i0  missing somethings.{&1310}\par My bags! They were gone!{&1310}\par I tore all around me in a frenzy. There was \i noooo\i0  way I had just lost them like that after all the running around on the station. Not after everything I'd been through today. I found the backpack I had been wearing - propped up like a bad pillow on the bench I woke up on - and snagged that lifeline. Dad noticed my frantic searching with a calm eye from where he stood. My eyes flashed up at him in an instant.{&1310}\par "Where are my things?"{&1310}\par "I left the rest behind," he explained, as cool as could be. He wasn't talking about his own stuff being thrown away back on the station. Not that it mattered.{&1310}\par "W\i hat\i0 ?"{&1310}\par "It was too much, Evelyn," he continued in that infuriatingly placid tone. "We have to move quickly." Maybe I was still just a little in shock.{&1310}\par All my things ... \i Gone\i0  ...{&1310}\par And he acted like it was the least important thing in the universe just then. I ... I think I was going to scream at him.{&1310}\par I almost did. I stood up and opened my mouth to. Right there in the middle of that floating refugee camp full of people I didn't know. That was when he rounded on me abruptly, though. The look on his face was so suddenly deadpan that I choked on the sound in my throat instantly.{&1310}\par "What?" I ventured anxiously when he said nothing, just stared back into the room. I twisted my head around to get a good look, but there was nothing more interesting going on there. I was still left wondering why we were down there looking like dirty refugees instead of up on what must have been one of the much nicer decks. Dad was pretty important back on Riftwatch.{&1310}\par He just laid a hand down on my shoulder, though.

I ventured anxiously when he said nothing, just stared back into the room. I twisted my head around to get a good look, but there was nothing more interesting going on there.

Quickly. Quietly. No parting farewells from those they had known and grown old with for twenty years. No final words to betray them before they even started. Just the way Nolan wanted it. The way it had to be. The girl was not so pleased, though.{&1310}\par It was almost a day before Evelyn regained consciousness. And then it was only enough to wonder groggily aloud again where she was and what had happened. Thaddeus had reminded her broken, burnt body what it was before the attack. And it had taken her mind along with it. She was at a loss for what happened after two men ambushed her in the old maintenance tunnels on Riftwatch.{&1310}\par Nolan was content to leave it that way. The less she knew, the better and more protected she was. It was not like she was not in much of a position to fight with him either, though. And she was still convinced, despite her vague memories of the attack, that the whole affair was just some temporary, long-awaited sabbatical from the station. He was content to leave that the way it was too.{&1310}\par The trip fell into a brief routine of idle questions about his plans and half-lamented whimsy over leaving everyone on Riftwatch behind. Despite her condition, Evelyn continued to chatter excitedly about it all without the faintest idea about what he really meant to do or why. And Nolan buried himself in his thoughts about that very thing, barely leaving the pilot's chair for the entire thirty hours. {&1310}\par He hardly ate and didn't sleep. The girl must have started to suspect by the time they reached the station, even though she had been asleep for most of it. Her excitement abated too quickly, and she turned to studying him when she thought he wasn't paying attention instead. He made a note to himself to hide it better in the coming days.{&1310}\par The Riftway hub changed from a distant, unmoving speck against the black to a floating spire in a matter of hours. And Evelyn could hardly take her eyes off it once it came into view.{&1310}\par "What\i  is \i0 that?" she demanded from the front of the craft with her face all but pressed flat into the porthole. It interrupted his thoughts while he draped himself over the pilot's console, and she had to twist back around to get his attention. He glanced at the distant station, then at her, and finally back down to the console again.{&1310}\par "Our first stop," was all he said. Not that the girl would have left it at that.{&1310}\par "There?" she stabbed a finger eagerly at the station in the porthole. "We're going there?" Her head bobbed incredulously. "We're getting on \i that\i0  there?"{&1310}\par Nolan ignored the question, still pondering a decision. Evelyn was transfixed on the thing, though.{&1310}\par "Are there a lot of people onboard?" she pressed, eyes wide and mouth agape as she stood there wondering at the novelty of it all. {&1310}\par {&1310}\par {&1310}\par "Evelyn."{&1310}\par I jerked back awake.{&1310}\par Something pawed at my wrist. I jolted back awake at the touch.{&1310}\par Fingers on my arm. I snatched back my hand, and twisted that way with a gasp. A little kid hunched down beside me, his face a sickly yellow. He stank, and was mumbling something in a squeaking voice that made my skin crawl. He looked like he had just clawed its way out of the garbage.{&1310}\par I must have been loud, because I felt dad beside me in an instant. He just stood there, but that little boy whipped back around and scampered off without another thought. I glanced up at him, and he down at me. Then he turned back away, face as hard as ever.{&1310}\par "If you want to see Riftwatch before we leave for good," he told me, now over near a porthole in the wall behind, "then you had better come do so now."{&1310}\par I twisted around in surprise, but I wasn't in the access tunnels anymore. It was a big cabin, simple benches and chairs scattered all around. People were everywhere. A few looked like the child I woke up to. Most were quiet. But it was loud in there all the same, and I didn't recognize any of them.{&1310}\par I couldn't remember what happened after the flames in the tunnels. I tried. I guess I had found dad, though, so it didn't matter that much. I had made it. I just had no idea where I had made it to.{&1310}\par "Evelyn."{&1310}\par I pushed myself up at the sound of his voice, harsher this time. He glanced back from the porthole - none of the ones on Riftwatch I had seen were ever that crude and dirty. Except maybe down where nobody really went. I don't know. But dad was waiting there for me.{&1310}\par My body was a little stiff, but that was all. I remembered the two men in the tunnels tossing me around with the Voidtongue. I guess I passed out sometime in the middle of it, and he found me. Somehow. It left me wondering what dad must have done to those two as I hobbled over toward the window. When I got there, he pulled back so I could see.{&1310}\par "There," he pointed. But I didn't need him too. There was only one thing to look at other than the Rift, glimmering and flourescent in the depths of space. The station - Riftwatch ... Home. It was small enough now to fit in that dingy little porthole.{&1310}\par We had left.{&1310}\par We had already left.{&1310}\par No more Warden. No more Watchmen or Elle. No more Bertram or Ressler or even Sergeant Macome.{&1310}\par No more Tess ...{&1310}\par Somehow, I was sitting again. I didn't get to see Riftwatch fade away out of sight. I'm not sure if I cared about that. I had thought there would be goodbyes and a last moment before getting on that shuttle. But, nothing. We were just suddenly here.{&1310}\par Except here wasn't on a shuttle. I looked around again, and that much was obvious. A different ship. Bigger, probably. I glanced back toward dad.{&1310}\par "What happened?" I finally asked.{&1310}\par He didn't take his eyes away from the porthole, staring out into space. And, when he eventually did answer me, I couldn't help but wonder if it was even worth the trouble of me opening my mouth.{&1310}\par "Events that I had not foreseen."{&1310}\par "What?"{&1310}\par Maybe it was my fault. If I wasn't smart enough to figure it out, then he wasn't going to tell me. That was usually the way things went.
