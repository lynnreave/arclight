Thank a god for small favors.{&1310}\par My feet hurt. My legs hurt. My whole body hurt. So I just lay there, face-down in the dirt, breathing hard and not daring to stir a single other muscle. I didn't know where we were. I didn't even care to look. I just lay there. That was enough.{&1310}\par Jules kept moving around. A little stiff in his step, but worlds apart from me after all that hiking through this wilderness. If not for me, he might have kept going on through the night. If not for Ev, he might have gone on forever. Instead, he just stuck around with us humans for a bit.{&1310}\par I didn't even realize I had fallen asleep again until I smelled something rich and smoky in the air. It got me blinking up in surprise to find Jules resting on his haunches across a bunch of burning branches from me, the whole mess tossed into the dirt and spitting out smoke. Inches from my face.{&1310}\par Well, maybe not that close. But it was close enough to get me moving again. I scrambled wildly back in a rush, kicking dirt up with my hands. It sprayed into the fire, and the flames spat back.{&1310}\par "Careful!" Jules abruptly snapped, as I skidded back on the seat of my pants. "You'll put it out."{&1310}\par I just stared at him. Wide-eyed.{&1310}\par "Put it out!" I all but screeched at him. "What the hell are you doing? Trying to kill me?" Every time I thought to take an eye off him he tried to pull something new. And I was too tired for that shit anymore.{&1310}\par I hit the stony bluff of a steep hillside, bringing my hasty retreat to a halt. He just stabbed a finger at me over those flames between us, undaunted or caring.{&1310}\par "Keep your voice down," he warned with a dangerous look in his eye. "And calm down. We aren't on any station right now."{&1310}\par I stared at that fire, and I stared at him. He just poked it absently with a long stick, stirring the flames. He didn't look like he really cared at all if that stuff got loose and started burning us all. To be fair, though, I guess there were a lot less bulkheads out there. And a lot more air.{&1310}\par I looked around for Ev, and she was lying peacefully next to the fire on her back. Her chest rose and fell evenly, and her skin wasn't so milky anymore. She really did look a bit better, I had to say.{&1310}\par Eventually, I even scooted back a little toward the man's fire. It was cold out there at night.{&1310}\par "So." {&1310}\par I cleared my throat after a few awkward minutes trying to decide if it wouldn't be better to just pass out like I had last night. It sounded really, really good just then. But there was no way I was going to make it another day like that. Not without an answer or two first.{&1310}\par "Why did you, uh ... why did you come back for us?"{&1310}\par It wasn't like I was complaining. Not really. But it just seemed weird to take off like he had only to come flying back out of nowhere to save the day. But, for all I knew, he was running me through that torture just for the hell of it. Maybe he really had nothing better to do than get back at me for crashing his ship.{&1310}\par He ignored me more for another minute, though. Until I made another irritating noise in his direction.{&1310}\par "Well?"{&1310}\par "Does it matter?"{&1310}\par He gave me one of those flinty-eyed, hard-edged looks I had started getting used to whenever I opened my mouth at him out of turn. Which was every time. And whenever I was lucid on our death march - enough to pay him any attention - I just got this really strong feeling that he would have rather me or him be anywhere else. I suppose I couldn't blame him. But it did make it hard not to wonder why he was even bothering in the first place.{&1310}\par "I guess not," I muttered back at him. And kept on calling him a few colorful things I'd learned from Bertram under my breath. He just glanced up at me again.{&1310}\par "I can hear you, you know."{&1310}\par "So what?" I blinked up at him. "You \i are\i0 ."{&1310}\par His lips twisted a bit into something other than a smile. Just for a moment. He kept poking at the fire.{&1310}\par "Tell me why you were lost out here in the first place," he demanded quietly then. Unlike me, he didn't bother to make it a question.{&1310}\par "Why should I?"{&1310}\par He cocked an eyebrow at me. "I could leave you out here just as easily as back at my ship. It doesn't make any difference to me."{&1310}\par I laughed, and shook my head. "No you couldn't." He had said that before and still come back.{&1310}\par "You want to try me again?" was all he asked. And I clamped shut at the grim look on his stony face.{&1310}\par "Uh ... no."{&1310}\par Another awkward moment or two passed - me, just sitting there playing with my hands. I looked to Ev again, and so did he. Then he looked at me.{&1310}\par "Well?"{&1310}\par I shrugged. {&1310}\par "I told you when you first landed," I grumbled back. "Right before you hit me in the face with your gun."{&1310}\par And he just grunted.{&1310}\par "No one could've understood that mess coming out of your mouth."{&1310}\par "Ev could."{&1310}\par "What?"{&1310}\par "Nothing! Fine," I spat at him across the fire. "Just shut up. I told you," I began again, slumping over against my knees with both hands buried back in my hair, "Ev's ship got attacked and her Dad was killed. She jettisoned down here. And I followed her."{&1310}\par "In that shuttle?"{&1310}\par I nodded.{&1310}\par "I kind of borrowed it from her Dad when he was done using it."{&1310}\par "Borrowed it?"{&1310}\par "Well, um," I hedged, "stowed away and took it when they got on the transport ship. Kind of."{&1310}\par He just grunted again.{&1310}\par "I guess I shouldn't be surprised you destroyed my ship as well."{&1310}\par "\i You\i0  were the one flying it."{&1310}\par He leaned back, ignoring me for a minute or so, but staring nonetheless. Trying to read something in my face, or something, I guess. It was a little uncomfortable, and I glanced away. The wind picked up - cold. I twisted around and put my back to the cliffside again, getting as close to that fire as I dared. The Eluvian man didn't move from where he was.{&1310}\par "Those were pirates that attacked us," he said after a little while longer sitting in silence. "They would have followed your beacon like I did. I had planned on being ready for them when they did."{&1310}\par I looked over at him. "Sorry," was the only thing that came to mind, but I wasn't sure if he really deserved it. Or if I meant it. I guess he had kind of saved our lives. I didn't know what else I could really do, though. He attacked us first.{&1310}\par "Your friend is doing better," he remarked with a sideways glance toward Ev.{&1310}\par "Yeah. Thanks," I mumbled back. I probably should have eaten something, but we had nothing left after today unless he was holding out on me, and my stomach felt like a sinkhole. I pawed at some water instead before I came back to him.{&1310}\par "Where are we going?"{&1310}\par "The nearest waypost," he said, as if that should have meant anything to me. "They should have a transit rail to whatever spaceport still exists on this moon." He grabbed a canteen of his own and filled it from the stores in his pack from the ship. It was almost gone too.{&1310}\par "Moon?" I asked.{&1310}\par "Yeah," he admitted, glancing around to the treetops above - black now with the night, and blocking out the stars above. "The daylight doesn't seem short to you? No, it wouldn't, would it."{&1310}\par "Short?" I breathed, aghast. Marching all day, and it hadn't even been a \i full\i0  day?{&1310}\par "Look," he pointed up above, and I followed him. "Stars. We'll be planetward tomorrow. It's a little far off, but you should be able to see it."{&1310}\par I hadn't even noticed those first couple days. Maybe their was something in the clouds, washed away in the sky? It seemed such a shame to miss. People always said the Rift was beautiful to come see, but I wondered what an entire planet would look like up in that sky. Probably a lot more so.{&1310}\par I came back down, opening my mouth to ask how much farther it could have possibly been to get where we were going. I didn't have much left in me, but he couldn't have had so much more either. Right? I never got that far, though. {&1310}\par I turned my head around to look at him again, but something caught my eye instead. My mouth was still open as I froze, staring off that way. And I blinked. There was a black shape against the trees, a dozen meters away outside the firelight.{&1310}\par "What ..." I started, but never finished.{&1310}\par Jules glanced back down at me, instantly following my eyes out into the woods. His hands flew towards his rifle so fast, I didn't even register it until he had the thing up and pointed that way. He twisted something on the barrel, and a beam of light flushed out the dark.{&1310}\par There was a glimpse. Something black, and smooth between ribbed folds. That's all I could see for a second before it stepped back out of the light behind the trees.{&1310}\par I think I screamed.\cf2\f1 {&1310}\par }{&1310}

It sprayed into the fire, and the flames spat back.{&1310}\par "Careful!" Julian abruptly snapped, as I skidded back on the seat of my pants. "You'll put it out."{&1310}\par I just stared at him. Wide-eyed.{&1310}\par "Put it out!" I all but screeched at him. "What the hell are you doing? Trying to kill me?" Every time I thought to take an eye of him he tried to pull something new. And I was too tired for that shit anymore.{&1310}\par I hit the stony bluff of a steep hillside, bringing my hasty retreat to a halt. He just stabbed a finger at me over those flames between us, undaunted or caring.{&1310}\par "Keep your voice down," he warned with a dangerous look in his eye. "And calm down. We aren't on any station right now."{&1310}\par I stared at that fire, and I stared at him. He just poked it absently with a long stick, stirring the flames. He didn't look like he really cared at all if that stuff got loose and started burning us all. To be fair, though, I guess there were a lot less bulkheads out there. And a lot more air.{&1310}\par I looked around for Ev, and she was lying peacefully next to the fire on her back. Her chest rose and fell evenly, and her skin wasn't so milky anymore. She really did look a bit better, I had to say.{&1310}\par Eventually, I even scooted back a little toward the man's fire. It was cold out there at night.{&1310}\par "So." {&1310}\par I cleared my throat after a few awkward minutes trying to decide if it wouldn't be better to just pass out like I had last night. It sounded really, really good just then. But there was no way I was going to make it another day like that. Not without an answer or two first.{&1310}\par "Why did you, uh ... why did you come back for us?"{&1310}\par It wasn't like I was complaining. Not really. But it just seemed weird to take off like he had only to come flying back out of nowhere to save the day. But, for all I knew, he was running me through that torture just for the hell of it. Maybe he really had nothing better to do than get back at me for crashing his ship.{&1310}\par He ignored more for another minute, though. Until I made another irritating noise in his direction.{&1310}\par "Well?"{&1310}\par "Does it matter?"{&1310}\par He gave me one of those flinty-eyed, hard-edged looks I had started getting used to whenever I opened my mouth at him out of turn. Which was every time. And whenever I was lucid on our death march - enough to pay him any attention - I just got this really strong feeling that he would have rather me or him be anywhere else. I suppose I couldn't blame him. But it did make it hard not to wonder why he was even bothering in the first place.{&1310}\par "I guess not," I muttered back at him. And kept on calling him a few colorful things I'd learned from Bertram under my breath. He just glanced up at me again.{&1310}\par "I can hear you, you know."{&1310}\par "So what?" I blinked up at him. "You \i are\i0 ."{&1310}\par His lips twisted a bit into something other than a smile. Just for a moment. He kept poking at the fire.{&1310}\par "Tell me why you were lost out here in the first place," he demanded quietly then. Unlike me, he didn't bother to make it a question.{&1310}\par "Why should I?"{&1310}\par He cocked an eyebrow at me. "I could leave you out here just as easily as back at my ship. It doesn't make any difference to me."{&1310}\par I laughed, and shook my head. "No you couldn't." He had said that before and still come back.{&1310}\par "You want to try me again?" was all he asked. And I clamped shut at the grim look on his stony face.{&1310}\par "Uh ... no."{&1310}\par Another awkward moment or two passed - me, just sitting there playing with my hands. I looked to Ev again, and so did he. Then he looked at me.{&1310}\par "Well?"{&1310}\par I shrugged. {&1310}\par "I told you when you first landed," I grumbled back. "Right before you hit me in the face with your gun."{&1310}\par And he just grunted.{&1310}\par "No one could've understood that mess coming out of your mouth."{&1310}\par "Ev could."{&1310}\par "What?"{&1310}\par "Nothing! Fine!" I spat at him across the fire. "Just shut up. I told you," I began again, slumping over against my knees with both hands buried back in my hair, "Ev's ship got attacked and her dad was killed. She jettisoned down here. And I followed her."{&1310}\par "In that shuttle?"{&1310}\par I nodded.{&1310}\par "I kind of borrowed it from her dad when he was done using it."{&1310}\par "Borrowed it?"{&1310}\par "Well, um," I hedged, "stowed away and took it when they got on the transport ship. Kind of."{&1310}\par He just grunted again.{&1310}\par "I guess I shouldn't be surprised you destroyed my ship as well."{&1310}\par "\i You\i0  were the one flying it!"{&1310}\par He leaned back, ignoring me for a minute or so, but staring nonetheless. Trying to read something in my face, or something, I guess. It was a little uncomfortable, and I glanced away. The wind picked up - cold. I twisted around and put my back to the cliffside again, getting as close to that fire as I dared. The eluvian man didn't move from where he was.{&1310}\par "Those were pirates that attacked us," he said after a little while longer sitting in silence. "They would have followed your beacon like I did. I had planned on being ready for them when they did."{&1310}\par I looked over at him. "Sorry," was the only thing that came to mind, but I wasn't sure if he really deserved it. I guess he had kind of saved our lives. I didn't know what else I could really do, though. He attacked us first.{&1310}\par "Your friend is doing better," he remarked with a sideways glance toward Ev.{&1310}\par "Yeah. Thanks," I mumbled back. I probably should have eaten something, but we had nothing left after today and my stomach felt like a sinkhole. I pawed at some water instead before I came back to him.{&1310}\par "Where are we going?"{&1310}\par "The nearest waypost," he said, as if that should have meant anything to me. "They should have a transit rail to whatever spaceport exists on this pissant, little moon." He grabbed a canteen of his own and filled it from the stores in his pack from the ship. It was almost gone too.{&1310}\par "Moon?" I asked.{&1310}\par "Yeah," he admitted, glancing around to the treetops above - black now with the night, and blocking out the stars above. "The daylight doesn't seem short to you? No, it wouldn't, would it."{&1310}\par "Short?" I breathed, aghast. Marching all day, and it hadn't even been a \i full\i0  day?{&1310}\par "Look," he pointed up above, and I followed him. "Stars. We'll be planetward tomorrow. It's a little far off, but you should be able to see it."{&1310}\par I hadn't even noticed those first couple days. Maybe their was something in the clouds, washed away in the sky? It seemed such a shame to miss. People always said the Rift was beautiful to come see, but I wondered what an entire planet would look like up in that sky. Probably a lot more so.{&1310}\par I came back down, opening my mouth to ask how much farther it could have possibly been to get where we were going. I didn't have much left in me, but he couldn't have had so much more either. Right? I never got that far, though. {&1310}\par I turned my head around to look at him again, but something caught my eye instead. My mouth was still open as I froze, staring off that way. And I blinked. There was a black shape against the trees, a dozen meters away outside the firelight.{&1310}\par "What ..." I started, but never finished.{&1310}\par Julian glanced back down at me, instantly following my eyes out into the woods. His hands flew towards his rifle so fast, I didn't even register it until he had the thing up and pointed that way. He twisted something on the barrel, and a beam of light flushed out the dark.{&1310}\par There was a glimpse. Something black, and smooth between ribbed folds. That's all I could see for a second before it stepped back out of the light behind the trees.{&1310}\par I think I screamed.\cf2\f1 {&1310}\par }{&1310}
