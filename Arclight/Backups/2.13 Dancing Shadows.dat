Whatever it was. As Jules swept over those trees with the light on his rifle.{&1310}\par I froze, that's what I did. My chest heaved as I sat there, unable to move. Between that, and the night and the fire - I broke out in a cold, wide-eyed sweat. The eluvian man took a step forward, crouching low.{&1310}\par Firelight flickered along aroud us. The night grew quiet again but for that cacophony of sounds I had started to get used to. They felt quiet now too, waiting like we were. Nothing moved except Jules. And he barely moved anything but that light on his rifle as he poured over the trees.{&1310}\par Silence. {&1310}\par There was an abrupt scuffling, as I finally remembered that gun in my pocket. I scrambled to pull it out and point it out into the woods too. I had no idea where or at what I should have been pointing, though, so I just kept fidgeting around where Jules wasn't. I backed up toward the cliffside wall again.{&1310}\par Something moved. {&1310}\par I snapped that way.{&1310}\par Nothing there.{&1310}\par I sucked in a breath.{&1310}\par Over there.{&1310}\par I twisted back around.{&1310}\par The trees creaked in the wind, and there a loud clicking sound.{&1310}\par "Jules ...!"{&1310}\par The eluvian man glanced back over his shoulder, almost outside the light of the fire.{&1310}\par "Quiet!"{&1310}\par The air rushed. I couldn't see it until it was already there, but I felt it. And it was on top of Jules before he could even turn back around.{&1310}\par I'd loosed a couple wild shots at him before I could stop myself.{&1310}\par The night lit up. For a few seconds, at least. That light on the rifle flickered wildly all over the place. I couldn't even tell where it was anymore after those few seconds. I heard Jules grunting aloud in the dark beyond the fire, and then he was abruptly gone. Everything went dark and quiet outside that flickering ring of light.{&1310}\par "J-Jules?"{&1310}\par I was trying to wedge myself down into the corner between the ground and the cliffside without realizing, that pistol shaking wildly out in my hands ahead. Nothing moved, and nothing made a sound for a few more seconds. Just me, and my quivering chest rattling out in the dark.{&1310}\par "Jules!"{&1310}\par There was a rustling in the trees a ways out. Not even close, and I stared. A couple flashes of light pierced the night out there - so far away that I blinked, wondering what else could possibly be hiding in the dark with us. Funny how I hardly cared one way or another about that eluvian man until now. When he was the only thing between us and whatever the hell those things were out there.{&1310}\par Someone groaned. It took me a minute, but I realized it was Ev. She stirred there beside the fire. I had almost forgotten about her, and now that made me forget about Jules. I lowered the gun and scrambled over to her side.{&1310}\par Her eyes fluttered open.{&1310}\par "Ev?"{&1310}\par I reached out a shaky hand to the other woman's shoulder. She was awake of a sudden and staring blankly up at the night above with some kind of sickly grimace on her face. Tears were glinting in streams out the sides of her eyes down toward the dirt.{&1310}\par "Ev!"{&1310}\par I didn't think she heard me.{&1310}\par A few more shots went off. Closer this time. My head whipped back toward the trees, but I couldn't see anything. Things got quiet again as soon as I did. I remembered the gun, and thrust it over that way.{&1310}\par I waited.{&1310}\par And waited.{&1310}\par ... and waited.{&1310}\par My ragged breaths and Ev's whispered groans were the only thing I heard for a long time. And, for a long time, nothing moved out in that black wilderness.{&1310}\par Then something came tearing through the brush. Right at me.{&1310}\par I fired. And I kept firing. I kept firing until I saw that eluvian man's face.{&1310}\par Then I stopped.{&1310}\par I stared, for a second, at him bent over there with his hands protecting his head. He had collapsed to one side against the trunk of a tree. As soon as I let up, though, he glanced up at me with a feverish look in his eye. Then he collapsed down into the dirt.{&1310}\par "FUCK!"{&1310}\par I screamed, and fired a few more times into the trees. Nothing took, that I could see. When things settled down quickly after that without a sound, I looked at the eluvian man in the dirt.{&1310}\par "Jules?"{&1310}\par I tried my quaky voice again. But he didn't bother to move on my account.{&1310}\par Oh god. {&1310}\par I'd killed him.{&1310}\par "... Jules!"{&1310}\par This time, it came out as barely more than a squeak.{&1310}\par He suddenly turned his head to one side, and spat out some blood into the dirt.{&1310}\par "Stop," he grunted, and growled, breathing hard, "calling me that."{&1310}\par I just stared at him, wide-eyed - suddenly wanting to laugh. But I couldn't. He started trying to pick himself up from the ground and crawl over my way. After an awkward moment, unsure what to do, I scrambled over to help.{&1310}\par "What the hell was \i that\i0 ?" I all but shrieked in his face when I got a hand on him. I forgot about it as soon as I got a good look at his face and the holes in him, though. It was tricky in the flickering light, but I could see the blood running down from his forehead, soaking his eyebrow, and the stained puncture in his jacket. "Are you all right?" I whispered frantically at him instead.{&1310}\par "I ... I don't know," he struggled with that, and I freaked out a bit more until I realized it was the answer to the first question. He pushed me away in response to the second, and hobbled over toward the fire. "Lucky you aren't any good with that," he mumbled under his breath. "For now."{&1310}\par Jules winced and plopped himself back down next to his pack, and I kept glancing back over toward the woods. "We need to move," he said aloud at me, pulling something out of his things after wrestling, one-handed with it for a few seconds. It looked like one of those needles he had stuck Ev with the other night.{&1310}\par "What? How?" I babbled at him. "You can't even walk!"{&1310}\par He stabbed himself with that needle under his jacket near the hole that had been punched through it, convulsed violently a few times, and then settled back down, stiff as a board. "I'll be fine," he growled then, his voice thin and strained.{&1310}\par "What about Ev!"{&1310}\par He was leaning back against the cliffside at a rigid angle, bloody face turned up and not seeing me as those hard eyes stared away into space. "I'll get her," he said simply. "Grab one of the," he twitched abruptly, wincing againn, "logs from the fire."{&1310}\par "What? I'm not touching that!"{&1310}\par "Do it!" he hissed, eyes squeezing shut. He hefted his rifle awkwardly in one hand, the other pressed tight to the side of his chest with that hole. I don't know if he would have shot me for almost blowing his head off this time, but I dove toward the fire without thinking just the same, and dithered with one of those flaming pieces of wood a few seconds before I got a grip on it.{&1310}\par "Okay ..." I sat there with that flaming stick of wood in one hand, and my wide-eyed, terrified self in the other. "What do I do now?"{&1310}\par He chose that moment to come back to life, pulling himself back up and slowly climbing to his feet. {&1310}\par "Get behind me." {&1310}\par He stumbled over toward Ev, still comatose with her eyes open on the ground. That gave him a second's pause before he bent down to swing her up over one shoulder. {&1310}\par "Keep that ... sidearm ready," he grunted under the raven-haired woman's weight. She almost took him down, but he pushed right through it and had her up again. I just got in around behind him, shaking all over with the gun wobbling in hand. He canted his head.{&1310}\par "This way. Move."{&1310}\par And we started off into that black wood. But I never stopped looking back.\cf2\f1 {&1310}\par }{&1310}

Whatever it was. As Jules swept over those trees with the light on his rifle.{&1310}\par I froze, that's what I did. My chest heaved as I sat there, unable to move. Between that, and the night and the fire - I broke out in a cold, wide-eyed sweat. The Eluvian man took a step forward, crouching low.{&1310}\par Firelight flickered along around us. The night grew quiet again but for that cacophony of sounds I had started to get used to. They felt quiet now too, waiting like we were. Nothing moved except Jules. And he barely moved anything but that light on his rifle as he poured over the trees.{&1310}\par Silence. {&1310}\par There was an abrupt scuffling, as I finally remembered that gun in my pocket. I scrambled to pull it out and point it out into the woods too. I had no idea where or at what I should have been pointing, though, so I just kept fidgeting around where Jules wasn't. I backed up toward the cliffside wall again.{&1310}\par Something moved. {&1310}\par I snapped that way.{&1310}\par Nothing there.{&1310}\par I sucked in a breath. And it rattled back out through my teeth.{&1310}\par Over there.{&1310}\par I twisted back around.{&1310}\par The trees creaked in the wind. There was a loud clicking sound.{&1310}\par "Jules ...!"{&1310}\par The Eluvian man glanced back over his shoulder, almost outside the light of the fire.{&1310}\par "Quiet!"{&1310}\par The air rushed. I couldn't see it until it was already there, but I felt it. And it was on top of Jules before he could even turn back around.{&1310}\par I'd loosed a couple wild shots at him before I could stop myself.{&1310}\par The night lit up. For a few seconds, at least. That light on the rifle flickered wildly all over the place. I couldn't even tell where it was anymore after those few seconds. I heard Jules grunting aloud in the dark beyond the fire, and then he was abruptly gone. Everything went dark and quiet outside that flickering ring of light.{&1310}\par "J-Jules?"{&1310}\par I was trying to wedge myself down into the corner between the ground and the cliffside without realizing, that pistol shaking wildly out in my hands ahead. Nothing moved, and nothing made a sound for a few more seconds. Just me, and my quivering chest rattling out in the dark.{&1310}\par "Jules!"{&1310}\par There was a rustling in the trees a ways out. Not even close, and I stared. A couple flashes of light pierced the night out there - so far away that I blinked, wondering what else could possibly be hiding in the dark with us. Funny how I hardly cared one way or another about that Eluvian man until now. When he was the only thing between us and whatever the hell those things were out there.{&1310}\par Someone groaned. It took me a minute, but I realized it was Ev. She stirred there beside the fire. I had almost forgotten about her, and now that made me forget about Jules. I lowered the gun and scrambled over to her side.{&1310}\par Her eyes snapped open.{&1310}\par "Ev?"{&1310}\par I reached out a shaky hand to the other woman's shoulder. She was awake of a sudden and staring blankly up at the night above with some kind of sickly grimace on her face. Tears were glinting in streams out the sides of her eyes down toward the dirt.{&1310}\par "Ev!"{&1310}\par I didn't think she heard me.{&1310}\par A few more shots went off. Closer this time. My head whipped back toward the trees, but I couldn't see anything. Things got quiet again as soon as I did. I remembered the gun, and thrust it over that way.{&1310}\par I waited.{&1310}\par And waited.{&1310}\par ... and waited.{&1310}\par My ragged breaths and Ev's whispered groans were the only thing I heard for a long time. And, for a long time, nothing moved out in that black wilderness.{&1310}\par Then something came tearing through the brush. Right at me.{&1310}\par I fired. And I kept firing. I kept firing until I saw that Eluvian man's face.{&1310}\par Then I stopped.{&1310}\par I stared, for a second, at him bent over there with his hands protecting his head. He had collapsed to one side against the trunk of a tree. As soon as I let up, though, he glanced up at me with a feverish look in his eye. Then he collapsed down into the dirt.{&1310}\par "FUCK!"{&1310}\par I screamed, and fired a few more times into the trees. Nothing took. That I could see, at least. When things settled down quickly after that without a sound, I looked at the Eluvian man in the dirt.{&1310}\par "Jules?"{&1310}\par {&1310}\par I tried my quaky voice again. But he didn't bother to move on my account.{&1310}\par Oh god. {&1310}\par I'd killed him.{&1310}\par "... Jules!"{&1310}\par This time, it came out as barely more than a squeak.{&1310}\par He suddenly turned his head to one side, and spat out some blood into the dirt.{&1310}\par "Stop," he grunted, and growled, breathing hard, "calling me that."{&1310}\par I just stared at him, wide-eyed - suddenly wanting to laugh. But I couldn't. He started trying to pick himself up from the ground and crawl over my way. After an awkward moment, unsure what to do, I scrambled over to help.{&1310}\par "What the hell was \i that\i0 ?" I all but shrieked in his face when I got a hand on him. I forgot about it as soon as I got a good look at his face and the holes in him, though. It was tricky in the flickering light, but I could see the blood running down from his forehead, soaking his eyebrow, and the stained puncture in his jacket. "Are you all right?" I whispered frantically at him instead.{&1310}\par "I ... I don't know," he struggled with that, and I freaked out a bit more until I realized it was the answer to the first question. He pushed me away in response to the second, and hobbled over toward the fire. "Lucky you aren't any good with that," he mumbled under his breath.{&1310}\par Jules winced and plopped himself back down next to his pack, and I kept glancing back over toward the woods. No singe marks. I thought, frantically looking his beaten body over. Maybe I hadn't even hit him.{&1310}\par Small favors.{&1310}\par "We need to move," he said aloud at me, pulling something out of his things after wrestling, one-handed with it for a few seconds. It looked like one of those needles he had stuck Ev with the other night.{&1310}\par "What? How?" I babbled at him. "You can't even walk!"{&1310}\par He stabbed himself with that needle under his jacket near the hole that had been punched through it before I could do anything else. I gasped in surprise, but he got too busy convulsing violently. A couple seconds of that and then settled back down, stiff as a board.{&1310}\par "I'll be fine," he growled at me when he was done, his voice thin and strained.{&1310}\par "What about Ev!"{&1310}\par He was leaning back against the cliffside at a rigid angle, bloody face turned up and not seeing me as those hard eyes stared away into space. "I'll get her," he said simply. "Grab one of the," he twitched abruptly, wincing again, "logs from the fire."{&1310}\par "What? I'm not touching that!"{&1310}\par "Do it!" he hissed, eyes squeezing shut. He hefted his rifle awkwardly in one hand, the other pressed tight to the side of his chest with that hole. I don't know if he would have shot me for almost blowing his head off this time, but I dove toward the fire without thinking just the same, and dithered with one of those flaming pieces of wood a few seconds before I got a grip on it.{&1310}\par "Okay ..." I sat there with that flaming stick of wood in one hand, and my wide-eyed, terrified self in the other. "What do I do now?"{&1310}\par He chose that moment to come back to life, pulling himself back up and slowly climbing to his feet. {&1310}\par "Get behind me." {&1310}\par He stumbled over toward Ev, still comatose with her eyes open on the ground. That gave him a second's pause before he bent down to swing her up over one shoulder. {&1310}\par "Keep that ... sidearm ready," he grunted under the raven-haired woman's weight. She almost took him down, but he pushed right through it and had her up again. I just got in around behind him, shaking all over with the gun wobbling in hand. He canted his head.{&1310}\par "This way. Move."{&1310}\par And we started off into that black wood. But I never stopped looking back.\cf2\f1 {&1310}\par }{&1310}
