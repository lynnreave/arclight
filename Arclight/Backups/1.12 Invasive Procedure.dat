The shuttle slowly righted itself and spun back towards the station. And right at incoming anti-boarding defense turret fire.{&1310}\par "I'm not attacking!" I screamed at those uncaring plasma bolts flying right at me. Not that they listened. I had a few seconds to try and evade and no real piloting ability to know how to do that. The shuttled dipped and swerved, thrusters going into overdrive and kicking me forward. I managed that much at least before that turret fire hurtled into me.{&1310}\par I squeezed my eyes shut, clenching my teeth and waiting for the hull to burst open all around me and ...{&1310}\par ...

I felt myself screaming back and I couldn't tell if it was with my body or just inside my mind.{&1310}\par Rage.{&1310}\par White.{&1310}\par Pain.{&1310}\par Then it was like I'd grown a thousand times my own size and that thing was suddenly weak and powerless in comparison. I slapped it so hard with ethereal hands that it vanished completely, and I was in control of myself again.{&1310}\par For a brief moment, I could almost feel a hole there. Like a reverberation of that overwhelming force I'd used to eject dad from my head. A hole in my consciousness.{&1310}\par Then the cockpit came screaming back in existence around me and I was choking on my own tongue.{&1310}\par My hand pushed forward, and the shuttle dove. But not before a blast of turret fire struck home.{&1310}\par Everything went dark as the shuttle screamed out at me. I was dead and dad had been the one who'd ended up doing it ... {&1310}\par After \i everything\i0  I'd already been through.{&1310}\par Dad.{&1310}\par The hull started to rip open. I felt the air whipping up to get sucked out as the shuttle split open up top like giant hands unwraveling a metal wrapper. I snatched at the hood on my suit and tried to pull it around my head before I was exposed to vacuum, but I was too slow.{&1310}\par Then the shuttle hit something.{&1310}\par Everything lurched, and I nearly forgot about the hull tearing open. The console blew up in my face and my restraints snapped as tight as they could, holding me in place. Resistance. I felt the hull collide and then slowly pass through something. It abruptly upended once it was on the other side. Artificial gravity snatched the wrecked, flaming hulk and the cracked port view swerved from an open bay to the deck. Which we promptly crashed right into.{&1310}\par Nose first into the ground, I watched through the busted front port and held onto the pilot's chair for dear life. The restraints held when the hull slammed down, trying to throw me down with it. They were meant to. I'd think. Which was lucky for me, because then the shuttle started to groan some more as the aft section slowly moved forward with the port still crunched against the deck. And all I could think to do as we started to tip was wrap my arms around my head and squeeze my eyes shut.{&1310}\par Artificial gravity from the station first tugged me forward from the chair, then shifted while we moved, overpowering the shuttle's weaker fields -- which were probably dead now anyways. The shuttle screamed out and collapsed in on itself, belly up against the deck. Metal and electronics exploded all around me in a fiery cacophony as the thing finally died a quick, painful death after being shot open and rammed into the bay shields. Then it went still.{&1310}\par Eventually, I opened my eyes again.{&1310}\par Well. {&1310}\par I wasn't \i dead\i0  yet.{&1310}\par But I \i was\i0  completely upside down in a wreck. And on the station, at least. Somehow. Luck? I hadn't gotten myself spaced.{&1310}\par The pilot's chair was at an angle to the top of the cockpit -- now crushed against the floor -- and my hair was hanging down to the deck that was peeking up through huge tears in the hull below. Debris was all over the place, pops of sparks going off all around the wreck like the shuttle's rattling final breaths before complete death. I put a hand to the ground and used the other one to undo the restraints on my chair. They wouldn't come undone with the release and I had to find that knife again where it had fallen -- \i just \i0 in reach -- on the floor so I could cut myself free. And then I nearly landed on top of it and gutted myself as I abruptly broke out and flopped sideways down into the wrecked hull. I had time to wonder about whether or not this thing had maybe had an ejection command I should have used instead while I lay there on the flat of the blade with the wind knocked out of me. Used \i before\i0  we'd landed face down on the station, that is.{&1310}\par Breaking through the shields must have ripped open the shuttle, which made it much easier to crawl my way out. Really, I was lucky those bay shields hadn't just pulverised me in the first place. And that I'd hit the bay instead of the station hull. And that they'd acted more like a speed bump while crashing headfirst into this place than a barrier. I guess I knew firsthand whether or not a shuttle could survive crashing into the station's shields at least. You know, in case anyone ever wanted to know.{&1310}\par When I finally got to standing up inside the docking bay proper outside, I started to feel how badly banged up I really was -- which really wasn't much, considering I'd just rammed a shuttle into the station. I had more scratches than I could count, especially fresh ones on my arms from low-crawling out of the wreck, and what felt like bruised ribs and hips and shoulders and -- \i everyhere\i0  ... But it was that hole in my stomach that stung the most. I couldn't get a good look at it now with the suit on, and I'd been in too much of a hurry back in that airlock to even think about it then. So I couldn't tell how deep it was, but I pressed some fingers gingerly to the spot and felt the fabric of my undershirt stick to flesh underneath like blood had soaked through. I didn't \i feel\i0  like I was bleeding to death, but thinking about it made me suddenly feel lightheaded.{&1310}\par I fought with nausea for a few seconds, stumbling and limping further into the docking bay. Somehow, I was alone. A few other shuttles lay motionless at other ends of the bay in various states of preparation but ... no people. The dull sounds of station klaxons were all I heard, echoing dully around the bay.{&1310}\par That pistol I'd stolen from the woman on the shuttle was in one hand now, the marine's combat knife in the other. I fumbled to tuck them both in the utility belt of the space suit I was still wearing without a faceplate in place while I staggered off toward an emergency medical station, fighting off the urge to vomit there on the floor. That desperate escape caught up with me in a rush now that adrenaline was dying down and I had to fight off my body just wanting to collapse in a heap on the deck too. It would've been easy to lie down, pass out, and wait for someone else to do the rescuing. It would've been easy ... if I was sure there'd even \i be\i0  a station tomorrow. And if I didn't suddenly feel like something terrible wasn't about to burst into the shuttle bay at any second.{&1310}\par I managed to get to the EMS and found a few stims for small wounds, and a local anesthetic. They'd made us practice some mundane details of field triage back at the academy, but nothing too involved. First things first, I ended up ripping open the suit at the collar to get at my side and finally got a look at the wound. The shirt \i was\i0  soaked through like I had thought,  and I stared at it with a vague sense of despair at first. Desperation gave me enough courage to overcome my hatred of syringes, though, so I only hesitated for a few seconds at most before stabbing those injectors in my side near the wound. I tried not to think about it as I pushed down on the plungers. But I was on the floor abruptly after I was done, head feeling stuffed so full of nothing that I couldn't have stood up straight. Even so, the pain was melting away.{&1310}\par It took a minute, but my head cleared. God, I hated needles. I pulled myself back up and dug into the medical supplies again for some body gauze and managed to get my stomach clumsily wrapped up so I wouldn't just end up bleeding out eventually anyways, even though if it had been that bad it probably would've already killed me by now.{&1310}\par Now ...{&1310}\par Now that I wasn't being chased by flesh-eating monsters, choked to death by vacuum, or hunted by ... by -- \i whoever\i0  it was that wanted me to get to dad -- now ... I finally had time to take stock of the situation.{&1310}\par The station was under attack. Obviously. By pirates or Tau? It only mattered a little. Dad was still alive. \i Okay\i0 . He was trying to find me, so I should find him first. My wrist comm was busted from that guy punching it, though, so I needed a comm linkup. This room might not stay empty or unnoticed forever either and there \i were\i0  boarders on the station. I didn't know how many or what state security was in so I couldn't just stay here. I needed to move, but the thoroughfares were probably just as dangerous as anywhere right now. Maybe more so depending on what this was all about, which I, of course, had no idea about at all.{&1310}\par Oh my god what about Tess?{&1310}\par What had happened to Tess? I had \i no\i0  idea. Dad was alive, sure, but it's not like my best friend was psychokinetic or I had a comm that wasn't broken she could reach me on. The thought that she might be dead suddenly froze me in place and made my blood run cold.{&1310}\par There was a comm station nearby for the bay operators and I practically charged the thing. At first, the terminal wouldn't even come up because it said it was in "Emergency Mode" and access was restricted. But my panicked brain knew enough to hit the emergency communications button to get past that. And then I-{&1310}\par "Shit. \i Shit\i0 !"{&1310}\par I couldn't remember Tess's comm ID number. {&1310}\par I didn't know it off the top of my head! I'd -- I'd had it on quickcall for so long and I'd dialed her up manually ever since and my comm had \i never\i0  been broken before -- I was so careful about those things -- but I ... I ...{&1310}\par I'd been through only god really knew what in the last twenty-four hours trying to stay alive and get the hell out of that nightmare I'd woken up in. And now the station was being attacked. Our \i home\i0  was being attacked. Who even knew what Tess had gone through in all that time?{&1310}\par It was like running right into a brick wall. I was starting to tear up, and I had to swipe at my eyes and breathe to get myself back under control. I had to think. Think, think, think -- \i think\i0 ! It had been years but ... I'd memorized it once. If I could just remember ...{&1310}\par But I only got a few numbers in before I wasn't sure of \i anything \i0 being real or if I just made it up to fill in the memory. I pounded my fists into the comms, and the screen fizzled and warped.{&1310}\par \i God damnit, Tess! If you hadn't hacked your own comm out of the system registry in the first place -- this wouldn't be a fucking problem right now!\i0 {&1310}\par For once, I fucking wished that station security had caught on to her. Or that I hadn't helped keep her fucking secret. Or that her \i fucking\i0  comm was in the \i fucking\i0  registry!{&1310}\par "DAMN IT!"{&1310}\par I slumped against the terminal, not caring at how it suddenly glitched up. I wanted to take the pistol and just shoot the thing like it would make the problem go away. Maybe it would. I considered it.{&1310}\par No.{&1310}\par \i Damn it, Tess, if you're dead I'll\i0  ...{&1310}\par \i I'll\i0  ...{&1310}\par Do nothing? What could I do? What could \i anyone\i0  do?{&1310}\par It was partway through just falling apart there feeling sorry for myself and miserable that I realized that I could just call someone else who had a working comm with Tess on it. Dad wouldn't have had it -- he'd stopped paying attention to who I hung out with years ago. But ... Bertram.{&1310}\par Bertram!{&1310}\par I straightened up and did a search for Bertram. \i He \i0 was in the system. \i He\i0  hadn't tried to covertly take himself out so he could mess around with people's private correspondence or low-level classified files. \i He\i0  had a bar that he needed to keep known and advertised.{&1310}\par I got Bertram's ID out of the registry and called him up on the emergency feed.{&1310}\par It took a long time to go through. \i Too\i0  long. And I had to check the nearest bay doors a few times while I waited, thinking I might have heard something out there over the sounds of the klaxons. It made me pull that pistol back out just in case.{&1310}\par "Evie?"{&1310}\par I whipped back around at that abrupt sound of my name and found myself looking at a familiar, pudgy face.{&1310}\par For a second, I was so relieved and excited and overwhelmed by the actual sight of someone I knew and cared about -- even over an emergency terminal -- that I forget what I was going to say. I felt like I'd been lost in another world for days -- \i week\i0 s -- alone, and without anyone. Lost. And I just stared dumbly at that old man with wide eyes about to tear up and let loose again before I could stop them.{&1310}\par "Evie?" he tried again.{&1310}\par "Y-yes," I managed to choke out, my voice suddenly thick and hoarse in my own ears. "I'm here, Bertram. It's me!"{&1310}\par "You look terrible, Evie, are you alright?"{&1310}\par "Yeah ... I'm -- I'm fine," I lied. I didn't want to talk about myself or where I'd been so I cut right into it first. "Bertram, where's Tess? Is she okay?"{&1310}\par There was the distant echo of small arms fire and my body twisted back around toward the bay behind me instantly. The gun was up and pointing wildly at everything that stood out as I quickly scanned the room again. But it wasn't here. It wasn't on my end.{&1310}\par "Evie!"{&1310}\par I spun right back around.{&1310}\par "Bertram?"{&1310}\par The old man crouched down -- I could only tell by the outline of the scene behind him since he was talking into his wrist comm, not a terminal. And, for the first time, I saw the haggard lines on his face, the ash on his forehead, and trace of blood down one cheek from a gash opened up across his temple. People were yelling in the background and they could have been soldiers. He might have been in his bar, but there was no way to tell from here. I'd just assumed everything was as it always had been when I'd first seen him. I was so very wrong.{&1310}\par "Evie, listen to me," he coughed out, and spat as smoke filled the air and the terminal image. "I don't know where Tess is, but you've gotta get yerself somewhere safe ... You're fath--"{&1310}\par An explosion.{&1310}\par The station reverberated around Bertram and black smoke poured over his comm, obscuring him from me. He cut off and all I could hear was his wheezing breath somewhere in the smog, then him trying to cough up a lung.{&1310}\par "Bertram--?"{&1310}\par The feed cut out abruptly, and I was left with a blank terminal sporting only the Dreggoran Navy ensignia staring back at me. I hadn't realized it until just then but my face was only centimeters from the screen. And that was all I could do for a few minutes -- stare.{&1310}\par Bertram had said he didn't know where Tess was. He'd barely gotten a chance to say anything at \i all\i0  before that blast had cut him off. It had sounded like fighting. Was he even at his bar? Where was Tess? Did she even know that her adopted father could have been dead right now for all I knew?{&1310}\par That thought stopped me cold.{&1310}\par \i Bertram \i0 ...{&1310}\par I had to get to them. I had to \i find\i0  them.{&1310}\par Now.{&1310}\par I had stared at that screen for too long without doing anything. By the time I reached out again it had locked up. And when I tried to load up another emergency feed and find someone else, the lights dimmed in the middle of it until they were gone and I was in darkness.{&1310}\par Panic froze me. For a moment, I was back in that dead research tower with those things all around me. I could \i hear\i0  one of them chewing on a corpse somewhere behind me in the dark and I turned around. Slowly.{&1310}\par The pistol was in my hand, shaking wildly though I couldn't see it. I raised it at that noise. Slowly. So slowly. Somehow, I was sure it was useless and would do nothing. Somehow, I knew I was already dead and pulling the trigger would just make it happen faster.{&1310}\par I couldn't fight. I couldn't run.{&1310}\par I was dead.{&1310}\par Then the lights came back on.{&1310}\par Power returned in a kick and a whirl, bringing the whole bay back to life in a sputtering gasp.{&1310}\par Someone was standing there.{&1310}\par The gun went off on its own. On reflex. My hand fired at that thing before my brain could even catch up with it.{&1310}\par Except it wasn't one of those monsters crouching there, mindlessly devouring some dead person's body.{&1310}\par It was Mills.{&1310}\par {&1310}\par \cf2\f1 {&1310}\par }{&1310}

But not before a blast of turret fire struck home.{&1310}\par Everything went dark as the shuttle screamed out at me. I was dead and dad had been the one who'd ended up doing it ... {&1310}\par After \i everything\i0  I'd already been through.{&1310}\par Dad.{&1310}\par The hull started to rip open. I felt the air whipping up to get sucked out as the shuttle split open up top like giant hands unwraveling a metal wrapper. I snatched at the hood on my suit and tried to pull it around my head before I was exposed to vacuum, but I was too slow.{&1310}\par Then the shuttle hit something.{&1310}\par Everything lurched, and I nearly forgot about the hull tearing open. The console blew up in my face and my restraints snapped as tight as they could, holding me in place. Resistance. I felt the hull collide and then slowly pass through something. It abruptly upended once it was on the other side. Artificial gravity snatched the wrecked, flaming hulk and the cracked port view swerved from an open bay to the deck. Which we promptly crashed right into.{&1310}\par Nose first into the ground, I watched through the busted front port and held onto the pilot's chair for dear life. The restraints held when the hull slammed down, trying to throw me down with it. They were meant to. I'd think. Which was lucky for me, because then the shuttle started to groan some more as the aft section slowly moved forward with the port still crunched against the deck. And all I could think to do as we started to tip was wrap my arms around my head and squeeze my eyes shut.{&1310}\par Artificial gravity from the station first tugged me forward from the chair, then shifted while we moved, overpowering the shuttle's weaker fields -- which were probably dead now anyways. The shuttle screamed out and collapsed in on itself, belly up against the deck. Metal and electronics exploded all around me in a fiery cacophony as the thing finally died a quick, painful death after being shot open and rammed into the bay shields. Then it went still.{&1310}\par Eventually, I opened my eyes again.{&1310}\par Well. {&1310}\par I wasn't \i dead\i0  yet.{&1310}\par But I \i was\i0  completely upside down in a wreck. And on the station, at least. Somehow. Luck? I hadn't gotten myself spaced.{&1310}\par The pilot's chair was at an angle to the top of the cockpit -- now crushed against the floor -- and my hair was hanging down to the deck that was peeking up through huge tears in the hull below. Debris was all over the place, pops of sparks going off all around the wreck like the shuttle's rattling final breaths before complete death. I put a hand to the ground and used the other one to undo the restraints on my chair. They wouldn't come undone with the release and I had to find that knife again where it had fallen -- \i just \i0 in reach -- on the floor so I could cut myself free. And then I nearly landed on top of it and gutted myself as I abruptly broke out and flopped sideways down into the wrecked hull. I had time to wonder about whether or not this thing had maybe had an ejection command I should have used instead while I lay there on the flat of the blade with the wind knocked out of me. Used \i before\i0  we'd landed face down on the station, that is.{&1310}\par Breaking through the shields must have ripped open the shuttle, which made it much easier to crawl my way out. Really, I was lucky those bay shields hadn't just pulverised me in the first place. And that I'd hit the bay instead of the station hull. And that they'd acted more like a speed bump while crashing headfirst into this place than a barrier. I guess I knew firsthand whether or not a shuttle could survive crashing into the station's shields at least. You know, in case anyone ever wanted to know.{&1310}\par When I finally got to standing up inside the docking bay proper outside, I started to feel how badly banged up I really was -- which really wasn't much, considering I'd just rammed a shuttle into the station. I had more scratches than I could count, especially fresh ones on my arms from low-crawling out of the wreck, and what felt like bruised ribs and hips and shoulders and -- \i everyhere\i0  ... But it was that hole in my stomach that stung the most. I couldn't get a good look at it now with the suit on, and I'd been in too much of a hurry back in that airlock to even think about it then. So I couldn't tell how deep it was, but I pressed some fingers gingerly to the spot and felt the fabric of my undershirt stick to flesh underneath like blood had soaked through. I didn't \i feel\i0  like I was bleeding to death, but thinking about it made me suddenly feel lightheaded.{&1310}\par I fought with nausea for a few seconds, stumbling and limping further into the docking bay. Somehow, I was alone. A few other shuttles lay motionless at other ends of the bay in various states of preparation but ... no people. The dull sounds of station klaxons were all I heard, echoing dully around the bay.{&1310}\par That pistol I'd stolen from the woman on the shuttle was in one hand now, the marine's combat knife in the other. I fumbled to tuck them both in the utility belt of the space suit I was still wearing without a faceplate in place while I staggered off toward an emergency medical station, fighting off the urge to vomit there on the floor. That desperate escape caught up with me in a rush now that adrenaline was dying down and I had to fight off my body just wanting to collapse in a heap on the deck too. It would've been easy to lie down, pass out, and wait for someone else to do the rescuing. It would've been easy ... if I was sure there'd even \i be\i0  a station tomorrow. And if I didn't suddenly feel like something terrible wasn't about to burst into the shuttle bay at any second.{&1310}\par I managed to get to the EMS and found a few stims for small wounds, and a local anesthetic. They'd made us practice some mundane details of field triage back at the academy, but nothing too involved. First things first, I ended up ripping open the suit at the collar to get at my side and finally got a look at the wound. The shirt \i was\i0  soaked through like I had thought,  and I stared at it with a vague sense of despair at first. Desperation gave me enough courage to overcome my hatred of syringes, though, so I only hesitated for a few seconds at most before stabbing those injectors in my side near the wound. I tried not to think about it as I pushed down on the plungers. But I was on the floor abruptly after I was done, head feeling stuffed so full of nothing that I couldn't have stood up straight. Even so, the pain was melting away.{&1310}\par It took a minute, but my head cleared. God, I hated needles. I pulled myself back up and dug into the medical supplies again for some body gauze and managed to get my stomach clumsily wrapped up so I wouldn't just end up bleeding out eventually anyways, even though if it had been that bad it probably would've already killed me by now.{&1310}\par Now ...{&1310}\par Now that I wasn't being chased by flesh-eating monsters, choked to death by vacuum, or hunted by ... by -- \i whoever\i0  it was that wanted me to get to dad -- now ... I finally had time to take stock of the situation.{&1310}\par The station was under attack. Obviously. By pirates or Tau? It only mattered a little. Dad was still alive. \i Okay\i0 . He was trying to find me, so I should find him first. My wrist comm was busted from that guy punching it, though, so I needed a comm linkup. This room might not stay empty or unnoticed forever either and there \i were\i0  boarders on the station. I didn't know how many or what state security was in so I couldn't just stay here. I needed to move, but the thoroughfares were probably just as dangerous as anywhere right now. Maybe more so depending on what this was all about, which I, of course, had no idea about at all.{&1310}\par Oh my god what about Tess?{&1310}\par What had happened to Tess? I had \i no\i0  idea. Dad was alive, sure, but it's not like my best friend was psychokinetic or I had a comm that wasn't broken she could reach me on. The thought that she might be dead suddenly froze me in place and made my blood run cold.{&1310}\par There was a comm station nearby for the bay operators and I practically charged the thing. At first, the terminal wouldn't even come up because it said it was in "Emergency Mode" and access was restricted. But my panicked brain knew enough to hit the emergency communications button to get past that. And then I-{&1310}\par "Shit. \i Shit\i0 !"{&1310}\par I couldn't remember Tess's comm ID number. {&1310}\par I didn't know it off the top of my head! I'd -- I'd had it on quickcall for so long and I'd dialed her up manually ever since and my comm had \i never\i0  been broken before -- I was so careful about those things -- but I ... I ...{&1310}\par I'd been through only god really knew what in the last twenty-four hours trying to stay alive and get the hell out of that nightmare I'd woken up in. And now the station was being attacked. Our \i home\i0  was being attacked. Who even knew what Tess had gone through in all that time?{&1310}\par It was like running right into a brick wall. I was starting to tear up, and I had to swipe at my eyes and breathe to get myself back under control. I had to think. Think, think, think -- \i think\i0 ! It had been years but ... I'd memorized it once. If I could just remember ...{&1310}\par But I only got a few numbers in before I wasn't sure of \i anything \i0 being real or if I just made it up to fill in the memory. I pounded my fists into the comms, and the screen fizzled and warped.{&1310}\par \i God damnit, Tess! If you hadn't hacked your own comm out of the system registry in the first place -- this wouldn't be a fucking problem right now!\i0 {&1310}\par For once, I fucking wished that station security had caught on to her. Or that I hadn't helped keep her fucking secret. Or that her \i fucking\i0  comm was in the \i fucking\i0  registry!{&1310}\par "DAMN IT!"{&1310}\par I slumped against the terminal, not caring at how it suddenly glitched up. I wanted to take the pistol and just shoot the thing like it would make the problem go away. Maybe it would. I considered it.{&1310}\par No.{&1310}\par \i Damn it, Tess, if you're dead I'll\i0  ...{&1310}\par \i I'll\i0  ...{&1310}\par Do nothing? What could I do? What could \i anyone\i0  do?{&1310}\par It was partway through just falling apart there feeling sorry for myself and miserable that I realized that I could just call someone else who had a working comm with Tess on it. Dad wouldn't have had it -- he'd stopped paying attention to who I hung out with years ago. But ... Bertram.{&1310}\par Bertram!{&1310}\par I straightened up and did a search for Bertram. \i He \i0 was in the system. \i He\i0  hadn't tried to covertly take himself out so he could mess around with people's private correspondence or low-level classified files. \i He\i0  had a bar that he needed to keep known and advertised.{&1310}\par I got Bertram's ID out of the registry and called him up on the emergency feed.{&1310}\par It took a long time to go through. \i Too\i0  long. And I had to check the nearest bay doors a few times while I waited, thinking I might have heard something out there over the sounds of the klaxons. It made me pull that pistol back out just in case.{&1310}\par "Evie?"{&1310}\par I whipped back around at that abrupt sound of my name and found myself looking at a familiar, pudgy face.{&1310}\par For a second, I was so relieved and excited and overwhelmed by the actual sight of someone I knew and cared about -- even over an emergency terminal -- that I forget what I was going to say. I felt like I'd been lost in another world for days -- \i week\i0 s -- alone, and without anyone. Lost. And I just stared dumbly at that old man with wide eyes about to tear up and let loose again before I could stop them.{&1310}\par "Evie?" he tried again.{&1310}\par "Y-yes," I managed to choke out, my voice suddenly thick and hoarse in my own ears. "I'm here, Bertram. It's me!"{&1310}\par "You look terrible, Evie, are you alright?"{&1310}\par "Yeah ... I'm -- I'm fine," I lied. I didn't want to talk about myself or where I'd been so I cut right into it first. "Bertram, where's Tess? Is she okay?"{&1310}\par There was the distant echo of small arms fire and my body twisted back around toward the bay behind me instantly. The gun was up and pointing wildly at everything that stood out as I quickly scanned the room again. But it wasn't here. It wasn't on my end.{&1310}\par "Evie!"{&1310}\par I spun right back around.{&1310}\par "Bertram?"{&1310}\par The old man crouched down -- I could only tell by the outline of the scene behind him since he was talking into his wrist comm, not a terminal. And, for the first time, I saw the haggard lines on his face, the ash on his forehead, and trace of blood down one cheek from a gash opened up across his temple. People were yelling in the background and they could have been soldiers. He might have been in his bar, but there was no way to tell from here. I'd just assumed everything was as it always had been when I'd first seen him. I was so very wrong.{&1310}\par "Evie, listen to me," he coughed out, and spat as smoke filled the air and the terminal image. "I don't know where Tess is, but you've gotta get yerself somewhere safe ... You're fath--"{&1310}\par An explosion.{&1310}\par The station reverberated around Bertram and black smoke poured over his comm, obscuring him from me. He cut off and all I could hear was his wheezing breath somewhere in the smog, then him trying to cough up a lung.{&1310}\par "Bertram--?"{&1310}\par The feed cut out abruptly, and I was left with a blank terminal sporting only the Dreggoran Navy ensignia staring back at me. I hadn't realized it until just then but my face was only centimeters from the screen. And that was all I could do for a few minutes -- stare.{&1310}\par Bertram had said he didn't know where Tess was. He'd barely gotten a chance to say anything at \i all\i0  before that blast had cut him off. It had sounded like fighting. Was he even at his bar? Where was Tess? Did she even know that her adopted father could have been dead right now for all I knew?{&1310}\par That thought stopped me cold.{&1310}\par \i Bertram \i0 ...{&1310}\par I had to get to them. I had to \i find\i0  them.{&1310}\par Now.{&1310}\par I had stared at that screen for too long without doing anything. By the time I reached out again it had locked up. And when I tried to load up another emergency feed and find someone else, the lights dimmed in the middle of it until they were gone and I was in darkness.{&1310}\par Panic froze me. For a moment, I was back in that dead research tower with those things all around me. I could \i hear\i0  one of them chewing on a corpse somewhere behind me in the dark and I turned around. Slowly.{&1310}\par The pistol was in my hand, shaking wildly though I couldn't see it. I raised it at that noise. Slowly. So slowly. Somehow, I was sure it was useless and would do nothing. Somehow, I knew I was already dead and pulling the trigger would just make it happen faster.{&1310}\par I couldn't fight. I couldn't run.{&1310}\par I was dead.{&1310}\par Then the lights came back on.{&1310}\par Power returned in a kick and a whirl, bringing the whole bay back to life in a sputtering gasp.{&1310}\par Someone was standing there.{&1310}\par The gun went off on its own. On reflex. My hand fired at that thing before my brain could even catch up with it.{&1310}\par Except it wasn't one of those monsters crouching there, mindlessly devouring some dead person's body.{&1310}\par It was Mills.{&1310}\par {&1310}\par \cf2\f1 {&1310}\par }{&1310}

I was dead and dad had been the one who'd ended up doing it ... after \i everything\i0  I'd already been through.{&1310}\par Dad.{&1310}\par The hull started to rip open. I felt the air whipping up to get sucked out as the shuttle split open up top like giant hands unwraveling a metal wrapper. I snatched at the hood on my suit and tried to pull it around my head before I was exposed to vacuum, but I was too slow.{&1310}\par Then the shuttle hit something.{&1310}\par Everything lurched, and I nearly forgot about the hull tearing open. The console blew up in my face and my restraints snapped as tight as they could, holding me in place. Resistance. I felt the hull collide and then slowly pass through something. It abruptly upended once it was through. Artificial gravity snatched the wrecked, flaming hulk and the cracked port view swerved from an open bay to the deck. Which we promptly crashed right into.{&1310}\par Nose first into the deck, I watched through the busted front port and held onto the pilot's chair for dear life. The restraints held whent he hull slammed down, trying to throw me down with it. They were meant to. I'd think. Which was lucky for me, because then the shuttle started to groan some more as the aft section slowly moved forward with the port still crunched against the deck. And all I could think to do as we started to tip was wrap my arms around my head and squeeze my eyes shut.{&1310}\par Artificial gravity from the station first tugged me forward from the chair, then shifted while we moved, overpowering the shuttle's weaker fields -- which were probably dead now anyways. The shuttle screamed out and collapsed in on itself, belly up against the deck. Metal and electronics exploded all around me in a fiery cacophony as the thing finally died a quick, painful death after being shot open and rammed into the bay shields. Then it went still.{&1310}\par Eventually, I opened my eyes again.{&1310}\par Well. I wasn't \i dead\i0  yet.{&1310}\par But I \i was\i0  completely upside down in a wreck.{&1310}\par The pilot's chair was at an angle to the top fo the cockpit -- now crushed against the floor -- and my hair was hanging down to the deck peeking up through huge tears below. Debris was all over the place, pops of sparks going off all around the wreck like the shuttle's rattling final breaths before complete death. I put a hand to the ground and used the other one to undo the restraints on my chair. They wouldn't come undone with the release and I had to find that knife again just in reach on the floor so I could cut myself free. And then I nearly landed on top of it and gutted myself as I abruptly broke out and flopped sideways down into the wrecked hull. I had time to wonder about whether or not this thing had maybe had an ejection command I should have used instead while I lay there on the flat of the blade with the wind knocked out of me. Used \i before\i0  we'd landed face down on the station, that is.{&1310}\par Breaking through the shields must have ripped open the shuttle, which made it much easier to crawl my way out. Really, I was lucky those bay shields hadn't just crushed me flat in the first place. And that I'd hit the bay instead of the station hull. And that they'd acted more like a speed bump while crashing headfirst into this place than a barrier. I guess I knew firsthand whether or not a shuttle could survive crashing into the station's shields at least. You know, in case anyone ever wanted to know.{&1310}\par When I finally got to standing up inside the docking bay proper outside, I started to feel how badly banged up I really was -- which wasn't much, considering I'd just rammed a shuttle into the station. I had more scratches than I could count, especially on my arms from low-crawling out of the wreck, but it was that hole in my stomach that stung the most. I finally got a good look at it now because I'd been in too much of a hurry to back in that airlock. I couldn't tell how deep it was, but a big splots of my shirt was soaked through there with blood and it was hard to tell if it had stopped. Thinking about it suddenly made me feel lightheaded.{&1310}\par I fought with nausea for a few seconds, stumbling further into the docking bay. Somehow, I was alone. A few other shuttles lay motionless at other ends of the bay in various states of preparation but ... no people. The dull sounds of station klaxons were all I heard, echoing dully around the bay.{&1310}\par That pistol I'd stolen from the woman on the shuttle was in one hand, the marine's combat knife in the other. I fumbled to tuck them both in the utility belt of the space suit I was still wearing without a faceplate in place while I staggered off toward an emergency medical station, fighting off the urge to vomit there on the floor. That desperate escape caught up with me in a rush now that adrenaline was dying down and I had to fight off my body just wanting to collapse in a heap on the deck too. It would've been easy to lie down, pass out, and wait for someone else to do the rescuing. It would've been easy ... if I was sure there'd even be a station tomorrow. And if I didn't suddenly feel like something terrible wasn't about to burst into the shuttle bay at any second.{&1310}\par I managed to get to the EMS and pulled out found a few stims for small wounds with a local anesthetic. They'd made us practice some mundane details of field triage back at the academy, but nothing too involved. Thankfully, I didn't think it was too bad, so I just hesitated for a few seconds and tried not to think about what I was doing before stabbing those injectors in my side near the wound. I was on the floor abruptly after that, head feeling stuff so full of nothing that I couldn't have stood up straight. But the pain was melting away.{&1310}\par It took a minute, but my head cleared. God, I hated needles. I pulled myself back up and dug into the medical supplies again for some body gauze and managed to get my stomach wrapped up so I wouldn't just end up bleeding out eventually anyways, even though if it had been that bad it probably would've already killed me by now.{&1310}\par Now ...{&1310}\par Now that I wasn't being chased by flesh-eating monsters, choked to death by vacuum, or hunted by ... by -- \i whoever\i0  it was that wanted me to get to dad -- now ... I finally had time to take stock of the situation.{&1310}\par The station was under attack. Obviously. By pirates or Tau? It only mattered a little. Dad was still alive. \i Okay\i0 . He was trying to find me, so I should find him first. My wrist comm was busted from that guy punching it, though, so I needed a comm linkup. This room might not stay empty or unnoticed forever either and there \i were\i0  boarders on the station. I didn't know how many or what state security was in so I couldn't just stay here. I needed to move, but the thoroughfares were probably just as dangerous as anywhere right now. Maybe more so depending on what this was all about, which I, of course, had no idea about at all.{&1310}\par Oh my god what about Tess?{&1310}\par What had happened to Tess? I had \i no\i0  idea. Dad was alive, sure, but it's not like my best friend was psychokinetic or I had a comm that wasn't broken she could reach me on. The thought that she might be dead suddenly froze me in place and made my blood run cold.{&1310}\par There was a comm station nearby for the bay operators and I practically charged the thing. At first, the terminal wouldn't even come up because it said it was in "Emergency Mode" and access was restricted. But my panicked brain knew enough to hit the emergency communications button to get past that. And then I-{&1310}\par "Shit. \i Shit\i0 !"{&1310}\par I couldn't remember Tess's comm ID number. I'd -- I'd had it on quickcall for so long and I'd dial her up manually since and my comm had \i never\i0  been broken before -- I was so careful about those things -- but I ... I ...{&1310}\par I was starting to tear up, and I had to swipe at my eyes and breathe to get myself back under control. I had to think. Think, think, think -- \i think\i0 ! It had been years but ... I'd memorized it once. If I could just remember ...{&1310}\par But I only got a few numbers in before I wasn't sure of anything being real or just imagined as part of her ID. I pounded my fists into the comms, and the screen fizzled and warped.{&1310}\par \i God damnit, Tess!{&1310}\par If you hadn't hacked your own comm out of the system registry in the first place -- this wouldn't be a fucking problem right now!\i0 {&1310}\par For once, I fucking wished that station security had caught on to her. Or that I hadn't helped keep her fucking secret. Or that her \i fucking\i0  comm was in the \i fucking\i0  registry!{&1310}\par "DAMN IT!"{&1310}\par I slumped against the terminal, not caring at how it suddenly glitched up. I wanted to take the pistol and just shoot the thing like it would make the problem go away. Maybe it would. I considered it.{&1310}\par No.{&1310}\par \i Damn it, Tess, if you're dead I'll\i0  ...{&1310}\par \i I'll\i0  ...{&1310}\par Do nothing? What could I do? What could \i anyone\i0  do?{&1310}\par It was partway through just falling apart there feeling sorry for myself and miserable that I realized that I could just call someone else who had a working comm with Tess on it. Dad wouldn't have had it -- he'd stopped paying attention to who I hung out with years ago. But ... Bertram.{&1310}\par Bertram!{&1310}\par I straighted up and did a search for Bertram. \i He \i0 was in the system. \i He\i0  hadn't tried to covertly take himself out so he could mess around with people's private correspondence or low-level classified files. \i He\i0  had a bar that he needed to keep known and advertised.{&1310}\par I got Bertram's ID out of the registry and called him up on the emergency feed.\cf2\f1 {&1310}\par }{&1310}

I had a split second to recognize that before it dawned on me that someone was shooting at me in this shuttle.{&1310}\par How-?{&1310}\par Another explosion somewhere else pitched me in the other direction. This one was even bigger than the last. My knuckles went white on the pilot's chair while the whole shuttle rolled over. Somehow, it didn't come apart and send me hurtling out into naked space right away.{&1310}\par Sparks flew at my face. The cockpit was flashing black and red now, secondary system lights flickering in and out while smoke hissed loudly somewhere behind me. And, on top of that, I realized the hull was drifting at a bad angle.{&1310}\par "Autopilot-?"{&1310}\par "Autopilot protocols damaged ... switching to manual pilot."{&1310}\par The shuttle jerked hard, and I felt propulsion give out with no more control. I stuck a hand out for the manual ones on the consoleahead of me and everything jerked the other way, going into a spin.{&1310}\par I had to push back agianst the chair to get two hands on the controls. The shuttle slowly righted itself and spun back towards the station. And right at incoming anti-boarding defense turret fire.{&1310}\par "I'm not attacking!" I scraemed at those uncaring plasma bolts flying right at me. Not that they listened. I had a few seconds to try and evade and no real piloting ability to know how to do that. The shuttled dipped and swerved, thrusters going into overdrive and kicking me forward. I managed that much at least before that turret fire hurtled into me.{&1310}\par I squeezed my eyes shut, clenching my teeth and waiting for the hull to burst open all around me and ...{&1310}\par ... Nothing.{&1310}\par They missed me.{&1310}\par One eye back open -- the shuttle was diving. I scrambled to right myself again with an effort, bringing Riftwatch back into view. And those turrets.{&1310}\par They'd been down when I'd watched those boarding craft shooting towad the station. Now they were firing at everything heading their way. And, of course, I was in an enemy, unidentified shuttlecraft. Someone must have gotten them back on.{&1310}\par At least that cruiser wasn't smart enough to shoot at me too.{&1310}\par I saw the line of fire from the turrets coming at me and I twisted the shuttle away again before they struck. A few more time and I was zigzagging awkwardly toward the station, but keeping from getting shot down in the process.{&1310}\par \i This ... isn't so hard\i0 .{&1310}\par Some of that desperation melted away into relief, making me feel lightheaded and excited as I realized I could dodge those turrets pretty easily. They were designed for boarding craft fire on a simple trajectory, of course, so a shuttle was too maneuverable for them. And, luckily, no one had managed to switch on the anti-fighter defenses yet.{&1310}\par Small favors.{&1310}\par \i Almost home\i0 , I thought as I veered in again toward the nearest shuttlebay on the station's underbelly. \i Just have to put in a valid docking code a-\i0 {&1310}\par I winced as a disturbingly familiar buzzing started in the back of my head. Then my whole body started to seize up.{&1310}\par \i Oh no \i0 ...{&1310}\par White noise surged in all around me and I lost any awareness of the cockpit.

I felt myself screaming back and I couldn't tell if it was with my body or just inside my mind.{&1310}\par Rage.{&1310}\par White.{&1310}\par Pain.{&1310}\par Then it was like I'd grown a thousand times my own size and that thing was suddenly weak and powerless in comparison. I slapped it so hard with ethereal hands that it vanished completely, and I was in control of myself again.{&1310}\par For a brief moment, I could almost feel a hole there. Like a reverberation of that overwhelming force I'd used to eject dad from my head. A hole in my consciousness.{&1310}\par Then the cockpit came screaming back in existence around me and I was choking on my own tongue.{&1310}\par My hand pushed forward, and the shuttle dove. But not before a blast of turret fire struck home.{&1310}\par Everything went dark as the shuttle screamed out at me. I was dead and dad had been the one who'd ended up doing it ... after \i everything\i0  I'd already been through.{&1310}\par Dad.{&1310}\par The hull started to rip open. I felt the air whipping up to get sucked out as the shuttle split open up top like giant hands unwraveling a metal wrapper. I snatched at the hood on my suit and tried to pull it around my head before I was exposed to vacuum, but I was too slow.{&1310}\par Then the shuttle hit something.{&1310}\par Everything lurched, and I nearly forgot about the hull tearing open. The console blew up in my face and my restraints snapped as tight as they could, holding me in place. Resistance. I felt the hull collide and then slowly pass through something. It abruptly upended once it was through. Artificial gravity snatched the wrecked, flaming hulk and the cracked port view swerved from an open bay to the deck. Which we promptly crashed right into.{&1310}\par Nose first into the deck, I watched through the busted front port and held onto the pilot's chair for dear life. The restraints held whent he hull slammed down, trying to throw me down with it. They were meant to. I'd think. Which was lucky for me, because then the shuttle started to groan some more as the aft section slowly moved forward with the port still crunched against the deck. And all I could think to do as we started to tip was wrap my arms around my head and squeeze my eyes shut.{&1310}\par Artificial gravity from the station first tugged me forward from the chair, then shifted while we moved, overpowering the shuttle's weaker fields -- which were probably dead now anyways. The shuttle screamed out and collapsed in on itself, belly up against the deck. Metal and electronics exploded all around me in a fiery cacophony as the thing finally died a quick, painful death after being shot open and rammed into the bay shields. Then it went still.{&1310}\par Eventually, I opened my eyes again.{&1310}\par Well. I wasn't \i dead\i0  yet.{&1310}\par But I \i was\i0  completely upside down in a wreck.{&1310}\par The pilot's chair was at an angle to the top fo the cockpit -- now crushed against the floor -- and my hair was hanging down to the deck peeking up through huge tears below. Debris was all over the place, pops of sparks going off all around the wreck like the shuttle's rattling final breaths before complete death. I put a hand to the ground and used the other one to undo the restraints on my chair. They wouldn't come undone with the release and I had to find that knife again just in reach on the floor so I could cut myself free. And then I nearly landed on top of it and gutted myself as I abruptly broke out and flopped sideways down into the wrecked hull. I had time to wonder about whether or not this thing had maybe had an ejection command I should have used instead while I lay there on the flat of the blade with the wind knocked out of me. Used \i before\i0  we'd landed face down on the station, that is.{&1310}\par Breaking through the shields must have ripped open the shuttle, which made it much easier to crawl my way out. Really, I was lucky those bay shields hadn't just crushed me flat in the first place. And that I'd hit the bay instead of the station hull. And that they'd acted more like a speed bump while crashing headfirst into this place than a barrier. I guess I knew firsthand whether or not a shuttle could survive crashing into the station's shields at least. You know, in case anyone ever wanted to know.{&1310}\par When I finally got to standing up inside the docking bay proper outside, I started to feel how badly banged up I really was -- which wasn't much, considering I'd just rammed a shuttle into the station. I had more scratches than I could count, especially on my arms from low-crawling out of the wreck, but it was that hole in my stomach that stung the most. I finally got a good look at it now because I'd been in too much of a hurry to back in that airlock. I couldn't tell how deep it was, but a big splots of my shirt was soaked through there with blood and it was hard to tell if it had stopped. Thinking about it suddenly made me feel lightheaded.{&1310}\par I fought with nausea for a few seconds, stumbling further into the docking bay. Somehow, I was alone. A few other shuttles lay motionless at other ends of the bay in various states of preparation but ... no people. The dull sounds of station klaxons were all I heard, echoing dully around the bay.{&1310}\par That pistol I'd stolen from the woman on the shuttle was in one hand, the marine's combat knife in the other. I fumbled to tuck them both in the utility belt of the space suit I was still wearing without a faceplate in place while I staggered off toward an emergency medical station, fighting off the urge to vomit there on the floor. That desperate escape caught up with me in a rush now that adrenaline was dying down and I had to fight off my body just wanting to collapse in a heap on the deck too. It would've been easy to lie down, pass out, and wait for someone else to do the rescuing. It would've been easy ... if I was sure there'd even be a station tomorrow. And if I didn't suddenly feel like something terrible wasn't about to burst into the shuttle bay at any second.{&1310}\par I managed to get to the EMS and pulled out found a few stims for small wounds with a local anesthetic. They'd made us practice some mundane details of field triage back at the academy, but nothing too involved. Thankfully, I didn't think it was too bad, so I just hesitated for a few seconds and tried not to think about what I was doing before stabbing those injectors in my side near the wound. I was on the floor abruptly after that, head feeling stuff so full of nothing that I couldn't have stood up straight. But the pain was melting away.{&1310}\par It took a minute, but my head cleared. God, I hated needles. I pulled myself back up and dug into the medical supplies again for some body gauze and managed to get my stomach wrapped up so I wouldn't just end up bleeding out eventually anyways, even though if it had been that bad it probably would've already killed me by now.{&1310}\par Now ...{&1310}\par Now that I wasn't being chased by flesh-eating monsters, choked to death by vacuum, or hunted by ... by -- \i whoever\i0  it was that wanted me to get to dad -- now ...

I wasn't \i dead\i0  yet.{&1310}\par But I \i was\i0  completely upside down in a wreck.{&1310}\par The pilot's chair was at an angle to the top fo the cockpit -- now crushed against the floor -- and my hair was hanging down to the deck peeking up through huge tears below. Debris was all over the place, pops of sparks going off all around the wreck like the shuttle's rattling final breaths before complete death. I put a hand to the ground and used the other one to undo the restraints on my chair. They wouldn't come undone with the release and I had to find that knife again just in reach on the floor so I could cut myself free. And then I nearly landed on top of it and gutted myself as I abruptly broke out and flopped sideways down into the wrecked hull. I had time to wonder about whether or not this thing had maybe had an ejection command I should have used instead while I lay there on the flat of the blade with the wind knocked out of me. Used \i before\i0  we'd landed face down on the station, that is.{&1310}\par Breaking through the shields must have ripped open the shuttle, which made it much easier to crawl my way out. Really, I was lucky those bay shields hadn't just crushed me flat in the first place. And that I'd hit the bay instead of the station hull. And that they'd acted more like a speed bump while crashing headfirst into this place than a barrier. I guess I knew firsthand whether or not a shuttle could survive crashing into the station's shields at least. You know, in case anyone ever wanted to know.{&1310}\par When I finally got to standing up inside the docking bay proper outside, I started to feel how badly banged up I really was -- which wasn't much, considering I'd just rammed a shuttle into the station. I had more scratches than I could count, especially on my arms from low-crawling out of the wreck, but it was that hole in my stomach that stung the most. I finally got a good look at it now because I'd been in too much of a hurry to back in that airlock. I couldn't tell how deep it was, but a big splots of my shirt was soaked through there with blood and it was hard to tell if it had stopped. Thinking about it suddenly made me feel lightheaded.{&1310}\par I fought with nausea for a few seconds, stumbling further into the docking bay. Somehow, I was alone. A few other shuttles lay motionless at other ends of the bay in various states of preparation but ... no people. The dull sounds of station klaxons were all I heard, echoing dully around the bay.{&1310}\par That pistol I'd stolen from the woman on the shuttle was in one hand, the marine's combat knife in the other. I fumbled to tuck them both in the utility belt of the space suit I was still wearing without a faceplate in place while I staggered off toward an emergency medical station, fighting off the urge to vomit there on the floor. That desperate escape caught up with me in a rush now that adrenaline was dying down and I had to fight off my body just wanting to collapse in a heap on the deck too. It would've been easy to lie down, pass out, and wait for someone else to do the rescuing. It would've been easy ... if I was sure there'd even be a station tomorrow. And if I didn't suddenly feel like something terrible wasn't about to burst into the shuttle bay at any second.{&1310}\par I managed to get to the EMS and pulled out found a few stims for small wounds with a local anesthetic. They'd made us practice some mundane details of field triage back at the academy, but nothing too involved. Thankfully, I didn't think it was too bad, so I just hesitated for a few seconds and tried not to think about what I was doing before stabbing those injectors in my side near the wound. I was on the floor abruptly after that, head feeling stuff so full of nothing that I couldn't have stood up straight. But the pain was melting away.{&1310}\par It took a minute, but my head cleared. God, I hated needles. I pulled myself back up and dug into the medical supplies again for some body gauze and managed to get my stomach wrapped up so I wouldn't just end up bleeding out eventually anyways, even though if it had been that bad it probably would've already killed me by now.{&1310}\par Now ...{&1310}\par Now that I wasn't being chased by flesh-eating monsters, choked to death by vacuum, or hunted by ... by -- \i whoever\i0  it was that wanted me to get to dad -- now ... I finally had time to take stock of the situation.{&1310}\par The station was under attack. Obviously. By pirates or Tau? It only mattered a little. Dad was still alive. \i Okay\i0 . He was trying to find me, so I should find him first. My wrist comm was busted from that guy punching it, though, so I needed a comm linkup. This room might not stay empty or unnoticed forever either and there \i were\i0  boarders on the station. I didn't know how many or what state security was in so I couldn't just stay here. I needed to move, but the thoroughfares were probably just as dangerous as anywhere right now. Maybe more so depending on what this was all about, which I, of course, had no idea about at all.{&1310}\par Oh my god what about Tess?{&1310}\par What had happened to Tess? I had \i no\i0  idea. Dad was alive, sure, but it's not like my best friend was psychokinetic or I had a comm that wasn't broken she could reach me on. The thought that she might be dead suddenly froze me in place and made my blood run cold.{&1310}\par There was a comm station nearby for the bay operators and I practically charged the thing. At first, the terminal wouldn't even come up because it said it was in "Emergency Mode" and access was restricted. But my panicked brain knew enough to hit the emergency communications button to get past that. And then I-{&1310}\par "Shit. \i Shit\i0 !"{&1310}\par I couldn't remember Tess's comm ID number. I'd -- I'd had it on quickcall for so long and I'd dial her up manually since and my comm had \i never\i0  been broken before -- I was so careful about those things -- but I ... I ...{&1310}\par I was starting to tear up, and I had to swipe at my eyes and breathe to get myself back under control. I had to think. Think, think, think -- \i think\i0 ! It had been years but ... I'd memorized it once. If I could just remember ...{&1310}\par But I only got a few numbers in before I wasn't sure of anything being real or just imagined as part of her ID. I pounded my fists into the comms, and the screen fizzled and warped.{&1310}\par \i God damnit, Tess!{&1310}\par If you hadn't hacked your own comm out of the system registry in the first place -- this wouldn't be a fucking problem right now!\i0 {&1310}\par For once, I fucking wished that station security had caught on to her. Or that I hadn't helped keep her fucking secret. Or that her \i fucking\i0  comm was in the \i fucking\i0  registry!{&1310}\par "DAMN IT!"{&1310}\par I slumped against the terminal, not caring at how it suddenly glitched up. I wanted to take the pistol and just shoot the thing like it would make the problem go away. Maybe it would. I considered it.{&1310}\par No.{&1310}\par \i Damn it, Tess, if you're dead I'll\i0  ...{&1310}\par \i I'll\i0  ...{&1310}\par Do nothing? What could I do? What could \i anyone\i0  do?{&1310}\par It was partway through just falling apart there feeling sorry for myself and miserable that I realized that I could just call someone else who had a working comm with Tess on it. Dad wouldn't have had it -- he'd stopped paying attention to who I hung out with years ago. But ... Bertram.{&1310}\par Bertram!{&1310}\par I straighted up and did a search for Bertram. \i He \i0 was in the system. \i He\i0  hadn't tried to covertly take himself out so he could mess around with people's private correspondence or low-level classified files. \i He\i0  had a bar that he needed to keep known and advertised.{&1310}\par I got Bertram's ID out of the registry and called him up on the emergency feed.{&1310}\par I took a long time to go through. \i Too\i0  long. And I had to check the nearest bay doors a few times while I waited, thinking I might have heard something out there over the sounds of the klaxons. It made me pull that pistol back out just in case.{&1310}\par "Evie?"{&1310}\par I whipped back around at that abrupt sound of my name and found myself looking at a familiar, pudgy face.{&1310}\par For a second, I was so relieved and excited and overwhelmed by the actual sight of someone I knew and cared about -- even over an emergency terminal -- that I forget what I was going to say. I felt like I'd been lost in another world for days -- \i week\i0 s -- alone, and without anyone. Lost. And I just stared dumbly at the old man with wide eyes about to tear up and let loose again before I could stop them.{&1310}\par "Evie?" he tried again.{&1310}\par "Y-yes," I managed to choke out, my voice suddenly thick and hoarse in my own ears. "I'm here, Bertram. It's me!"{&1310}\par "You look terrible, Evie, are you alright?"{&1310}\par "Yeah ... I'm -- I'm fine," I lied. I didn't want to talk about myself or where I'd been so I cut right into it first. "Bertram, where's Tess? Is she okay?"{&1310}\par There was the distant echo of small arms fire and my body twisted back around toward the bay behind me instantly. The gun was up and pointing wildly at everything thing that stood out as I quickly scanned the room again. But it wasn't  here. It wasn't on my end.{&1310}\par "Evie!"{&1310}\par I spun right back around.{&1310}\par "Bertram?"{&1310}\par The old man crouched down -- I could only tell by the outline of the scene behind him since he was talking into his wrist comm, not a terminal. And, for the first time, I saw the haggard lines on his face, the ash on his forehead, and trace of blood down one cheek from a gash opened up across his temple. People were yelling in the background and they could have been soldiers. He might have been in his bar, but there was no way to tell from here. I'd just assumed everything was as it always had been when I'd first seen him. I was so very wrong.{&1310}\par "Evie, listen to me," he coughed out, and spat as smoke filled the air and the terminal image. "You've gotta get somewhere safe ... You're father is trying t--"{&1310}\par An explosion.{&1310}\par The station reverberated around Bertram and black smoke poured over his comm, obscuring him from me. He cut off and all I could hear was his wheezing breath somewhere in the smog, then him trying to cough up a lung.{&1310}\par "Bertram--?"{&1310}\par The feed cut out abruptly, and I was left with a blank terminal sporting only the Dreggoran Navy ensignia staring back at me. I hadn't realized it until just then but my face was only centimeters from the screen. And that was all I could do for a few minutes -- stare.{&1310}\par Bertram hadn't said anything about Tess. He'd barely gotten a chance to say anything at \i all\i0  before that blast had cut him off. It had sounded like fighting. Was he even at his bar? Where was Tess? Did she even know that her adopted father could have been dead right now for all I knew?{&1310}\par That thought stopped me cold.{&1310}\par \i Bertram \i0 ...{&1310}\par I had to get to them. I had to \i find\i0  them.{&1310}\par Now.{&1310}\par I had stared at that screen for too long without doing anything. By the time I reached out again it had locked up. And when I tried to load up another emergency feed and find someone else, the lights dimmed in the middle of it until they were gone and I was in darkness.{&1310}\par Panic froze me. For a moment, I was back in that dead research tower with those things all around me. I could \i hear\i0  one of them chewing on a corpse somewhere behind me in the dark and I turned around. Slowly.{&1310}\par The pistol was in my hand, shaking wildly though I couldn't see it. I raised it at that noise. Slowly. So slowly. Somehow, I was sure it was useless and would do nothing. Somehow, I knew I was already dead and pulling the trigger would just make it happen faster.{&1310}\par I couldn't fight. I couldn't run.{&1310}\par I was dead.{&1310}\par Then the lights came back on.{&1310}\par Power returned in a kick and a whirl, bringing the whole bay back to life in a sputtering gasp.{&1310}\par Someone was standing there.{&1310}\par The gun went off on its own. On reflex. My hand fired at that thing before my  brain could even catch up with it.{&1310}\par Except it wasn't one of those monsters crouching there, mindlessly devouring some dead person's body.{&1310}\par It was Mills.{&1310}\par {&1310}\par \cf2\f1 {&1310}\par }{&1310}
