Colors, blood, and metal - not the acrid bile from my stomach. That washed away with the pungent swirl of material and immaterial things from all around me. I wasn't sure if it was taste at all ... but it was something more than seeing, hearing, or just feeling. It \i felt\i0  like tasting.{&1310}\par Tess was helping me up sometime later.{&1310}\par "You're gonna be okay. You're gonna be okay," she kept repeating in my ear like some kind of traumatized mantra. I think it was far more for her benefit than mine, which left me wondering how bad I looked to frighten her out of that stupor she'd been in.{&1310}\par Something had happened to me, and it wasn't normal - I could have laughed if I wasn't so busy trying not to puke my guts up onto the deck. Something \i other\i0  than everything else that had already happened since dad died. I was pretty sure I'd gone insane out there. And maybe I wasn't the only one.{&1310}\par Julian appeared in the control car door with Richter at gunpoint ahead of him, barely wavering and shimmering like ethereal ghosts. They were almost real and tangible again like before. More real than I could hope anything for anyways, just then. The Eluvian man looked like he'd come running, with rifle ready and poised like he'd expected some kind of attack. Richter just look flustered and nervous. Julian shoved him inside before sweeping the tiny cabin like some Dreggoran commando from some vid. When he was satisfied, he settled on us.{&1310}\par "What happened?"{&1310}\par "I don't know - she just ... just fell over!" Tess cried back at him.{&1310}\par She must have yelled, and I must have hit the deck. I still wasn't sure just what had happened myself, but my head only felt like it was swimming a little less than it was before. And it hurt from where I must have smacked the metal plating. {&1310}\par "Tram sickness," Julian started to say as he got down in front of me, slinging his rifle again. I was still hovering precariously above the deck and he had to snatch my chin with one of his rough, old gloves to get me to look at him. And maybe he wasn't so sure about what had happened when he finally did, because he frowned at what he saw there.{&1310}\par "\i What\i0 ?" Tess grabbed at his arm angrily when he didn't bother to say anything else.{&1310}\par He glanced at her, briefly. Then back at me. He was staring at my eyes, and I got a good, sickeningly thorough look at his while I tried to swallow back bile and shivering parallels. I don't think I'd ever seen him so put off since we'd met him.{&1310}\par I think that scared me more than the actual thing. Cold fear crept in where a muted panic had tried to seize me before, and I had a hard time not letting my stomach burst again. Julian just let go and stood straight up. He gave each of us another quick look.{&1310}\par "\i What\i0 ?" Tess demanded again, her voice cracking.{&1310}\par Julian turned away, though - \i something\i0  swimming around inside his head. He didn't say anything more for a while.{&1310}\par I started to feel a little bit better after a couple more minutes, but I wasn't even sure if the whole episode was something that could pass by the time Tess started helping me back into a seat. Maybe I'd be stuck seeing between those lines of reality forever. Maybe. I tried not to think about it because it only made the urge to throw up ten times worse.{&1310}\par With nothing but the hum of the train as it sped along, things got quiet and awkward inside the cabin after that. I think that security officer felt the most so; he blended back into the background of the consoles and swiped at his sweaty brow. He'd gotten out of that town alive, which was a lot more than most of the people back there could say. Not that they could say anything anymore. But there was no guarantee that Julian would let him make it all the way to wherever we were going alive. He didn't have a good track record with anyone other than Tess and me.{&1310}\par "How many will they send to check the cargo when we get to port?"{&1310}\par I guess the two men had been thinking the same thing as me. Richter jumped at that sudden question from the Eluvian when he realized it was directed at him.{&1310}\par "Wh-what?" he managed, and swallowed thickly.{&1310}\par "How many?" Julian repeated. "And how well armed?"{&1310}\par The security officer just seemed confused by that. His mouth bobbed up and down a few times before Julian shifted the pistol back into his hand. That settled the other man, and he swallowed one more time.{&1310}\par "Eishaffen, you m-mean?" he stammered out. "I don't know - a foreman comes down and usually goes over the manifest with Frieder." His accent wasn't as bad as most of the men back at the bar.{&1310}\par "Security?"{&1310}\par "You mean aside from us?" He shook his head. "I guess a couple guys, just 'cause the public terminals can get a bit rough some days. Why?"{&1310}\par "How long until we get there?" Julian pointed his pistol at the console behind the other man. Richter frowned, then turned around to take a look at it.{&1310}\par "I guess, uhhh ..."{&1310}\par He never got a chance to finish, though. Julian had closed to space between them in the car before anyone knew what was happening, and cracked him over the skull hard enough to knock him out.

Then listened for a few, long seconds.{&1310}\par I could hear the steady hum of the cars zipping along through the tunnel, rattling only ever so slightly in their segmented joints. They shifted in winding patterns in front of us, and it felt like looking down the long belly of a snake.{&1310}\par There was a stabbing pain in my eyes and I got a flash of that sinewy corridor in a million different positions at once to the screeching howl of ripped metal in my ears. It doubled me over again, but Julian and Tess didn't see.{&1310}\par "Do you think he'll," Tess started, "he can't do anything ... right? I mean, you took away his gun."{&1310}\par "He still has the engineer's passkey."{&1310}\par "What's he gonna do with that?" she demanded, casting a glance back over her shoulder into the cabin behind. He would have had to go through us.{&1310}\par "There's another control car at the other end."{&1310}\par Except for that.{&1310}\par "Oh," she whispered back. "So, uh, why are we just standing here then."{&1310}\par "Because," Julian started, still scanning the passage with his rifle, "We were still a way down from the other car. And I don't hear any footsteps."{&1310}\par I think Tess got his meaning then. I did. And I could already imagine that security officer in his tattered uniform hiding in the dark waiting to pounce. I wondered if he could take Julian down in a straight-up fight. From everything I'd seen so far, I didn't think so. I guess I was still worried for some reason, though.{&1310}\par "Stay back," he told us both then, eyes never leaving the corridor, " and keep quiet."{&1310}\par He started creeping forward, and Tess and I trailed behind. And when Julian noticed us following, he snapped, "I said stay \i there\i0 . Don't let anyone back this way. Shoot them if it's not me."{&1310}\par "I thought anyone included you."{&1310}\par Julian gave Tess a dark look. For some reason, she didn't look much like she was joking, though. The Eluvian finally grabbed my hands and shoved the rifle he took from Richter into them.{&1310}\par "Do it," he ordered me flatly, ignoring Tess. Then he turned back around and started making his way carefully down the central corridor between the freight compartments.{&1310}\par I'd never thought that there might have been anyone else hiding on that train when we got on, but I did wonder then as I felt the gulf grow between us and Julian. With each cautious, wary step, I could see someone pouncing out of the shadows on him to bludgeon our last bulwark to death. Or maybe a well-placed shot down the cover of the dark taking him down cleanly. I left the rifle in my hands, held it like I'd seen him hold it, and imagined squeezing the trigger like he would. Tess just stood there without even pulling her pistol out.\cf2\f2 {&1310}\par }{&1310}

Not that I didn't have more important things to worry about just then.{&1310}\par "I meant the other one."{&1310}\par "Good question," was all Julian said. And Tess' eyes bugged out.{&1310}\par "What's \i that \i0 supposed to mean?"{&1310}\par He threw a hand up to quiet us both. Then listened for a few, long seconds.{&1310}\par I could hear the steady hum of the cars zipping along through the tunnel, rattling only ever so slightly in their segmented joints. They shifted in winding patterns in front of us, and it felt like looking down the long belly of a snake.{&1310}\par There was a stabbing pain in my eyes and I got a flash of that sinewy corridor in a million different positions at once to the screeching howl of ripped metal in my ears. It doubled me over again, but Julian and Tess didn't see.{&1310}\par "Do you think he'll," Tess started, "he can't do anything ... right? I mean, you took away his gun."{&1310}\par "He still has the engineer's passkey."{&1310}\par "What's he gonna do with that?" she demanded, casting a glance back over her shoulder into the cabin behind. He would have had to go through us.{&1310}\par "There's another control car at the other end."{&1310}\par Except for that.{&1310}\par "Oh," she whispered back. "So, uh, why are we just standing here then."{&1310}\par "Because," Julian started, still scanning the passage with his rifle, "We were still a way down from the other car. And I don't hear any footsteps."{&1310}\par I think Tess got his meaning then. I did. And I could already imagine that security officer in his tattered uniform hiding in the dark waiting to pounce. I wondered if he could take Julian down in a straight-up fight. From everything I'd seen so far, I didn't think so. I guess I was still worried for some reason, though.{&1310}\par "Stay back," he told us both then, eyes never leaving the corridor, " and keep quiet."{&1310}\par He started creeping forward, and Tess and I trailed behind. And when Julian noticed us following, he snapped, "I said stay \i there\i0 . Don't let anyone back this way. Shoot them if it's not me."{&1310}\par "I thought anyone included you."{&1310}\par Julian gave Tess a dark look. For some reason, she didn't look much like she was joking, though. The Eluvian finally grabbed my hands and shoved the rifle he took from Richter into them.{&1310}\par "Do it," he ordered me flatly, ignoring Tess. Then he turned back around and started making his way carefully down the central corridor between the freight compartments.{&1310}\par I'd never thought that there might have been anyone else hiding on that train when we got on, but I did wonder then as I felt the gulf grow between us and Julian. With each cautious, wary step, I could see someone pouncing out of the shadows on him to bludgeon our last bulwark to death. Or maybe a well-placed shot down the cover of the dark taking him down cleanly. I left the rifle in my hands, held it like I'd seen him hold it, and imagined squeezing the trigger like he would. Tess just stood there without even pulling her pistol out.\cf2\f2 {&1310}\par }{&1310}

It \i felt\i0  like tasting.{&1310}\par Tess was helping me up sometime later.{&1310}\par "You're gonna be okay. You're gonna be okay," she kept repeating in my ear like some kind of traumatized mantra.

Something \i other\i0  than everything else that had already happened since dad died. I was pretty sure I'd gone insane out there.

Not wavering or shimmering so much like a ghost, but real and tangible enough like before. As real as I could hope anything was anyways, just then. He looked like he'd come running, with rifle ready and poised like we might be under attack. Richter just look flustered and nervous. Julian shoved him inside before clearing the tiny cabin like a Dreggoran commando from some vid. Then he settled on us.{&1310}\par "What happened?"{&1310}\par "I don't know - she just fell over!" Tess cried back at him.{&1310}\par She must have yelled for him, and I must have hit the deck. I still wasn't sure just what happened myself, but my head didn't feel like it was swimming as much as before. It just hurt from when I must have smacked the metal plating. {&1310}\par "Tram sickness," Julian started to say as he got down in front of me, slinging his rifle again. He took my face by the chin and made me look at him. Maybe he wasn't so sure about that anymore, because he frowned at what he saw there.{&1310}\par "\i What\i0 ?" Tess grabbed at his arm angrily when he didn't bother to say anything else.{&1310}\par He glanced at her, briefly. Then back at me. He was staring at my eyes. I don't think I'd ever seen him so put off since we'd met him.{&1310}\par Whatever it was, I could feel the last of it subsiding as Julian just let go and stood straight up again. He gave each of us another quick look.{&1310}\par "\i What\i0 ?" Tess demanded again, her voice cracking.{&1310}\par Julian just turned around, though - \i something\i0  swimming around inside his head. He didn't say anything more for a few seconds. Then he abruptly looked up.{&1310}\par The rifle was back up in his hands. He was suddenly that man guiding us through the torn apart bar again, expecting death to come slicing out of the dark. He still had Richter's rifle.{&1310}\par "Get up," he ordered us of a sudden, canting his head. Tess helped me to my feet, and we joined him at the door.{&1310}\par "What did you do with that other guy?" Tess asked.{&1310}\par "We threw him in one of the empty storage cars for now," he told her without looking away from the hall.

He didn't say anything more for a while, and things got quiet and awkward inside the cabin. I think that security officer felt the most so; he blended back into the background of the consoles and swiped at his sweaty brow. Tess helped me back into a seat and took the one beside me.{&1310}\par "How many will they send to check the cargo when we get to port?"{&1310}\par Richter nearly seemed to jump at that sudden question from the Eluvian when he realized it was directed at him.{&1310}\par "Wh-what?" he managed, and swallowed thickly.{&1310}\par "How many?" Julian repeated. "And how well armed?"{&1310}\par The security officer just seemed confused by that. His mouth bobbed up and down a few times before Julian shifted the pistol back into his hand and the other man finally swallowed again.{&1310}\par "Eishaffen, you m-mean?" he stammered out. "I don't know - a foreman comes down and usually goes over the manifest with Frieder." His accent wasn't as bad as most of the men back at the bar.{&1310}\par "Security?"{&1310}\par "You mean aside from us?" He shook his head. "I guess a couple guys, just 'cause the public terminals can get a bit rough some days. Why?"{&1310}\par "How long until we get there?" Julian pointed his pistol at the console behind the other man. Richter frowned, then turned around to take a look at it.{&1310}\par "I guess, uhhh ..."{&1310}\par He never got a chance to finish, though. Julian had closed to space between them in the car before anyone knew what was happening, and cracked him over the skull hard enough to knock him out. He slumped down into the panel.\cf2\f2 {&1310}\par }{&1310}
