The pod wasn't far from where the shuttle had crashed, but still I broke out in an anxious fit thinking about something happening to Ev while I was gone.

It was harder to think of him being dead, remembering the indomitable stares, steely-eyed determination, and resolute steadfastness that he had approached everything with all the years I had known him. He was titanic, and he was scary. Most of all, he always knew just what to do, and I really didn't want to have to make those kinds of decisions right now.

My knuckles were white above it where the mess had smeared and dried from pulling Ev out. There was too much in there for the old man. I knew that. There was no way he could have been alive. I knew that too. I had seen him. I had seen him dead, and staring.{&1310}\par Hadn't I?{&1310}\par Something moved.{&1310}\par My eyes snapped up, but there was nothing there.

And it led in the other direction. Into the woods.{&1310}\par I followed that red-and-black mess with my eyes up to the treeline. It got dark after that, under the trees - hidden away from the daylight. I couldn't see anything further than a few dozen meters, but the trail didn't stop there.{&1310}\par My tongue was thick in my throat.{&1310}\par "D ... Doctor Weir?" I called out.{&1310}\par Funny.
