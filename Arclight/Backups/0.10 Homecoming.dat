If there was ever going to be a moment more surreally terrifying than that one where I first saw the \i Soyorov\i0  and finally started to realize, really, just how much of my life I had signed away to someone else, it was this one. Looking at home again with stranger's eyes from the outside. The Academy and training was the first time I had ever left. For over twenty years, I didn't know anything else except through vids, and that barely counted, really. And now I felt like I didn't even belong out here anymore.{&1310}\par Even Miller looked perturbed by the whole thing coming true now. Standing there with his rucksack full of inconsequential personal belongings and spare clothes from the barracks, tank-juice-matted black hair and a faraway attitude. I don't think he felt any more at home now than I did. Maybe that was part of the point. We come home after so long and so much change and feel like we don't belong anymore, like the Navy is our only real home and family now. Then we go back to them and never feel like leaving because we can't stand feeling adrift and alone.{&1310}\par Maybe surviving that pirate ambush wasn't the biggest mercy we could have suffered along the way.{&1310}\par Miller's hand gradually wilted as he realized how intimidating the sight of Riftwatch Station really was. It drooped back down to his side. I could understand him right then. I felt slowly overwhelmed on so many levels that it left me quietly paralyzed and just staring out at the station as it quickly got closer and closer to us inside the frigate. The bright cloud tendrils of the Rift loomed large and unfeeling behind, grasping out into space.{&1310}\par "Attention, passengers we took on at Heat Station. We have arrived at your destination. Prepare to disembark from the ship."{&1310}\par The captain's voice came on briefly and succinctly and was just as quickly gone again. I'd heard that they would have to debrief in port for a day or so due to the attack since it was standard procedure. I let go of that view of the Rift and went to shoulder my own pack. Miller cleared his throat beside me.{&1310}\par "What, uh ... so what are you going to do?"{&1310}\par I froze, bent over with the straps half on my back. What was \i I\i0  going to do? I guess I hadn't really thought about it much. I mean, I'd thought a whole lot around it -- how things would look and feel, how people I'd known for years and left behind would react, how \i I\i0  would react to them -- but I hadn't really thought about how it would start. How I would get off the ship and what I would do first. I had no idea.{&1310}\par "I don't know. Pass out for the next two weeks?"{&1310}\par \i Real\i0  sleep. In a \i real\i0  bed. None of that tank-induced, coma-like, nightmare and headache-fueled purgatory. Yeah. That sounded fucking wonderful.{&1310}\par He barked another of those unexpected, caught-off-guard laughs, and shook his head.{&1310}\par "I guess I could understand that."{&1310}\par You'd think two future leaders of the Grand Admirals' finest would know better or have some sort of plan for what they would do next at any given moment. We were supposed to be able to decide and move without hesitation. Hesitation is weakness, and weakness is fatal. Me, at least -- I had an excuse. All that was pretty much behind me, I was exhausted, and I sucked at all of it anyways. Months and months surrounded on every side by all that soldierly super-enthusiasm and now it just felt like a shell of ice melting around me as soon as I'd come back out into the sun. {&1310}\par \i What's your excuse, Mills\i0 ?\i  {&1310}\par \i0 Or maybe that was unfair and he was just as bad off as me. Maybe I looked like I kept it that together on the outside too. Maybe Morisant and Commander Delacroix and all of them \i couldn't\i0  see me coming apart at the seams under all that pressure. {&1310}\par Maybe.{&1310}\par "Come on -- seeing this coming the past couple weeks and you really \i don't\i0  have anything planned for as soon as you get off this ship?" I said as we lined up with the rest of the trainees at the frigate's airlock, getting ready to disembark as it came in for its final approach.{&1310}\par He shook his head. "Too much going on to think about it. All the instructors yelling in my face, Lieutenant Morisant hovering around the whole time ... you know ..."{&1310}\par I laughed a little in my throat, and bobbed my head. I guess I did know. He took some encouragement from that because the small, shy smile on his reddening face blossomed into an abashed, but pleasant, grin showing his teeth.{&1310}\par "My aunt should be waiting for me," he added like a quiet afterthought. And then we felt the docking clamps catch the ship with a gentle rock of the deck. The airlock opened and we were staring down the gangplank against from the opposite end this time. Air wooshed out at us, acclimating and adjusting the atmosphere for our arrival. It suddenly tasted twice as fresh in my lungs, but that nervous sense of dread drowned it out. Short, staccato breaths high in my chest were about all I could manage while that petty officer helped ferry our gang of tank-wet boots down toward the station. And everything felt so real and surreal all at once that it made my hands twitch with clammy sweat on the straps of my pack.{&1310}\par I had to resist the urge to stumble back inside the frigate and fumble some excuse out for why I couldn't possibly go home yet -- wasn't ready. My brain raced ahead and started imagining the conversation -- all the reasons I could give to just keep me off that station. Home. I tried to distract it by focusing on the Rift just outside the steelglass as we walked. It let my feet trudge along automatically until it was too late to turn around.{&1310}\par But that didn't stop me from seeing myself spin back and claw my way away from the other side. Like it would be so easy ... if I would just let myself.{&1310}\par Those weird little desperate daydream fantasy flitted through my head -- bolts of fear trying to blast through six months of hardened, trained discipline. I could feel it threaten to buckle under the sickening weight of all that nervousness. The me that had left this station before would have cracked and bolted. The me that had finally come back just barely managed to keep it together and moving.{&1310}\par Then we were through.{&1310}\par I heard voices over the hollow sound of my own heart beating inside my ears. Family members ahead inside the docking bay past the port authority outside the airlock. Some of the others had already cleared check-in and were rushing out and jumping excitedly at faces they hadn't seen in half a year. A mother and sister hugging a son and brother. A dad shaking his son's hand with a heavy look of pride and relief on his face. Even Mills. Someone shouted out and it took my overwhelmed brain a second to connect it to him after he threw a hand up and waved excitedly back. Quincy. I don't think I remembered anyone ever calling him that back at the academy. You were always just a last name. Everyone was.{&1310}\par Mills chattered excitedly through check-in and then promptly forgot about me once he was through and ran off. It was like watching a lifeline snatched back from right in front of me, even though I had no reason to feel like he owed me any solidarity. Just a trip back home. It's not like we'd been friends or anything.{&1310}\par And just like that, I was out and alone in the middle of all this enthusiastic homecoming. I stopped in place. I didn't want to look around and see what was waiting for me. Somehow, the thought of seeing it was more frightening than anything else that had happened over the past six months. More frightening than the pirate attack or Commander Delacroix.{&1310}\par I was here, and there was no going back. My shell of discipline wavered and then finally cracked wide open while I stood there at the point of no return. More desperate, deranged fantasies of retreat and escape back into the frigate filled my head. I tried to ignore them, but that left me painfully aware of how lonely and exposed I was just standing there with one awkward hand dangling from a strap on my rucksack. I didn't know what to do with the other one.{&1310}\par I stared down at it, distracting myself and trying not to think about how dumb I probably looked right now. When did my palms get so callused?{&1310}\par \i That's a stupid thing to think. I know exactly how.\i0 {&1310}\par \i When\i0 . Not \i how\i0 . When. My mind started running away back through the days, thinking about each one in reverse and how I might have noticed those calluses thickening.{&1310}\par The staff fighting, mostly. That was it. PT, pullups, and rope-climbing too.{&1310}\par \i What kind of idiot sits here thinking about calluses while everyone else is running around so excited to see their friends and family against after so long.\i0 {&1310}\par Me, I guess. I should have been excited. Why wasn't I excited? The hairs on my skin stood up all over like I was waiting for some kind of sudden attack.{&1310}\par \i Just look up. I can't stand just stand here for the next two weeks.{&1310}\par \i0 Maybe no one had noticed yet.{&1310}\par \i They will soon\i0 .{&1310}\par Okay ... In ten.{&1310}\par \i Ten ... nine ... eight ... sev-\i0 {&1310}\par Someone nearly knocked me over from behind -- one of the beefy recruits who was hurriedly fastening on his service beret and practically running past. "Sorry," he threw back at me without even looking as he charged a tiny woman who must have been his mother waiting there on the platform. I followed after him on reflex, startled out of myself and feeling clumsy, unsettled, and defensive. Then I saw someone standing at the edge of the docking bay.{&1310}\par "Ev?"{&1310}\par I didn't recognize her at first. I'm not even sure I did after a couple seconds more of just dumbfounded staring since there was something so off and disconcerting about her in the flesh. After all this time, even with the holocalls, it just seemed too vibrant and real by comparison. Like I'd been gone for years rather than just a few months.{&1310}\par "Ev?" she repeated herself and took a step forward. "Oh my god, it \i is\i0  you." And breathed out an incredulous laugh. Then she was flying at me and all of that fear, anxiety, and those feelings of alienation from training so suddenly were overwhelmed in an isntant as she tackled me in a hug so violently enthusiastic and genuine that I fell back off my feet and hit the floor.{&1310}\par Tess picked herself back up and laughed down at me. I glanced around, but no one in particular even seemed to notice me getting bowled over. No one had even noticed me just standing there. Had it only been a few seconds? {&1310}\par The rest of them were all just happy to be home. Everyone, all around me. It was a happy reunion. They were happy to be home.{&1310}\par  ... \i I\i0  was happy to be home.{&1310}\par I realized that slowly, climbing back up from the floor. It crept up and overwhelmed me and dashed most of those other feelings aside. I found an oasis of familiarity amidst the desert outside my sheltered comfort zone and she was smiling to see me again.  She'd been my best friend for pretty much my whole life, and that confidence came back -- now I wasn't alone. And now I could decide that I really was happy to be here. {&1310}\par "Come on," she started pulling me away, "let's get outta here." She was giggly and giddy and so bright about it that I suddenly was too. As we dashed away from the docking bay homecoming, I wasn't a cadet or a Psycho or a soldier or anything anymore. For the first time in a lifetime, I was just me again. And I was happy.\cf2\f1\fs20 {&1310}\par }{&1310}

My brain raced ahead and started imagining the conversation -- all the reasons I could give to just keep me off that station. Home. I tried to distract it by focusing on the Rift just outside the steelglass as we walked. It let my feet trudge along automatically until it was too late to turn around.{&1310}\par But that didn't stop me from seeing myself spin back and claw my way away from the other side. Like it would be so easy ... if I would just let myself.{&1310}\par Those weird little desperate daydream fantasy flitted through my head -- bolts of fear trying to blast through six months of hardened, trained discipline. I could feel it threaten to buckle under the sickening weight of all that nervousness. The me that had left this station before would have cracked and bolted. The me that had finally come back just barely managed to keep it together and moving.{&1310}\par Then we were through.{&1310}\par I heard voices over the hollow sound of my own heart beating inside my ears. Family members ahead inside the docking bay past the port authority outside the airlock. Some of the others had already cleared check-in and were rushing out and jumping excitedly at faces they hadn't seen in half a year. A mother and sister hugging a son and brother. A dad shaking his son's hand with a heavy look of pride and relief on his face. Even Mills. Someone shouted out and it took my overwhelmed brain a second to connect it to him after he threw a hand up and waved excitedly back. Quincy. I don't think I remembered anyone ever calling him that back at the academy. You were always just a last name. Everyone was.{&1310}\par Mills chattered excitedly through check-in and then promptly forgot about me once he was through and ran off. It was like watching a lifeline snatched back from right in front of me, even though I had no reason to feel like he owed me any solidarity. Just a trip back home. It's not like we'd been friends or anything.{&1310}\par And just like that, I was out and alone in the middle of all this enthusiastic homecoming. I stopped in place. I didn't want to look around and see what was waiting for me. Somehow, the thought of seeing it was more frightening than anything else that had happened over the past six months. More frightening than the pirate attack or Commander Delacroix.{&1310}\par I was here, and there was no going back. My shell of discipline wavered and then finally cracked wide open while I stood there at the point of no return. More desperate, deranged fantasies of retreat and escape back into the frigate filled my head. I tried to ignore them, but that left me painfully aware of how lonely and exposed I was just standing there with one awkward hand dangling from a strap on my rucksack. I didn't know what to do with the other one.{&1310}\par I stared down at it, distracting myself and trying not to think about how dumb I probably looked right now. When did my palms get so callused?{&1310}\par \i That's a stupid thing to think. I know exactly how.\i0 {&1310}\par \i When\i0 . Not \i how\i0 . When. My mind started running away back through the days, thinking about each one in reverse and how I might have noticed those calluses thickening.{&1310}\par The staff fighting, mostly. That was it. PT, pullups, and rope-climbing too.{&1310}\par \i What kind of idiot sits here thinking about calluses while everyone else is running around so excited to see their friends and family against after so long.\i0 {&1310}\par Me, I guess. I should have been excited. Why wasn't I excited? The hairs on my skin stood up all over like I was waiting for some kind of sudden attack.{&1310}\par \i Just look up. I can't stand just stand here for the next two weeks.{&1310}\par \i0 Maybe no one had noticed yet.{&1310}\par \i They will soon\i0 .{&1310}\par Okay ... In ten.{&1310}\par \i Ten ... nine ... eight ... sev-\i0 {&1310}\par Someone nearly knocked me over from behind -- one of the beefy recruits who was hurriedly fastening on his service beret and practically running past. "Sorry," he threw back at me without even looking as he charged a tiny woman who must have been his mother waiting there on the platform. I followed after him on reflex, startled out of myself and feeling clumsy, unsettled, and defensive. Then I saw someone standing at the edge of the docking bay.{&1310}\par "Ev?"{&1310}\par I didn't recognize her at first. I'm not even sure I did after a couple seconds more of just dumbfounded staring since there was something so off and disconcerting about her in the flesh. After all this time, even with the holocalls, it just seemed too vibrant and real by comparison. Like I'd been gone for years rather than just a few months.{&1310}\par "Ev?" she repeated herself and took a step forward. "Oh my god, it \i is\i0  you." And breathed out an incredulous laugh. Then she was flying at me and all of that fear, anxiety, and those feelings of alienation from training so suddenly were overwhelmed in an isntant as she tackled me in a hug so violently enthusiastic and genuine that I fell back off my feet and hit the floor.{&1310}\par Tess picked herself back up and laughed down at me. I glanced around, but no one in particular even seemed to notice me getting bowled over. No one had even noticed me just standing there. Had it only been a few seconds? {&1310}\par The rest of them were all just happy to be home. Everyone, all around me. It was a happy reunion. They were happy to be home.{&1310}\par  ... \i I\i0  was happy to be home.{&1310}\par I realized that slowly, climbing back up from the floor. It crept up and overwhelmed me and dashed most of those other feelings aside. I found an oasis of familiarity amidst the desert outside my sheltered comfort zone and she was smiling to see me again.  She'd been my best friend for pretty much my whole life, and that confidence came back -- now I wasn't alone. And now I could decide that I really was happy to be here. {&1310}\par "Come on," she started pulling me away, "let's get outta here." She was giggly and giddy and so bright about it that I suddenly was too. As we dashed away from the docking bay homecoming, I wasn't a cadet or a Psycho or a soldier or anything anymore. For the first time in a lifetime, I was just me again. And I was happy.\cf2\f1\fs20 {&1310}\par }{&1310}
