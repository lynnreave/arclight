It was hard not to, floating listlessly and hidden beneath that surface where the dead woman had been torn apart right in front of me. Just like I was any other corpse onboard the station right then. Maybe they wouldn't find me. I almost felt safe there in the dark. Just another corpse.{&1310}\par Like Tess.{&1310}\par I winced, and my eyes were puffy, and red. That thought in my head kept coming back when it shouldn't have -- so insistent that I could \i see\i0  her dead, mangled body when I closed my eyes. Dad's too. And Bertram's. {&1310}\par For all I knew that dead woman in chunks on top of me was all that was left of my best friend. What would she even be doing here? Who knew -- what was \i I\i0  even doing here? I could have checked, but I was too scared too even move. Besides, maybe she couldn't really be dead if I never saw the body.{&1310}\par I laid there too long. {&1310}\par Because, eventually, I felt ... {&1310}\par \i It\i0 .{&1310}\par A dull pain in the front of my head. It was so small at first I didn't even notice it with all the fear-born adrenaline still burning away inside my veins. Then it got stronger. A lot stronger. Like a rising tide of searing-hot, blistering pain. All sound died off in first one ear, then the other. White noise seethed out to replace it. I winced and cried out soundlessly as the roar grew louder, and louder, and louder. {&1310}\par And louder.{&1310}\par ... \i can't\i0  ...{&1310}\par ... \i think\i0  ...!{&1310}\par --\b VELYN\b0 --{&1310}\par Something new grated inside my skull. Like a sound, except I wasn't hearing it with my ears. Each syllable ripped at my brain like it was being burned right into the gray matter.{&1310}\par \b --EVEL\b0 --\b WHERE\b0 --\b RE\b0  \b YOU\b0 --{&1310}\par My teeth were clenched so tight that they should have cracked and split. My back arched and tried to snap. And I couldn't even notice, or care. That voice just kept on stabbing at the insides of my skull.{&1310}\par \b --LOOK AROU\b0 --{&1310}\par --\b KNOW IT HUR\b0 --{&1310}\par --\b NT BREAK CONTACT\b0 --{&1310}\par \i yes oh my god please fucking god yes break contact please!\i0 {&1310}\par \b --LOOK AROUND--{&1310}\par \b0 My skull was too wired to move. I'd squeezed my eyes shut without even realizing it because I couldn't process anything else coming into or out of my brain. Now they opened. I'd have done anything if it would have made that blind, molten agony inside my head go away. \i Anything\i0  ...{&1310}\par I couldn't move at all, though. My body was spasming and convulsing all over like I was having a seizure. Maybe I was. I wondered if those things would hear me shaking there and come b-{&1310}\par That pain doubled. And doubled. And doubled.{&1310}\par I must have blacked out because when I came back, my body had managed to turn my neck. I don't know how. I could barely even register what I was seeing. That white-hot slicing inside my skull had died back down to barely lethal levels again. My mouth was wide open screaming, but no sound would come out. If it ever had, I would probably be dead soon anyways.{&1310}\par --\b COME TO ME\b0 --{&1310}\par Suddenly, it stopped. And so did my brain.{&1310}\par {&1310}\par \pard\sl480\slmult1\qc *\tab *\tab *{&1310}\par {&1310}\par \pard\fi720\sl480\slmult1 My hand hung in the air while I just stood there, staring at it as it shook ever so slightly with nervous energy like it was the most fascinating thing on the station. It wasn't. It really wasn't. I squinted and concentrated and willed it to stop, the whimsical thought in my head that here -- \i here\i0  I would suddenly discover some latent ability that'd been buried inside me all along, in the dumbest way imaginable. Right here on Dr. Nolan Weir's doorstep.{&1310}\par I was stalling. {&1310}\par Mostly.{&1310}\par Tess had left me about twenty minutes ago and it had taken me a full ten to get here. Because I dragged my feet. Because I let every little thing and person along the way slow me down. And I let each wayward, nonsensical thought distract me for another ten minutes while I stood there, perched on the threshold in a strange mixture of trepidation and excitement. I hadn't spoken to dad in six months.{&1310}\par A flash of anger. It was enough to let me steel myself and set my jaw like I'd buzz his quarters this time. I knew he was there. I'd checked his scheduled office hours, and he always took them at home where he could keep working. In private. He'd been too busy to see me off and he'd probably been too busy again to see me back, but he \i wasn't\i0  going to be too busy to talk to his own daughter before she shipped off to get eaten alive by some creepy psycho commander on a military base in the middle of nowhere where-{&1310}\par What if he knew? What if he already knew how screwed I was? How terrible my performance was? That the daughter of one of the most powerful and respected psychokinetics in the sector -- who knew, maybe even the entire \i system\i0  -- didn't have any ability at all? That she was mundane, defective -- just \i normal\i0 . What if he already knew all that? He had connections still -- more so now that he was retired it always seemed like to me.{&1310}\par I slumped and my hand fell again. For the third time. And I spent the next five minutes convincing myself that the reason he had never bothered leaving me any messages at all was because he had snooped in on the reports and seen just how horrible they'd been and been ashamed. Maybe even embarassed. Maybe even pretended I didn't exist for a while so it wouldn't get back on him that I'd failed.{&1310}\par My one big chance to prove something ... I don't even know what. That I was worth something too? That no one would have to put us together and take pity on me? That some of that familial talent had rubbed off from the gene pool and wasn't just going to disappear forever?{&1310}\par Maybe.{&1310}\par It would have helped if he'd at least have-{&1310}\par "W-Weir?"{&1310}\par I jumped in surprise. I almost fell over too as I spun back around.{&1310}\par "He's not ..." {&1310}\par \i Home\i0 , I started to say -- wait, why was I lying? -- but stopped, when I saw who it was.{&1310}\par Miller had frozen mid-stride on his way down the corridor behind and was gaping at me sideways. Dressed in civvies and looking much more cleaned up from how we'd fallen out of the G-tubes that morning on the frigate.{&1310}\par "What are you, ah, doing over here, Weir," he asked across the way at me. A couple marines practically ran him over and he bounced out of the way in my direction. The shock of it suddenly ripped me out of that mental fugue and made me realize just what I'd been doing for the past fifteen minutes. Just \i standing\i0  there ... staring at a door. Looking like an idiot.{&1310}\par He reached my side of the thoroughfare ahead of the evening transit trying to run him down and cocked his head at me. "Well?"{&1310}\par "I, uh ..." I threw a hand back toward the door that I'd been standing in front of that whole time and just stared for a few more seconds. Then I shook my head. "I was going to see my dad."{&1310}\par "Oh, oh yeah?" he said with a laugh, giving me this awkward, lopsided grin with his boot-haggard but still kind of softly boyish-looking face. "Who's that? I mean, if you don't mind me just-"{&1310}\par He looked past me toward the door as I opened my mouth to answer. And then I didn't have to because he was suddenly gaping. {&1310}\par "Wow." He slipped past me to get a closer look. Like he'd read it wrong or just couldn't believe it at first glance. Maybe both. "You're father is \i that\i0  Weir?" he asked, incredulous for a moment. "\i Admiral\i0  Weir?"{&1310}\par "He's retired, but yeah," I shrugged without knowing what else to say. "I mean I guess so ..."{&1310}\par "Wow," was all Mills could say, though, not really hearing. Instead, he took a deep breath with a stunned look still on his face. He laughed, shaking his head. "That's so crazy, Weir. I wouldn't have guessed."{&1310}\par "It's not like there are a lot of Weirs on the station ..." I said. In fact, I couldn't think of any other one. "And you don't have to call me that here. You know?" I wasn't a boot psycho here anymore. I wasn't going to \i be\i0  a boot psycho anymore.{&1310}\par "Yeah, but I never would have guess that you were \i his\i0 - oh, uh ... sorry. I didn't mean it like that. Really."{&1310}\par He must have seen the look on my face, and I realized that I had one as soon as he said that. So much for discipline.{&1310}\par "So, um, Evelyn then?" he asked, clearing his throat.{&1310}\par "Yeah." I shrugged again. "Why not."{&1310}\par Being called by my last name reminded me of the Academy and dad both. The instructors always called you by last name, chewing up and spitting the word out like it was synonymous with shit. The other recruits just followed suit. Well, without being so cruel about it. And it was his name more than mine besides. His reputation, not mine. I hadn't earned it yet, and I probably never would.{&1310}\par "So you were going to see your dad for the first time since you got back?" He continued, and I just shrugged at him for a third time. Taking full advantage of the fact I could answer a question from someone like that again, I guess. Or something. "Sorry," Mills apologized, and it sounded earnest. "I didn't mean to get in the middle of that."{&1310}\par "It's okay," I offered quickly. \i Too\i0  quickly.{&1310}\par "I mean, that's gotta be intense. He's one of the top guys in the Psychokinetic Research division, and on the Board, right? Christ," Mills put a palm to his head and shook it, "he's probably one of the most powerful, natural psychokinetics on the entire station!"{&1310}\par "Yeah ..."{&1310}\par "I can't believe I never even thought about it the whole time," he kept on to himself in that bewildered tone. "Six months and I never even bothered to ... just --wow ..."{&1310}\par I stood there while he thought about how crazy that was a little longer, not sure what to do with my hands now that I wasn't alone anymore and I was painfully aware of it. Mills' whole suddenly being here had derailed me completely -- not that I'd really been going much of anywhere or even had an overall plan, but I was going to get around to something. Eventually. And I couldn't quite decide if I hated him for it or simply felt relieved to be distracted a little while longer.{&1310}\par And I wondered how much longer it would take him to put together that the only child of Dr. Nolan Weir, with all his accolades and authority and legacy of respect -- was completely, \i utterly\i0  without any manifested psychokinetic abilities. Unlike some people, Mills had actually witnessed that failure first hand. Again and again.{&1310}\par "Would you," he started abruptly out of that incredulous thought flow, and I broke in with a "Hmm?" before he could even finish. Too fast again. But he thought better of whatever he was going to say, found the right words, and then started again.{&1310}\par \i Here it comes\i0 .{&1310}\par I sighed for the fourth time. Deep, and desolate.{&1310}\par "Could I meet him? I -- I mean, could you introduce me to him?" he asked in a rush. "It would be kind of fucking awesome to -- sorry -- you know, talk to someone like that? For me, I mean. You probably don't really care as much or ... well, that's not ... too weird to ask, is it? Really?"{&1310}\par I just stared at him blankly for a couple seconds.{&1310}\par "Um, I, uh ... I guess \i not\i0  ..."{&1310}\par That ... wasn't what I'd been expecting him to say.{&1310}\par "Great! Really, that's ... you have no idea how awesome this could be for me."{&1310}\par He had that big, boyish-looking grin splitting his face again as he rambled on excitedly at me, thanking me like it was some huge favor every other breath. And I didn't know what else to say, really. People always wanted to see dad. Work. Research. Technical discussions. I'd never had anyone ever bother going through me to do it.{&1310}\par Then it made sense.{&1310}\par My dad was important. I was a way to access him unofficially in a much more personal capacity. I was a way to get a name inside Nolan Weir's head that might actually stick, unlike the usual methods. You didn't have to be a fleet officer or a head scientest or a political dignitary to go through me. You just had to be a young soon-to-be-officer with some psychokinetic aptitude playing friendly with the admiral's daughter that-{&1310}\par "... Weir? I mean, uh, Evelyn?"{&1310}\par "Yeah?"{&1310}\par I blinked back at him. He was just giving me this weird look like he was waiting for something.{&1310}\par "What?"{&1310}\par "Are you ..." His eyes flashed toward the door and then back at me. "... Going to -- you know? Buzz him?"{&1310}\par I blinked at him again, not sure how to process that for a second. Then I shook my head and clicked back into the present.{&1310}\par "Yeah. Sure. One ... one second."{&1310}\par I guess he might have been using me. It was possible, and Tess would've thought that without meeting him. He seemed genuine, though, and I believed him when he said he'd never thought about Dr. Weir actually being my father before. What did it matter anyways? Did I care? Not really. Maybe he'd make things less awkward for me by being distracting.{&1310}\par Yeah. That was a good plan. Morisant would be proud ...{&1310}\par My hand lifted up toward the comm just like before and I hesitated just like before. Those other times I hadn't had some excited boot Pyscho standing right behind me waiting for me to do it, though. Maybe that was enough to finally get me to go in. Peer pressure.{&1310}\par My hand started shaking again.{&1310}\par Oh god, I still wasn't ready.{&1310}\par \i When were you ever going to be\i0 ?{&1310}\par I don't know.{&1310}\par I pushed the call button before I could think about it anymore. The chime faintly sounded on this side of the door for us to hear. My blood suddenly ran cold along with it.{&1310}\par No one answered at first. I waited, feeling flash-frozen in time, for someone to -- for that door to \i whoosh\i0  open and see Dr. Nolan Weir standing there looking like a stranger after so long. I \i felt \i0 like he was a stranger after so long. I felt like I couldn't even remember his face. The memory slipped away inside my head when I panicked then and tried to reach for it.{&1310}\par I glanced back at Miller when nothing happened for almost a minute. He frowned at the door and then me, looking quickly more and more disappointed as nothing happened. "Is he not home?"{&1310}\par "I -- I don't know."{&1310}\par I shook my head, but I did know. I did. I just kind of hoped he wouldn't answer. What a terrible person I was. To hope for that.{&1310}\par Miller had visibly deflated by then. And he'd already started to mumble some defeated promise to himself about maybe trying another day and shifting away when a voice finally broke out through the comm on the door. {&1310}\par "Come in, Evelyn."\cf2\f2 {&1310}\par }{&1310}

Dressed in civvies with his hair having gone uncombed all day, it looked like.{&1310}\par "What are you, ah, doing over here, Weir," he asked across the way at me. A couple marines practically ran him over and he bounced out of the way in my direction. And, for the first time, I realized I'd been standing there staring at a door for fifteen minutes without doing anything, looking like an idiot.{&1310}\par I sighed.{&1310}\par "You don't have to call me that here, you know?" Being called by my last name reminded me of the Academy and dad both. It was his name more than mine. His reputation, not mine. I hadn't earned it.{&1310}\par He reached my side of the thoroughfare ahead of the evening transit trying to run him over and just gave me a confused look. "Okay. What should I call you then?"{&1310}\par I barked a bitter little laugh in my throat. Six months, and he didn't even remember my first name -- maybe never even knew it at all. Well, I guess I'd forgotten his too ...{&1310}\par "Quincy," I said, aloud. He frowned.{&1310}\par "That's ... not your name," he told me, uncertainly. Then, "Right?"{&1310}\par "Evelyn," I corrected myself. God, I was so out of it right now. "Sorry, I'm -- I'm a little busy right now."{&1310}\par "Sorry, I didn't mean to, uh, wh -- with what?"{&1310}\par His face flushed a little as he cleared his throat. Shifted feet. I realized he'd kind of been doing that the whole time every few seconds. I hadn't really been paying attention until that suddenly reminded me of what Hammar had said that day before we left the Academy. When he'd tried to get Komi to hook up with him on leave.{&1310}\par And then it was my turn to feel heat suddenly start scouring my face.{&1310}\par "Visiting my dad," I managed to choke out, then cleared my throat too.{&1310}\par Oh my god, he actually had a crush on me.{&1310}\par No, no, no -- that was crazy. Hammar had just been trolling him. Me. Us.{&1310}\par What?{&1310}\par But he was \i here\i0  -- talking to \i me\i0 . And had been kind of going out of his way to chat me up in transit.{&1310}\par Why? Komi was at least ten times better, and I was as good as flunked out. Everyone must have known it. Mills must have known it. He'd be gone soon and never see me again anyways.{&1310}\par "Weir? I mean, uh, Evelyn?" he was suddenly trying to get my attention.{&1310}\par "--yeah, I--"{&1310}\par I glanced back, saw the door to dad's quarters again, and remembered why I was here and what I was doing. Sort of.{&1310}\par "I haven't seen him in a while. Since -- well, you know. I mean, you have your family here too, right?"{&1310}\par I was spitting out words at him as fast as I could. They came tumbling out over each other from my mouth and I garbled out another little shaky laugh at the end that I tried to swallow back down almost as quickly as it came. Then I clamped my mouth shut.{&1310}\par First I'd looked like an idiot. Now I \i sounded\i0  like one.{&1310}\par Thankfully, he glanced right past me and didn't even notice that dumbstruck look on my face. He saw the name on the apartment listing instead.{&1310}\par "Wow," he gaped, slipping past me to get a closer look. Like it would suddenly change who it was on the readout. "You're father is \i that\i0  Weir?" he asked, incredulous for a moment. "\i Admiral\i0  Weir?"{&1310}\par "Retired," I offered quickly, then hesitated. It's not like there were a lot of other Weirs on the whole station. At least, I'd never heard of any.{&1310}\par "Yeah, but he's still one of the top guys in the Psychokinetic Research division, and on the Board, right? Christ, he's probably one of the most powerful, natural psychokinetics in the entire sector!"{&1310}\par "Yeah ..."{&1310}\par His excitement completely dwarfed and overrode all my apprehensions. Not that it obliterated them for me -- I was still terrified of the idea of opening that door and finding out what was in store for me after six months without speaking to dad. But \i he\i0  couldn't have seen it at all. All that awkwardness from a few seconds ago was gone and he was just sitting there now, looking suddenly eager. Still uncertain, but eager.{&1310}\par "Would you," he started, thought better of it, and then started again. "Could I meet him? I, uh -- I mean, could you introduce me to him? That's not too much to ask, is it? Really?"{&1310}\par "Um, I, uh ... I guess \i not\i0  but ..."{&1310}\par He didn't even let me finish. He just had this big, boyish-looking grin suddenly split his face as he whipped around and reached for door caller.{&1310}\par "No wait!"{&1310}\par But he'd already pushed it, the chime faintly sounding on this side of the door for us to hear. And my blood ran cold with it.{&1310}\par "What?" Mills glanced back at me with a frown. "Is he not home yet?"{&1310}\par Oh god, I still wasn't ready.{&1310}\par \i When were you ever going to be\i0 ?{&1310}\par I don't know.\cf2\f2 {&1310}\par }{&1310}

That thought in my head kept coming back when it shouldn't have -- so insistent that I could \i see\i0  her dead, mangled body when I closed my eyes. Dad's too. And Bertram's.{&1310}\par For all I knew that dead woman in chunks on top of me was all that was left of my best friend. What would she even be doing here?

Besides, maybe she couldn't really be dead if I never saw the body.{&1310}\par I laid there too long. {&1310}\par Because, eventually, I felt ... {&1310}\par \i IT\i0 .{&1310}\par A dull pain in the front of my head. It was so small at first I didn't even notice it with all the fear-born adrenaline still burning away inside my veins. Then it got stronger. A lot stronger. Like a rising tide of searing-hot, blistering pain. All sound died off in first one ear, then the other. White noise seethed out to replace it. I winced and cried out soundlessly as the roar grew louder and louder and louder. And louder.{&1310}\par ... \i can't\i0  ...{&1310}\par ... \i think\i0  ...!{&1310}\par --\b VELYN\b0 --{&1310}\par Something new grated inside my skull.

And doubled.{&1310}\par I must have blacked out because when I came back, my body had managed to turn my neck. I don't know how. I could barely even register what I was seeing. That white-hot slicing inside my skull had died back down to barely lethal levels again. My mouth was wide open screaming, but no sound came out at all. If it ever had, I would probably be dead.{&1310}\par --\b COME TO ME\b0 --{&1310}\par Suddenly, it stopped.

It wasn't. It really wasn't. I squinted and concentrated and willed it to stop, the whimsical thought in my head that here -- \i here\i0  I would suddenly discover some latent ability that'd been buried inside me all along. Right on Dr. Nolan Weir's doorstep.{&1310}\par I was stalling. {&1310}\par Mostly.{&1310}\par Tess had left me about twenty minutes ago and it had taken me a full ten to get here. Because I dragged my feet. Because I let every little thing and person along the way slow me down. And I let each wayward, nonsensical thought distract me for another ten minutes while I stood there, perched on the threshold in a strange mixture of trepidation and excitement. I hadn't spoken to dad in six months.{&1310}\par A flash of anger. It was enough to let me steel myself and set my jaw like I'd buzz his quarters this time. I knew he was there. I'd checked his scheduled office hours, and he always took them at home where he could keep working. In private. He'd been too busy to see me off and he'd probably been too busy again to see me back, but he \i wasn't\i0  going to be too busy to talk to his own daughter before she shipped off to get eaten alive by some creepy psycho commander on a military base in the middle of nowhere where-{&1310}\par What if he knew? What if he already knew how screwed I was? How terrible my performance was? That the daughter of one of the most powerful and respected psychokinetics in the sector -- who knew, maybe even the entire \i system\i0  -- didn't have any ability at all? That she was mundane, defective -- just \i normal\i0 . What if he already knew all that? He had connections still -- more so now that he was retired it always seemed like to me.{&1310}\par I slumped and my hand fell again. For the third time. And I spent the next five minutes convincing myself that the reason he had never bothered leaving me any messages at all was because he had snooped in on the reports and seen just how horrible they'd been and been ashamed. Maybe even embarassed. Maybe even pretended I didn't exist for a while so it wouldn't get back on him that I'd failed.{&1310}\par My one big chance to prove something ... I don't even know what. That I was worth something too? That no one would have to put us together and take pity on me? That some of that familial talent had rubbed off from the gene pool and wasn't just going to disappear forever?{&1310}\par Maybe.{&1310}\par It would have helped if he'd at least have-{&1310}\par "W-Weir?"{&1310}\par I jumped in surprise. I almost fell over too as I spun back around. "He's not ..." \i Home\i0 , I started to say -- why was I lying? -- but stopped, when I saw who it was.{&1310}\par Miller had stopped mid-stride on his way down the corridor behind me and was gaping at me sideways. Dressed in civvies with his hair having gone uncombed all day, it looked like.{&1310}\par "What are you, ah, doing over here, Weir," he asked across the way at me. A couple marines practically ran him over and he bounced out of the way in my direction. And, for the first time, I realized I'd been standing there staring at a door for fifteen minutes without doing anything, looking like an idiot.{&1310}\par I sighed. I pushed all of the air out of my lungs in one long, overexaggerated breath.{&1310}\par "You don't have to call me that here, you know?" I told him then.{&1310}\par Being called by my last name reminded me of the Academy and dad both. It was his name more than mine. His reputation, not mine. I hadn't earned it.{&1310}\par He reached my side of the thoroughfare ahead of the evening transit trying to run him over and just gave me a confused look. "Okay. What should I call you then?"{&1310}\par I barked a bitter little laugh in my throat. Six months, and he didn't even remember my first name -- maybe never even knew it at all. Well, I guess I'd forgotten his too ...{&1310}\par "Quincy," I said, aloud. He frowned.{&1310}\par "That's ... not your name," he told me, uncertainly. Then, "Right?"{&1310}\par "Evelyn," I corrected myself. God, I was so out of it right now. "Sorry, I'm -- I'm a little busy right now."{&1310}\par "Sorry, I didn't mean to, uh, wh -- with what?"{&1310}\par His face flushed a little as he cleared his throat. Shifted feet. I realized he'd kind of been doing that the whole time every few seconds. I hadn't really been paying attention until that suddenly reminded me of what Hammar had said that day before we left the Academy. When he'd tried to get Komi to hook up with him on leave.{&1310}\par And then it was my turn to feel heat suddenly start scouring my face.{&1310}\par "Visiting my dad," I managed to choke out, then cleared my throat too.{&1310}\par Oh my god, he actually had a crush on me.{&1310}\par No, no, no -- that was crazy. Hammar had just been trolling him. Me. Us.{&1310}\par What?{&1310}\par But he was \i here\i0  -- talking to \i me\i0 . And had been kind of going out of his way to chat me up in transit.{&1310}\par Why? Komi was at least ten times better, and I was as good as flunked out. Everyone must have known it. Mills must have known it. He'd be gone soon and never see me again anyways.{&1310}\par "Weir? I mean, uh, Evelyn?" he was suddenly trying to get my attention.{&1310}\par "--yeah, I--"{&1310}\par I glanced back, saw the door to dad's quarters again, and remembered why I was here and what I was doing. Sort of.{&1310}\par "I haven't seen him in a while. Since -- well, you know. I mean, you have your family here too, right?"{&1310}\par I was spitting out words at him as fast as I could. They came tumbling out over each other from my mouth and I garbled out another little shaky laugh at the end that I tried to swallow back down almost as quickly as it came. Then I clamped my mouth shut.{&1310}\par First I'd looked like an idiot. Now I \i sounded\i0  like one.{&1310}\par Thankfully, he glanced right past me and didn't even notice that dumbstruck look on my face. He saw the name on the apartment listing instead.{&1310}\par "Wow," he gaped, slipping past me to get a closer look. Like it would suddenly change who it was on the readout. "You're father is \i that\i0  Weir?" he asked, incredulous for a moment. "\i Admiral\i0  Weir?"{&1310}\par "Retired," I offered quickly, then hesitated. It's not like there were a lot of other Weirs on the whole station. At least, I'd never heard of any.{&1310}\par "Yeah, but he's still one of the top guys in the Psychokinetic Research division, and on the Board, right? Christ, he's probably one of the most powerful, natural psychokinetics on the entire station!"{&1310}\par "Yeah ..."{&1310}\par His excitement completely dwarfed and overrode all my apprehensions. Not that it obliterated them for me -- I was still terrified of the idea of opening that door and finding out what was in store for me after six months without speaking to dad. But \i he\i0  couldn't have seen it at all. All that awkwardness from a few seconds ago was gone and he was just sitting there now, looking suddenly eager. Still uncertain, but eager.{&1310}\par "Would you," he started, thought better of it, and then started again. "Could I meet him? I, uh -- I mean, could you introduce me to him? That's not too much to ask, is it? Really?"{&1310}\par "Um, I, uh ... I guess \i not\i0  but ..."{&1310}\par He didn't even let me finish. He just had this big, boyish-looking grin suddenly split his face as he whipped around and reached for door caller.{&1310}\par "No wait!"{&1310}\par But he'd already pushed it, the chime faintly sounding on this side of the door for us to hear. And my blood ran cold along with it.{&1310}\par "What?" Mills glanced back at me with a frown. "Is he not home yet?"{&1310}\par Oh god, I still wasn't ready.{&1310}\par \i When were you ever going to be\i0 ?{&1310}\par I don't know.{&1310}\par No one answered at first. I waited, feeling flash-frozen in time, for someone to, for that door to \i whoosh\i0  open and see Dr. Nolan Weir standing there looking like a stranger after so long. I felt like a stranger after so long. I felt like I couldn't even remember his face. The memory slipped away inside my head when I panicked and tried to reach for it.{&1310}\par Eventually, Mills turned back to me again, looking disappointed. "I guess he really isn't in?"{&1310}\par "I -- I don't know."{&1310}\par I shook my head, but I did know. I did. I just kind of hoped he wouldn't answer. What a terrible person I was. To hope for that.{&1310}\par Miller had visibly deflated again after the second buzz went unanswered. And he'd already turned fully away when a voice finally broke out through the comm on the door. "Come in, Evelyn," it said. And all that anxiety, dread, and anger suddenly came to a head.{&1310}\par The door opened. Mills gave me a look after a second of just standing there. He was waiting for me. Right. It would have been odd for him to just barge in instead of me, uninvited. Of course. Right. So I did the only thing I could do just then. {&1310}\par I trudged ahead, and past him, inside.\cf2\f2 {&1310}\par }{&1310}

That voice just kept on stabbing at the insides of my skull.{&1310}\par \b --LOOK AROU\b0 --{&1310}\par --\b KNOW IT HUR\b0 --{&1310}\par --\b NT BREAK CONTACT\b0 --{&1310}\par \i yes oh my god please fucking god yes break contact please!\i0 {&1310}\par \b --LOOK AROUND--{&1310}\par \b0 My skull was too wired to move. I'd squeezed my eyes shut without even realizing it because I couldn't process anything else coming into or out of my brain. Now they opened. I'd have done anything if it would have made that blind, molten agony inside my head go away. \i Anything\i0 .{&1310}\par I couldn't move at all, though. My body was spasming and convulsing all over like I was having a seizure. Maybe I was. I wondered if those things would hear me shaking there and come b-{&1310}\par That pain doubled. And doubled. And doubled.{&1310}\par I must have blacked out because when I came back, my body had managed to turn my neck. I don't know how. I could barely even register what I was seeing. That white-hot slicing inside my skull had died back down to barely lethal levels again. My mouth was wide open screaming, but no sound would come out. If it ever had, I would probably be dead soon anyways.{&1310}\par --\b COME TO ME\b0 --{&1310}\par Suddenly, it stopped. And so did my brain.{&1310}\par {&1310}\par \pard\sl480\slmult1\qc *\tab *\tab *{&1310}\par {&1310}\par \pard\fi720\sl480\slmult1 My hand hung in the air while I just stood there, staring at it as it shook ever so slightly with nervous energy like it was the most fascinating thing on the station. It wasn't. It really wasn't. I squinted and concentrated and willed it to stop, the whimsical thought in my head that here -- \i here\i0  I would suddenly discover some latent ability that'd been buried inside me all along, in the dumbest way imaginable. Right here on Dr. Nolan Weir's doorstep.{&1310}\par I was stalling. {&1310}\par Mostly.{&1310}\par Tess had left me about twenty minutes ago and it had taken me a full ten to get here. Because I dragged my feet. Because I let every little thing and person along the way slow me down. And I let each wayward, nonsensical thought distract me for another ten minutes while I stood there, perched on the threshold in a strange mixture of trepidation and excitement. I hadn't spoken to dad in six months.{&1310}\par A flash of anger. It was enough to let me steel myself and set my jaw like I'd buzz his quarters this time. I knew he was there. I'd checked his scheduled office hours, and he always took them at home where he could keep working. In private. He'd been too busy to see me off and he'd probably been too busy again to see me back, but he \i wasn't\i0  going to be too busy to talk to his own daughter before she shipped off to get eaten alive by some creepy psycho commander on a military base in the middle of nowhere where-{&1310}\par What if he knew? What if he already knew how screwed I was? How terrible my performance was? That the daughter of one of the most powerful and respected psychokinetics in the sector -- who knew, maybe even the entire \i system\i0  -- didn't have any ability at all? That she was mundane, defective -- just \i normal\i0 . What if he already knew all that? He had connections still -- more so now that he was retired it always seemed like to me.{&1310}\par I slumped and my hand fell again. For the third time. And I spent the next five minutes convincing myself that the reason he had never bothered leaving me any messages at all was because he had snooped in on the reports and seen just how horrible they'd been and been ashamed. Maybe even embarassed. Maybe even pretended I didn't exist for a while so it wouldn't get back on him that I'd failed.{&1310}\par My one big chance to prove something ... I don't even know what. That I was worth something too? That no one would have to put us together and take pity on me? That some of that familial talent had rubbed off from the gene pool and wasn't just going to disappear forever?{&1310}\par Maybe.{&1310}\par It would have helped if he'd at least have-{&1310}\par "W-Weir?"{&1310}\par I jumped in surprise. I almost fell over too as I spun back around.{&1310}\par "He's not ..." {&1310}\par \i Home\i0 , I started to say -- wait, why was I lying? -- but stopped, when I saw who it was.{&1310}\par Miller had frozen mid-stride on his way down the corridor behind and was gaping at me sideways. Dressed in civvies and looking much more cleaned up from how we'd fallen out of the G-tubes that morning on the frigate.{&1310}\par "What are you, ah, doing over here, Weir," he asked across the way at me. A couple marines practically ran him over and he bounced out of the way in my direction. The shock of it suddenly ripped me out of that mental fugue and made me realize just what I'd been doing for the past fifteen minutes. Just \i standing\i0  there ... staring at a door. Looking like an idiot.{&1310}\par He reached my side of the thoroughfare ahead of the evening transit trying to run him over and cocked his head at me. "Well?"{&1310}\par "I, uh ..." I threw a turned back toward the door that I'd been standing in front of that whole time and just stared for a few more seconds. Then I shook my head. "I was going to see my dad."{&1310}\par "Oh, yeah? Who's that? I mean, if you don't mind me just-"{&1310}\par He looked past me toward the door as I opened my mouth to answer. Then I didn't have to because he was suddenly gaping. {&1310}\par "Wow." He slipped past me to get a closer look. Like it would suddenly change who it was on the readout. "You're father is \i that\i0  Weir?" he asked, incredulous for a moment. "\i Admiral\i0  Weir?"{&1310}\par "He's retired, but yeah, I guess so ..."{&1310}\par "Wow," was all Mills could say, taking a deep breath with a still stunned look on his face. He laughed, shaking his head. "That's so crazy, Weir. I wouldn't have guessed."{&1310}\par "It's not like there are a lot of Weirs on the station ..." I said. In fact, I couldn't think of any other one. "And you don't have to call me that here, you know?"{&1310}\par "Yeah, but I never would have guess that you were \i his\i0 - oh, uh ... sorry. I didn't mean it like that. Really."{&1310}\par He must have seen the look on my face, and I realized that I had one as soon as he said that.{&1310}\par "So, um, Evelyn then?" he asked, clearing his throat.{&1310}\par "Yeah. Why not."{&1310}\par Being called by my last name reminded me of the Academy and dad both. It was his name more than mine. His reputation, not mine. I hadn't earned it.{&1310}\par "So you were going to see your dad for the first time since you got back?" He continued, and I just shrugged. "Sorry, I didn't mean to get in the middle of that."{&1310}\par "It's okay," I offered quickly. \i Too\i0  quickly.{&1310}\par "I mean, that's gotta be intense. He's one of the top guys in the Psychokinetic Research division, and on the Board, right? Christ," Mills put a palm to his head and shook it, "he's probably one of the most powerful, natural psychokinetics on the entire station!"{&1310}\par "Yeah ..."{&1310}\par "I can't believe I never even thought about it the whole time," he kept on to himself in that bewildered tone. "Six months and I never even bothered to ... just --wow ..."{&1310}\par I stood there while he thought about how crazy that was a little longer, not sure what to do with my hands now that I wasn't alone anymore and I was painfully aware of it. Mills' whole suddenly being here had derailed me completely -- not that I'd really been going much of anywhere or even had an overall plan, but I was going to get around to something. Eventually. And I couldn't quite decide if I hated him for it or simply felt relieved to be distracted a little while longer.{&1310}\par "Would you," he started abruptly out of that incredulous thought flow, and I broke in with a "Hmm?" before he could even finish. Too fast again. But he thought better of whatever he was going to say, found the right words, and then started again. {&1310}\par "Could I meet him? I -- I mean, could you introduce me to him?" he asked in a rush. "It would be kind of fucking awesome to -- sorry -- you know, talk to someone like that? For me, I mean. You probably don't really care as much or ... well, that's not ... too weird to ask, is it? Really?"{&1310}\par "Um, I, uh ... I guess \i not\i0  ..."{&1310}\par "Great! Really, that's ... you have no idea how awesome this could be for me."{&1310}\par He had this big, boyish-looking grin splitting his face as he rambled on excitedly at me, thanking me like it was some huge favor ever other breath. I just kind of shrugged at him, not really sure what else to say.{&1310}\par "... Weir? I mean, uh, Evelyn?"{&1310}\par "Yeah?"{&1310}\par I blinked back at him. He was just giving me this weird look like he was waiting for something.{&1310}\par "What?"{&1310}\par "Are you ..." His eyes flashed toward the door and then back at me. "... Going to -- you know? Buzz him?"{&1310}\par I blinked at him again, not sure how to process that for a second. Then I shook my head and clicked back into the present.{&1310}\par "Yeah. Sure. One ... one second."{&1310}\par My hand lifted up toward the comm just like before and I hesitated just like before. Those other times I hadn't had some excited boot Pyscho standing right behind me waiting for me to do it, though. Maybe that was enough to finally get me to go in.{&1310}\par My hand started shaking again.{&1310}\par Oh god, I still wasn't ready.{&1310}\par \i When were you ever going to be\i0 ?{&1310}\par I don't know.{&1310}\par I pushed the call button before I could think about it anymore. The chime faintly sounding on this side of the door for us to hear. My blood suddenly ran cold along with it.{&1310}\par No one answered at first. I waited, feeling flash-frozen in time, for someone to -- for that door to \i whoosh\i0  open and see Dr. Nolan Weir standing there looking like a stranger after so long. I \i felt \i0 like a stranger after so long. I felt like I couldn't even remember his face. The memory slipped away inside my head when I panicked then and tried to reach for it.{&1310}\par I glanced back at Miller when nothing happened for almost a minute. He frowned at the door and then me, looking quickly more and more disappointed as nothing happened.  "Is he not home?"{&1310}\par "I -- I don't know."{&1310}\par I shook my head, but I did know. I did. I just kind of hoped he wouldn't answer. What a terrible person I was. To hope for that.{&1310}\par Miller had visibly deflated by then. And he'd already started to mumble some defeated promise to himself about maybe trying another day and shifting away when a voice finally broke out through the comm on the door. {&1310}\par "Come in, Evelyn."\cf2\f2 {&1310}\par }{&1310}
