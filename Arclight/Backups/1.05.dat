We people-watched from up on the catwalks while the nebulae from the Rift flared down through the massive view ports above. Sometimes in the middle of the day, it'd overwhelm all the artificial lighting in the courtyards and turn everything that same purplish-red color. You could always tell someone new to the station by how much they gawked at that.{&1310}\par "Too bad," Tess sighed aloud at some point. She was perched with her chin in one hand, leaning on the rail and looking up. I'd been looking down.{&1310}\par "Too bad what?"{&1310}\par "Out there," she pointed to the Rift. "It'd be nice to go out there."{&1310}\par "I guess."{&1310}\par "You know I could get us on one of those survey ships. It would be easy."{&1310}\par "Then do it."{&1310}\par She gave me a sidelong look. Then just shook her head.{&1310}\par "You wouldn't go. Who are you kidding?"{&1310}\par "Why not?"{&1310}\par Maybe I just sounded too bored, because she didn't bother to answer. Just kept giving me that eye. Eventually, she started off in a new direction without much warning as usual.{&1310}\par "You see old Wier-do lately?"{&1310}\par I shook my head. "Nope."{&1310}\par "Maybe you should find out what he's doing," she told me then. And I threw out a hand{&1310}\par "I don't need anymore study material."{&1310}\par "You sure?" she laughed. "No, but really. Maybe you should talk ta him. You know - just ask him what's up, and ... stuff. You know ..."{&1310}\par I laughed at the serious caste to her face. It was so ... weird. She caught me staring, and shrugged.{&1310}\par "What are \i you \i0 lookin' at?"{&1310}\par "You going to skip out on Ressler again later?" I asked instead, changing the subject on her. She let out a long sigh at that.{&1310}\par "I was thinking about it." She slumped down onto both elbows along the rail before glancing back up at me. "Why?"{&1310}\par "Because I don't want to get stuck cleaning the ducts out for him again by myself."{&1310}\par A smile broke out slowly across her face{&1310}\par "Oh, yeah ... sorry."{&1310}\par "No you're not."{&1310}\par She laughed about the whole thing to herself, quietly, for a while. I went back to watching the people moving about below in the courtyards. Some of the gardeners were out now. Every so often dad loaned me out for some chores with them. It was better than working maintenance for Ressler. Sometimes I wondered if anyone might actually be paying dad or if I really was just doing it out of the goodness of my heart because he told me to. Either way, it's not like I was any good at any of those things.{&1310}\par "By the way ..."{&1310}\par Tess came back down to me with a faraway look in her eye.{&1310}\par "You wouldn't happen to have the- Oh."{&1310}\par I stuck out the data stick I'd pulled out of my jacket pocket for her. "All of the books for the last week."{&1310}\par "Sweet."{&1310}\par She lit up at that, snatching the thing eagerly from my fingers and tucking it away. It was habit by now, but I still shook my head. I was already sick of them before dad even opened his mouth to assign a new one. Not her, though. I guess it was easier to want what you couldn't have. God knows, no one would trust her around anything valuable or important.{&1310}\par "You remembered it this time," she couldn't help muttering under her breath, and barking a laugh of a sudden. "You know what? Yesterday, I was- oh shit."{&1310}\par Her eyes went wide. Horrified. And I spun around to see where she was looking.{&1310}\par "What?"{&1310}\par I got my answer just as quickly. Part of it, anyways. A man in Watch uniform was making his way toward us from the other end of the catwalk. Fast.{&1310}\par I twisted right back around at Tess.{&1310}\par "What did you do?!"{&1310}\par I started to cry out at her. But I only got partway. Before I could even open my mouth, she was already moving.{&1310}\par "Run!" she shouted back over her shoulder at me without even glancing back.{&1310}\par "HEY!"{&1310}\par I took off after Tess in a blind rush, and that man bellowed out at us from behind. I heard the heavy thudding of his boots as he broke into a run too.{&1310}\par My legs were still a little shaky after the other day with Jonathon, but I could outrun Tess in a flat sprint any day. I bolted, and flew right past her by the time I had caught up. She huffed something back at me, but I couldn't make it out. I just heard the Watchman behind us.{&1310}\par "... To hell with this."{&1310}\par Tess broke left and hopped the railing. I don't know what the hell she was thinking, but I didn't get a chance to care. A step away from the end of the catwalk, something bit into my back and every muscle in my body went limp all at once. I toppled like a dropped sack, folded up, and half-rolled over onto my face into the first stair down.{&1310}\par And then I had just enough time to watch the Watchman make the last few steps easy on himself catching up with me as I lay there twitching in spurts against the metal.{&1310}\par "Nice try, kid."\cf2\f1 {&1310}\par }{&1310}
