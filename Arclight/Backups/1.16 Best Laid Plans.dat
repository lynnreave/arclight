It took three minutes to plot the new course, and another thirty hours to reach Brekke Transit Hub near the Dreggoran epicycle. No parting farewells from those they had known and grown old with for twenty years. No final words to betray them before they even started. Just the way it had to be. The girl was not please, though.{&1310}\par It was almost a day before Evelyn regained consciousness, and then it was only enough to wonder groggily aloud again where she was and what had happened. Thaddeus had skimmed her comatose mind enough to prompt her body into a hyperaccelerated rate of healing and repair, but it had taken its toll. She was at a loss for what happened after two men ambushed her in the old maintenance tunnels back on the station.{&1310}\par Nolan was content to leave it that way, though the information might have proven to be of some use. But the less she knew, the better and more protected she was. It was not as if she was in much of a position to fight him on the matter either. That did not stop her curious mind from wandering, however, and submitting him to a barrage of meddling questions.{&1310}\par She woke up starving and dehydrated from her accelerated recovery despite his efforts to make her eat and drink while still only semi-conscious. A little mind-probing to that effect was mere child's play. Her metabolism had been overloaded, and she consumed all that she could manage to get her hands on in a short period of time before collapsing back to sleep from fatigue. She managed to start the interrogation before it took her.{&1310}\par He deflected her questions and insinuated to her that the whol affair was just some temporary, long-awaited sabbatical from the station. In her adled state of mind and lack of reliable short-term memory, the implications were subtle and strong enough to make sense to her without much effort. He acted as if nothing were amiss but her and that befuddled state and she accepted it at that. Eagerly even. And it spared him some of the more difficult questions about their circumstances to evade.{&1310}\par As soon as she was more fully awake, the trip fell into a brief routine of idle questions about his plans and half-lamented whimsy over leaving everyone on Riftwatch behind. Despite her fragile condition, Evelyn continued to chatter excitedly about it all without the faintest idea what he was really about or why. And Nolan buried himself in his thoughts about that very thing., barely leaving the pilot's chair for the entire thirty hours.{&1310}\par He hardly ate and didn't sleep. The girl must have started to suspect by the time they reached the hub, even though she had been asleep for most of it. Her excitement abated too quickly, and she turned to studying him when she thought he wasn't paying attention instead. He was always paying attention. And he made a note to himself to hide his preoccupation better in the coming days.{&1310}\par The Brekke Transit Hub changed from a distant, unmoving speck against the black to a floating spire in a matter of hours. And Evelyn could hardly take her eyes off it once it came into view.{&1310}\par "What \i is\i0  that?" she demanded from the front of the craft with her face all but pressed flat into the porthole. It interrupted his thoughts while he draped himself over the pilot's consol, and she had to twist back around to get his attention. He glanced at the distant station, then at her, and finally back down to the console again.{&1310}\par "Our first stop," was all he said. Not that the girl would have left it at that.{&1310}\par "There?" she stabbed a finger eagerly at the transit hub in the porthole. "We're going there?" Her head bobbed incredulously. "We're getting on \i that\i0  there?"{&1310}\par Nolan ignored the question, still pondering one of several critical decisions he had to make. It wasn't as if another station should have been so exciting to her. He might have supposed she had never even seen Riftwatch from the exterior, however. And Evelyn was transfixed on the thing.{&1310}\par "Are there a lot of people onboard?" she pressed, eyes wide and mouth agape as she stood there wondering at the apparent novelty of it all.{&1310}\par "Yes."{&1310}\par "From the planets, you think?"{&1310}\par Again. "Yes."{&1310}\par He tried to get back to his thoughts and planning, but it was impossible with the way she continued firing off inane questions about this and that and everything. Infuriating, even. Especially considering how much was at stake. He had to remind himself, though, with an effort, that she had never known anything beyond Riftwatch in her entire life. Not so, for him.{&1310}\par They had to wait some time outside the transit hub's docking facilities while a port freed up for them to come aboard. Brekke was not as large as Geise, more obscure yet still crowded enough for his purposes. The place was just a minor departure point between several of the surrounding outposts and minor colonies, with a few larger ships frequenting it for the explicit purpose of ferrying travelers to Dreggor's Door. He could see one of them now, hanging down beneath the station on a long pylon. The girl seized on that soon enough, and wouldn't be quiet about it for some time.{&1310}\par A few more hours passed, but Evelyn hardly wore herself out. By the time someone fromt he docking authority authorized them to come aboard, Nolan had a headache that was making him edgier than he had already been. He snapped at the girl once or twice as they finally disembarked, but it lost its bite in the loudness of the crowds that greeted them. They might have dampened her spirits too, being some of the dirtiest, most unkempt people she must have ever seen, but it was hard to tell. He knew it was not the most welcome sight to his own eyes after so many years away.{&1310}\par "Evelyn! Stay near me."{&1310}\par \pard\fi720\sl480\slmult1\highlight0 She had started off almost immediately and he had to rein her in like a small child. The look she gave him back over her shoulder was about as petulant. He snatched her hand firmly in his and dragged her along behind him.{&1310}\par The crowd was hard to push through, it was so thick down by the docks. They couldn't help being jostled by people who had more filth and diseases than Nolan cared to think about. Riftwatch had been a clean, controlled place. The irony of suddenly succumbing to something simple after all that time did not sit well with him at all. The less reputable hubs like that didn't have good scrubbers.{&1310}\par He got them on an elevator to the upper decks first. That was even more unpleasant than the docking areas they left behind. He suffered several more minutes squashed together with more of the system's vagrants than he could have hoped for to get to a free terminal on the promenade decks.{&1310}\par "Wait right here," he told the girl with a harsh eye when they got there. She played irritated and impatient with him, folding her arms and glancing wistfully about. He just rounded on the terminal, however, and started with his message.{&1310}\par It took a few minutes. Despite the abruptness of the whole affair, matters were still going according to plan and on schedule. Not that he had left much room for doubt. He had had more than twenty years to prepare for that moment after all. More than enough time to get it right.{&1310}\par But never without a few doubts.{&1310}\par "Evelyn."{&1310}\par The girl jumped when he turned around and called her name. She had still been standing there behaving - a small miracle. Her attention had been elsewhere, though, and he had to snap her out of it.{&1310}\par "What were you looking at?"{&1310}\par He came up beside her, glancing the way she'd been staring. It had not been the whimsical fancy of the past minutes or several hours. And he could worry about so abrupt a shift in her out here.{&1310}\par "Nothing," she shook her head quickly, though, dismissing it. "I just ... I thought I saw someone."{&1310}\par "Come on." He took her by the arm and started pulling her away again. A few looks over his shoulder were not wasted in his wary concerns.{&1310}\par There was no incident as they reached another elevator down to the transport ship they would be taking. The girl sobered some, but still bubbled with that enthusiasm. And, for a few moments, with Riftwatch behind them and the rest of the system ahead,Nolan could almost entertain the fantasy of that turning into a real holiday of sorts for her, with home waiting up for them to return. He had lost touch in two decades, and it left him nostalgic. But he crushed that sentimentalism in his head quickly enough,.{&1310}\par A few more hours as they waited to board the passenger ship \i Menhir\i0 , bled a little bit more of that excitement right out of the girl. She was downright manageable by the time they were allowed in. And the accomodations she had to look forward to were little better than that of a refugee camp, buried in the bowels of the ship. Anything else would have meant registering with the passenger manifest. And that was something he would not do.{&1310}\par \pard\fi720\sl480\slmult1 So they made it on board with little incident. Unnoticed. Ignored by fellow passengers and crew alike, with the odd exception or two for their superior health and dress - exceptions that he made mental note to keep an eye on if necessary. It all went just as he had planned. And, just as he had planned, they were underway and flying fast toward Lyricum within forty-eight hours of the enemy's first move.\cf2\highlight0 {&1310}\par }{&1310}
