Chief Petty Officer Holloway's chair slipped away from the examination table back toward his readouts. He had a thoughtful look on his face. "Seems you're always in here during field exercises with headaches, Weir."{&1310}\par "\i Severe \i0 headaches," I corrected him. It was bad enough that Lieutenant Morsant always tried to play it down like an excuse and the med staff could never find anything wrong with me. "Chief."{&1310}\par A Corpsman had already checked me over in the field before they shipped me back, but I barely remembered it. My brain had felt like it was swimming inside my skull trying to get out, and I didn't like remembering that feeling. Field bio-scanners couldn't figure out what was wrong, though. They never could. It was why Morsant always thought I was just trying to cause problems for him.{&1310}\par Holloway pushed a finger to his temple. "Dynamo, get me something for grav-sickness in here, please." He said aloud to the air.{&1310}\par We were stuck in the back of the tiny sick bay of the command ship for that week's training exercises. I was the only one in there and the rest of the ship was mostly empty since all the other cadets were down on the rock. Just a skeleton crew with a small command staff watching over things on the bridge. {&1310}\par "It's \i not\i0  grav-sickness," I tried to tell him, but he just smiled at me.{&1310}\par "How's the implant?"{&1310}\par I groaned. "Still ... off. I think. I guess. I don't know." I shook my head.{&1310}\par They'd had to disable it almost as soon as they'd stuffed it in my head. I never even knew by the time I woke up - days later. It was kind of uncommon for people not to have \i some\i0  complications. Mine, though, had apparently been really bad.{&1310}\par "What's that, cadet?"{&1310}\par "I said I don't really know."{&1310}\par "Hm. That's when these headaches started, though. Right? I think I remember something about that in your report."{&1310}\par "Yeah. I guess so." They were supposed to remove it too. Eventually.{&1310}\par "Well, your scans didn't show anything so you can get up out of - woah, wait a minute ..."{&1310}\par He'd been about to turn away from his readouts when something caught his eye. He snapped back around and forgot about me.{&1310}\par "What? What is it?"{&1310}\par I almost jumped off the examination table.{&1310}\par "Did you see something?"{&1310}\par He frowned, tapped a few holographic buttons in mid-air, spinning an image of my skull in close before panning it around.{&1310}\par "I thought I saw something," he finally said, still distracted with it. Then started shaking his head. "Maybe a spot of interference in the lenses. Looks fine now."{&1310}\par "Are you sure?" I pushed my way up from the table and the live view of my head flickered and died. Holloway sighed and gave me a look.{&1310}\par "Not anymore I'm not."{&1310}\par "Oh."{&1310}\par "I'll have Dynamo take a look at it later and see if I missed anything." The door breathed open behind us and the robotic med-tech rolled in. Holloway took an applicator from him.{&1310}\par "Hopefully, this will help alleviate the symptoms. Reactions to transit pressures is common, despite the pods."{&1310}\par "It's not grav-sickness," I repeated, sagging back down against the table and looking away.{&1310}\par "Humor me."{&1310}\par I felt a pressure against the vein in my arm. I tried to think about other things, but I just kept coming back around to that dream.{&1310}\par "You'll have to stay aboard until the rest of your unit gets back from exercises at the end of the week," he said with too much bedside manner. Then he got back to whatever he was doing before I got thrown in his lap again for the fifth time this semester.\cf2\highlight0\f1 {&1310}\par }{&1310}
