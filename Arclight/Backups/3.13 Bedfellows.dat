News broadcasts had been covering the whole place since they discovered it early yesterday. And I watched as a man and woman onscreen droned on about that "brutal pirate attack" out in Shtess. No reported survivors.{&1310}\par Tess sat beside me on the bed, head in her hands. She'd only woken up an hour ago. Now, one unintentional look at the screen and those disfigured corpses forced her into a half-stumbling rush for the tiny bathroom. I heard her puking her guts out miserably in there for the next few minutes while I continued watching the feed. It wasn't like there was much else to do.{&1310}\par It'd taken them three days to figure out what happened there. Three days before all the channels started exploding with a flavored blend of desperation, anger, and misleadingly calm reactions to what they found in that backward mining town. There were so many news feeds, so many more than I'd ever seen back home. I guess we just never needed that many out in space.{&1310}\par There were horror stories. Loved ones crying. Friends and family. Revenge was a common theme. Almost every military official - and there were a lot of them - spoke in gruff, controlled overtones of hunting down those responsible. It proved Julian right, I think, when he warned us about them not letting us go if they ever found out we had anything to do with it. Sometimes I wondered if they shouldn't just do that.{&1310}\par When she finally dragged herself back out, Tess turned off the screen while pointedly refusing to look at it. She looked like death with those bloodshot-eyes and sickly-pale, sweaty skin. I flicked it back on without saying a word. {&1310}\par "Come on, Ev," she whined forlornly after just sitting there with only herself for company for a while. "Turn it off ..."{&1310}\par I kept watching without really hearing her. Or listening. We'd been stuck there for almost five days since we crashed into port. Time lost some meaning after everything that'd happened already. I just surfed the channels looking for coverage of the victims. For some reason, I couldn't get enough of making myself sick over watching them.{&1310}\par Tess groaned loudly next to me and hunched over, running her grimy hands up through her pink hair. She hadn't bothered to clean up since sitting in the shower a couple of days ago with all her clothes and shoes still on for at least an hour. I'd found her like that, staring off into the wall long after the water had gone cold and all but shut off. They had that stuff rationed around here. She was still rank and stale.{&1310}\par I just kept watching the news and, eventually, she snapped at me.{&1310}\par "Ev!"{&1310}\par "What."{&1310}\par I didn't look at her until she turned off the screen again.{&1310}\par "What are we gonna do?" she demanded irritably, flipping her hand. Like it was my job to come up with something. Or either of us should have had any better idea after days of just waiting around. I thought that's what Julian was for.{&1310}\par Again, I shook my head and shrugged. {&1310}\par I switched the screen back on.{&1310}\par And I must have pissed her off, because she picked up some little carving of a warship and threw the thing right at it. The display was entirely holographic, though, and just warped around as it passed. The ship bounced off the wall and burst into pieces. One smacked me in the face, the others scattered around the room.{&1310}\par I didn't look at her. I just felt tears start to well up behind my eyes as I cupped the place where the thing bounced off my cheekbone.{&1310}\par "Can I ask you something?" I mumbled at her then. The sound of my own voice was tinny, and pathetic, in that tiny space. It was a one-room apartment, dark and sparsely furnished except for some clothes thrown haphazardly about in places. And it made me really sad and homesick all of a sudden.{&1310}\par Tess softened so abruptly when I looked at her that her answer was almost dramatic by comparison. "Sure," she said, and I could suddenly see right through her entirely.{&1310}\par I looked at her. Only the once, and briefly. But it was enough to lose my nerve.{&1310}\par "Forget it."{&1310}\par I just shook my head again instead, swallowed what I could of those tears, got up and locked myself in the bathroom. \cf2\f1 {&1310}\par }{&1310}

She looked like death with those bloodshot-eyes and sickly-pale, sweaty skin. I flicked it back on without saying a word. There was nothing else to do in that apartment.{&1310}\par "What time is it?" she glanced around and asked me after just sitting there with only herself for company for a while. I shook my head and shrugged without really hearing her. Or listening. We'd been stuck there for two days since we crashed into port.

I just felt tears start to well up behind my eyes.{&1310}\par "Can I ask you something?" I mumbled at her then. The sound of my own voice was tinny, and pathetic, in the open room - dark and sparsely furnished except for some clothes thrown haphazardly about in places. It made me really sad and homesick all of a sudden.{&1310}\par Tess softened so abruptly that her answer was almost dramatic by comparison. "Sure," she said, and I felt her eyes on me from the side.{&1310}\par I looked at her. Only once, and briefly. But it was enough to lose my nerve.{&1310}\par I just shook my head again instead, swallowed what I could of those tears, got up and locked myself in the bathroom. To get away from the way she sometimes shimmered like that when I looked at her. I couldn't stand it.{&1310}\par So I distracted myself by finally cleaning up and changing into something that didn't make me look like a dirty headcase. Tess tried to follow me and banged on the door a few times, but I ignored her. And an hour or so later and I could pretty much pass as normal. No trauma. No hallucinations. No dead dad.{&1310}\par I had a hard time looking at myself in the mirror.{&1310}\par When I came back out, Richter was there, bending over something on the floor. It took me a minute to realize it was that broken sculpture.{&1310}\par "My little brother made this," was all he said, looking at the pieces gathered tenatively in his hands. There wasn't any anger in his voice. It actually sounded kind of detached. He looked at me, and those crystal-blue eyes were actually sad. Then they abruptly lit up a bit.{&1310}\par "You're, ah - looking better today," he told me then.{&1310}\par "Is that it?" Tess abruptly butted in from behind, pointing at what the man had carried in under one arm.{&1310}\par "Oh. Yes." He glanced down at the bundle before holding it up for us. "They're the latest from Dreggoran, and quite popular right now."{&1310}\par "Ugh."{&1310}\par Tess made a sound in her throat as her face twisted. She unfolded the coat she'd snatched from him, looking less than happy about wearing it. It certainly didn't compare to the clothes she usually liked to throw on.{&1310}\par Richter handed me the other one and I unfolded it to see what Tess didn't like. It was long, tight-fighting, and fairly starched compared to what were used to back home. The neck was high, and it was a stark, conservative black. Plain and utilitarian, but still a little elegant with those fine scrolls on the hem you almost didn't notice. It was subtle. Not really Tess' style at all.{&1310}\par I hadn't paid much attention to Dreggoran fashion in the vids, but it seemed to fit, and most of the people I'd seen around there so far wore something similar at least. I supposed wearing those things would make us a bit less noticeable anyways. {&1310}\par "Hey, Ev ... look."{&1310}\par I glanced over at Tess having slipped into her Dreggoran coat. Or I guess that wasn't quite right. She'd done it up so tight it looked more like someone had \i stuffed \i0 her into it.{&1310}\par "Tax evasion is treason!" she stood stock still with a too-somber, too-earnest look on her spaced-out face. "All men twenty years or older must register with the DFB for mandatory enlistment!"{&1310}\par I laughed, and I couldn't help it. The image struck me so hard that I nearly doubled over, the sound bursting out of my mouth before I could catch it. Richter's face flushed bright red beneath his flaxen hair as I saw him get truly angry for the first time since I'd met him. I tried to cover my mouth to hide since I don't think he liked her impression of those government-sponsored messages they flashed around here.{&1310}\par "Sectarians!" he snapped, looking awkward even doing that like he suddenly had all that anger and wasn't sure just what to even do with it. His lip quivered as he ranted. "It might all be a big fucking joke to you, but you won't be laughing when the day comes the Grand Admirals decide to throw your part of the sector to the void."{&1310}\par He glared at us both, flushed and angry. Our laughter died down into ragged, punctuated peals. I look at Tess.{&1310}\par "What did he call us?"{&1310}\par She shrugged.{&1310}\par "I couldn't hear him over this collar!" {&1310}\par She pretened to gasp, pulling at the thing tight on her neck with her fingers. I lost it again.{&1310}\par Richter eventually had enough and stormed off to the side of the room that served as both the kitchen and dining room. Tess and I kept laughing for a bit at his expense while he downed some of that non-alcoholic tonic he seemed to love so much, looking embarassed and put off. For a few minutes, I forgot everything else that had happened, and it was just like being back home. For a few minutes.{&1310}\par Then there was a banging at the door, and everyone froze.{&1310}\par For a moment - nothing. Just me and Tess and that blonde-haired man staring with wide, surprised eyes at each other around Richter's apartment. Then:{&1310}\par "Hallo! Officer Herman Richter?"{&1310}\par The voice was brusque and soulless through the metal-paneled door. We all looked at it, and that was about it for a minute. No one had ever come to the door before. For a minute, I kind of just thought I'd imagined it.{&1310}\par "Hey!" the man on the other side shouted and pounded insistently again. "Internal Investigations Division, yeah? Open the door, please!"{&1310}\par Richter swung past us before I could blink. He looked around, hesitating, like he would figure something out from that unkempt, tiny room. Then he abruptly swept a hand back through his short hair to set it out of place before tossing the last of his tonic in his face and smearing it to a sheen. He gave us an ashen look as he walked the rest of the short way to the door, hacking into his sleeve.{&1310}\par "Yeah?" He coughed, then looked up. "Who's calling, please?"{&1310}\par Some muffled talking on the other side. There was more than one out there.{&1310}\par "Officer Richter? IID," the voice said. "Could you let us in please?"{&1310}\par "Yeah."{&1310}\par He threw a desperate hand our way, and me and Tess jumped at the bathroom door like he'd shot a gun at us. We ducked inside without making too much noise. Richter winced as Tess nearly tripped over me doing it, though. I finally got behind the door while Tess slipped into the shower stall. And I peeked out into the main room.{&1310}\par Richter kept up that fake-sick act as he punched a command into the door and opened it. I waited for whoever it was to push their way aside, but Richter just spoke to them while nodding his head weakly and coughing every so often. It was too quiet to hear, and my I got paranoid waiting. No one had come around looking for him since we'd gotten there, and I had flashes in my head of what that really meant. Internal Investigations? I could guess ...{&1310}\par My pistol was with my coat on the floor. I saw it, and felt ice pour down my back. But they were too far away to grab now.{&1310}\par I looked back at the shower stall where Tess was crouched down and peering out of the dark. She mouthed something at me, but I just shook my head without understanding.{&1310}\par How could I be so \i stupid\i0  ...?{&1310}\par When I came back around, someone else was standing in the room.{&1310}\par Richter had a coughing fit. Angry, and nerve-wracking so that he collapsed into the wall beside the man. It bought me a second or two to duck all the way out of sight while that other man took a step back, giving Richter a scornful look.{&1310}\par "Are you quite alright, Officer?" a second man demanded, stepping into the apartment. That one focused on Richter while the other was looking around. "We've had some concerns with certain discrepancies on your latest shift reports with the DMTC."{&1310}\par They both wore the same black, high-necked outfit. There was protective fiberweave built into the synthetic. I wasn't sure what that was all about. Not even the Watchmen back home needed to wear that much protection.{&1310}\par Richter just nodded, recovering himself somewhat. "I've been indisposed for some days now," he managed.{&1310}\par I could just barely keep an eye out into the room past the edge of the sliding bathroom door, but it was enough to see the first man pouring over the few belongings on the floor and scattered about. My jacket was one of them. And so were those two coats.{&1310}\par "You live alone here, Officer Richter?" he asked, glancing back. "No one else resides with you?"{&1310}\par Richter quickly shook his head, but I could tell the man already knew the answer as soon as he asked. They actually were a little like the Watchmen back home, I thought. So they probably wouldn't have come unless they already knew everything they needed to about him.{&1310}\par There was color rising in Richter's cheeks to wash away the fake-sick palor he'd been working on now.{&1310}\par "Not a - girlfriend, perhaps?" the one man was holding up my jacket. I didn't like the dead look in his eyes as he did it. It was worse than the ones I used to get back home.{&1310}\par But then the other one noticed the blood.\cf2\f1 {&1310}\par }{&1310}

I heard her puking her guts out miserably in there for the next few minutes while the man and woman onscreen droned on about the "brutal pirate attack" out in the mining town of Shtess. There were no reported survivors. That was what had had Tess up drinking all night last night.{&1310}\par When she dragged herself back out, Tess turned off the screen while pointedly refusing to look at it. She looked like death with those bloodshot-eyes and sickly-pale, sweaty skin. I flicked it back on without saying a word. There was nothing else to do in that apartment.{&1310}\par "What time is it?" she glanced around and asked me after just sitting there with only herself for company for a while. I shook my head and shrugged without really hearing her. Or listening. We'd been stuck there for two days since we crashed into port. Time lost some meaning after everything that'd happened already.{&1310}\par Tess sighed loudly next to me and hunched over, running her grimy hands up through her pink hair. She hadn't bothered to clean up since sitting in the shower yesterday for an hour with all her clothes and shoes still on. I'd found her like that, staring off into the wall long after the water had gone cold and all but shut off. She was still rank and stale from that.{&1310}\par I just kept watching the news and, eventually, she snapped at me.{&1310}\par "Ev!"{&1310}\par "What."{&1310}\par I didn't look at her until she turned off the screen again.{&1310}\par "What are we gonna do?" she demanded irritably, flipping her hand. Like it was my job to come up with something. Or either of us should have had any better idea after two days of just waiting around. {&1310}\par Again, I shook my head and shrugged. {&1310}\par I switched the screen back on.{&1310}\par And I must have pissed her off, because she picked up some ornamental carving of a warship and threw it right at it. The display was entirely holographic, though, and just warped around as it passed. The ship bounced off the wall and split into three ragged chunks on the floor.{&1310}\par I didn't look at her. I just felt tears start to well up behind my eyes.{&1310}\par "Can I ask you something?" I mumbled at her then. The sound of my own voice was tinny, and pathetic, in the open room - dark and sparsely furnished except for some clothes thrown haphazardly about in places. It made me really sad and homesick all of a sudden.{&1310}\par Tess softened so abruptly that her answer was almost dramatic by comparison. "Sure," she said, and I felt her eyes on me from the side.{&1310}\par I looked at her. Only once, and briefly. But it was enough to lose my nerve.{&1310}\par I just shook my head again instead, swallowed what I could of those tears, got up and locked myself in the bathroom. To get away from the way she sometimes shimmered like that when I looked at her. I couldn't stand it.{&1310}\par So I distracted myself by finally cleaning up and changing into something that didn't make me look like a dirty headcase. Tess tried to follow me and banged on the door a few times, but I ignored her. And an hour or so later and I could pretty much pass as normal. No trauma. No hallucinations. No dead dad.{&1310}\par I had a hard time looking at myself in the mirror.{&1310}\par When I came back out, Richter was there, bending over something on the floor. It took me a minute to realize it was that broken sculpture.{&1310}\par "My little brother made this," was all he said, looking at the pieces gathered tenatively in his hands. There wasn't any anger in his voice. It actually sounded kind of detached. He looked at me, and those crystal-blue eyes were actually sad. Then they abruptly lit up a bit.{&1310}\par "You're, ah - looking better today," he told me then.{&1310}\par "Is that it?" Tess abruptly butted in from behind, pointing at what the man had carried in under one arm.{&1310}\par "Oh. Yes." He glanced down at the bundle before holding it up for us. "They're the latest from Dreggoran, and quite popular right now."{&1310}\par "Ugh."{&1310}\par Tess made a sound in her throat as her face twisted. She unfolded the coat she'd snatched from him, looking less than happy about wearing it. It certainly didn't compare to the clothes she usually liked to throw on.{&1310}\par Richter handed me the other one and I unfolded it to see what Tess didn't like. It was long, tight-fighting, and fairly starched compared to what were used to back home. The neck was high, and it was a stark, conservative black. Plain and utilitarian, but still a little elegant with those fine scrolls on the hem you almost didn't notice. It was subtle. Not really Tess' style at all.{&1310}\par I hadn't paid much attention to Dreggoran fashion in the vids, but it seemed to fit, and most of the people I'd seen around there so far wore something similar at least. I supposed wearing those things would make us a bit less noticeable anyways. {&1310}\par "Hey, Ev ... look."{&1310}\par I glanced over at Tess having slipped into her Dreggoran coat. Or I guess that wasn't quite right. She'd done it up so tight it looked more like someone had \i stuffed \i0 her into it.{&1310}\par "Tax evasion is treason!" she stood stock still with a too-somber, too-earnest look on her spaced-out face. "All men twenty years or older must register with the DFB for mandatory enlistment!"{&1310}\par I laughed, and I couldn't help it. The image struck me so hard that I nearly doubled over, the sound bursting out of my mouth before I could catch it. Richter's face flushed bright red beneath his flaxen hair making his head look like some kind of big fruit as I saw him get truly angry for the first time since I'd met him. I tried to cover my mouth to hide since I don't think he liked her impression of those government-sponsored messages they flashed around here.{&1310}\par "Sectarians!" he snapped, looking awkward even doing that like he suddenly had all that anger and wasn't sure just what to even do with it. His lip quivered as he ranted. "It might all be a big fucking joke to you, but you won't be laughing when the day comes the Grand Admirals decide to throw your part of the sector to the void."{&1310}\par He glared at us both, flushed and angry. Our laughter died down into ragged, punctuated peals. I look at Tess.{&1310}\par "What did he call us?"{&1310}\par She shrugged.{&1310}\par "I couldn't hear him over this collar!" {&1310}\par She pretened to gasp, pulling at the thing tight on her neck with her fingers. I lost it again.{&1310}\par Richter eventually had enough and stormed off to the side of the room that served as both the kitchen and dining room. Tess and I kept laughing for a bit at his expense while he downed some of that non-alcoholic tonic he seemed to love so much, looking embarassed and put off. For a few minutes, I forgot everything else that had happened, and it was just like being back home. For a few minutes.{&1310}\par Then there was a banging at the door, and everyone froze.{&1310}\par For a moment - nothing. Just me and Tess and that blonde-haired man staring with wide, surprised eyes at each other around Richter's apartment. Then:{&1310}\par "Hallo! Officer Herman Richter?"{&1310}\par The voice was brusque and soulless through the metal-paneled door. We all looked at it, and that was about it for a minute. No one had ever come to the door before. For a minute, I kind of just thought I'd imagined it.{&1310}\par "Hey!" the man on the other side shouted and pounded insistently again. "Internal Investigations Division, yeah? Open the door, please!"{&1310}\par Richter swung past us before I could blink. He looked around, hesitating, like he would figure something out from that unkempt, tiny room. Then he abruptly swept a hand back through his short hair to set it out of place before tossing the last of his tonic in his face and smearing it to a sheen. He gave us an ashen look as he walked the rest of the short way to the door, hacking into his sleeve.{&1310}\par "Yeah?" He coughed, then looked up. "Who's calling, please?"{&1310}\par Some muffled talking on the other side. There was more than one out there.{&1310}\par "Officer Richter? IID," the voice said. "Could you let us in please?"{&1310}\par "Yeah."{&1310}\par He threw a desperate hand our way, and me and Tess jumped at the bathroom door like he'd shot a gun at us. We ducked inside without making too much noise. Richter winced as Tess nearly tripped over me doing it, though. I finally got behind the door while Tess slipped into the shower stall. And I peeked out into the main room.{&1310}\par Richter kept up that fake-sick act as he punched a command into the door and opened it. I waited for whoever it was to push their way aside, but Richter just spoke to them while nodding his head weakly and coughing every so often. It was too quiet to hear, and my I got paranoid waiting. No one had come around looking for him since we'd gotten there, and I had flashes in my head of what that really meant. Internal Investigations? I could guess ...{&1310}\par My pistol was with my coat on the floor. I saw it, and felt ice pour down my back. But they were too far away to grab now.{&1310}\par I looked back at the shower stall where Tess was crouched down and peering out of the dark. She mouthed something at me, but I just shook my head without understanding.{&1310}\par How could I be so \i stupid\i0  ...?{&1310}\par When I came back around, someone else was standing in the room.{&1310}\par Richter had a coughing fit. Angry, and nerve-wracking so that he collapsed into the wall beside the man. It bought me a second or two to duck all the way out of sight while that other man took a step back, giving Richter a scornful look.{&1310}\par "Are you quite alright, Officer?" a second man demanded, stepping into the apartment. That one focused on Richter while the other was looking around. "We've had some concerns with certain discrepancies on your latest shift reports with the DMTC."{&1310}\par They both wore the same black, high-necked outfit. There was protective fiberweave built into the synthetic. I wasn't sure what that was all about. Not even the Watchmen back home needed to wear that much protection.{&1310}\par Richter just nodded, recovering himself somewhat. "I've been indisposed for some days now," he managed.{&1310}\par I could just barely keep an eye out into the room past the edge of the sliding bathroom door, but it was enough to see the first man pouring over the few belongings on the floor and scattered about. My jacket was one of them. And so were those two coats.{&1310}\par "You live alone here, Officer Richter?" he asked, glancing back. "No one else resides with you?"{&1310}\par Richter quickly shook his head, but I could tell the man already knew the answer as soon as he asked. They actually were a little like the Watchmen back home, I thought. So they probably wouldn't have come unless they already knew everything they needed to about him.{&1310}\par There was color rising in Richter's cheeks to wash away the fake-sick palor he'd been working on now.{&1310}\par "Not a - girlfriend, perhaps?" the one man was holding up my jacket. I didn't like the dead look in his eyes as he did it. It was worse than the ones I used to get back home.{&1310}\par But then the other one noticed the blood.\cf2\f1 {&1310}\par }{&1310}
