She was putting up a brave smile - for herself, or me, I couldn't tell. She was still pretty shaken up from the whole thing. Me, I didn't know what I was supposed to be feeling right about now.{&1310}\par "I did," I said instead. And I looked right at her when I said it.{&1310}\par "Oookay. Ev. You're kinda creeping me out."{&1310}\par We were in the kitchens downstairs. Matthias was trying to keep us out of sight and grilling Julian over what had happened upstairs. It would have been me and Tess, but the Eluvian had tried to ward him off. Apparently the bartender didn't like people shooting up his bar. I'd gotten the full story straight myself only after a few minutes of listening to Tess and Julian. And it wasn't at all how I remembered it happening.{&1310}\par Some details were the same. Those two men broke into the room with Tess and tried to kill her. I must have still heard the gunshot and come running. I took down the one guy, and shot the other. But that was about it. The rest of what Tess told me was different.{&1310}\par She said she'd pulled the pistol on them when they burst in and tried to shoot her. They managed to get past her, though, and pin her to the floor. She hadn't been a good enough shot to stop them - terrible, apparently. She missed them from less than a meter away, fumbling the gun. But she'd been alive when they tried to cut off her head. Alive enough to kick the one with the cutter in the knee when I came in.{&1310}\par I had gotten them off her, just like before. I beat up the first one and disarmed him. I hadn't had my own pistol then. That was what Tess said, and she kept twisting the one I had now over and over in her hands trying to figure out how it had changed from the needle gun I took from the first guy. It was the needle gun I'd shot the other man with. And the first when he grabbed the cutter from the floor to throw at us. I hadn't cracked his head hard enough to knock him out this time.{&1310}\par That was what she told me. But that wasn't what I remembered.{&1310}\par Why wasn't that what I remembered?{&1310}\par Tess should have been dead, but she wasn't. I should have been holding her lifeless corpse, but it was gone as soon as I'd opened my eyes.{&1310}\par "Ev?"{&1310}\par I must have gone crazy. What else could it possibly be?{&1310}\par "Hey. Ev."{&1310}\par Tess' hand was on my shoulder. She was looking me in the eyes, trying to get my attention.{&1310}\par "It's going to be okay, okay?" she said with a smile for me. I could still see the terrified tears in her eyes from before. "We're okay now. We're going to be okay."{&1310}\par I just stared at her. I didn't want to tell her that she was wrong because I didn't know \i how\i0  she was wrong. I didn't understand it at all.{&1310}\par Maybe she thought \i I\i0  was the one who needed consoling. I guess I was. At least, a little bit. But I hadn't been the one who'd gotten my head cut off. And there was this little manic tick in her eye. I think she was barely holding it together.{&1310}\par Julian stalked his way back over then, looking more grim and irritated than usual. His eyes kept darting back at Matthias standing on the other side of the room.{&1310}\par "Well?" Tess blurted out when the Eluvian just stood there thinking it over for a minute without opening his mouth.{&1310}\par "He wants us gone," was what he said when he finally did. It was quiet, and low so the bartender couldn't hear. Julian gave each of us a hard once-over. "Tonight. He thinks it's our fault this happened at all."{&1310}\par There was a brief moment of silence before Tess' incredulous, "\i What\i0 ?"{&1310}\par "Apparently those two men came in here looking for you," Julian said. "He spoke to them down at the bar earlier, and told them where to find you."{&1310}\par "What-?" I started, but Tess ran right over me.{&1310}\par "He told them where we were?" {&1310}\par Tess suddenly boiled over red and blotchy white in places, fists balled and shaking down at her sides.{&1310}\par "He told them he didn't want any trouble."{&1310}\par "He \i told\i0  them!" Tess cried.{&1310}\par Julian weathered her sudden rush like a veteran.{&1310}\par "He sent those two up to our room! I mean, we just almost got \i killed\i0 ," she screeched at him. I knew she'd been trying to keep herself under control and calm, but she wasn't very good at it. And no one had ever tried to kill her before.{&1310}\par I guess that made \i me \i0 the experienced one.{&1310}\par "Now where are we supposed to go? The train doesn't leave until tomorrow night!"{&1310}\par Julian opened his mouth to say something, but she just pushed right past him.{&1310}\par "Hey! Asshole! Yeah, \i you\i0 !" she started screaming at Matthias instead. "What the fuck do you expect us to do? Just go out there and hope you don't send any other murdering psychopaths our way? No-o-o! I say we stay right here until morning and make sure you don't do another goddamned thing!"{&1310}\par The man's eyes popped at her suddenly launching at him all a-fury, but his whole face went dark when she continued on.{&1310}\par "Whaddidyou say to those guys? Tell 'em to come up and rob us? Kill us?" she stabbed a finger at his face. "Just get rid of the weirdos from space for me, okay? They're eating all my food and smelling up my room! FUCK YOU!" she snapped.{&1310}\par "Theresa!"{&1310}\par Julian snatched her arm back before the bulky Matthias could take a swing at her. I don't know if he actually would have, but he certainly looked like he could. And the way Tess was getting all up in his face all of a sudden, I wouldn't have been surprised. I couldn't be after everything that had already happened. She spun around and launched on him instead.{&1310}\par "Don't fucking call me that! Where the hell were you while those assholes were trying to gun down Ev and me? Huh! Where the hell were \i you\i0 !"{&1310}\par There was some kind of commotion outside in the main room. We all heard it as the front doors must have swung open. They hit the hinges loud enough for the sound to reach the back. A few seconds later, and the room started getting quiet as someone shouted for Matthias. Something about it took the wind right out of Tess' hysterics.{&1310}\par For a second there, I thought Julian might take a swing at her too. He looked like he might, and I wondered what I could do if he did. But Tess broke down before he could do anything like that. She collapsed into a fit full of tears and flopped away toward a counter top, burying her face there.{&1310}\par "\i Fuck\i0 !" she wailed into a hand.{&1310}\par Julian looked at her. Then Matthias. And the barkeep just stuck a finger at him.{&1310}\par "Tonight. I mean it."{&1310}\par Then the man tore away through door back toward the front.{&1310}\par "Vat!"{&1310}\par It was quiet then for us in the back. Julian came back around from staring after Matthias, slowly. He looked at me first, then Tess. But I'd just been sitting there the whole time. Watching.{&1310}\par "Where were you, Jules," came the pitiful sobbing of a sudden from Tess' direction before the Eluvian could open his mouth to say anything. "Where were you ..."{&1310}\par "Scouting your train," was his answer.{&1310}\par "What ...?"{&1310}\par Tess lifted herself back off the counter to look at him, red-eyed and a mess. Funny to see her go to pieces like that so fast, especially after trying to keep \i me\i0  from falling apart on her. But I couldn't really blame her. I couldn't.{&1310}\par I think Julian was wrapping his head around just how messed up his situation was right about then. Stuck with two young women about ready to come apart at the seams. Stranded on some moon. Murderers coming after them with guns. That thing in the woods.{&1310}\par Tess had tried to keep it together, but she cracked under how close she'd come to getting her head chopped off. And me? I didn't know what to even \i start\i0  to think about me. I was some whole other place away.{&1310}\par "I think we can get out on it," Julian offered after another pause. "You might've been right about that."{&1310}\par I didn't know if he was just trying to butter her up and calm her down or what, but it worked. A little. She swiped at her face and eyes with an arm, and started to compose herself again. She was still standing there in only a shirt and pants without shoes.{&1310}\par "Okay ..." she sniffed, and tried to laugh. "So, what do we do now?"{&1310}\par "First thing," he started again. "Those two weren't after you. Or us."{&1310}\par "What?" Tess finally listened.{&1310}\par Then he looked at me.\cf2\f2 {&1310}\par }{&1310}

The tattooed man was passed out cold beside me in the back. Tess hadn't lasted much longer up front. And that left me alone. With a waking dream flowing by in the form of sprawling forests that quickly turned to verdant, yellowed fields outside the viewport with only that old man for company.{&1310}\par The subtle, insidious whispering faded almost to nothing as we rolled away in that worn and trembling automotive. And so did the certainty that I was dead or still just dreaming. They didn't always feel so real, but that place was not so surreal as the worst my imagination had to offer when I wasn't careful.{&1310}\par Dad had come through on his promise.{&1310}\par I was planetside.{&1310}\par With that realization, though, came the one where he was dead. And I was all alone.{&1310}\par I spent the rest of that ride with only that thought in my head as I stared without seeing out the viewport. Over, and over. People said things at me. But I didn't hear them. Just Dad and those last few words in the life pod. It felt like someone had scratched them on the inside of my skull with a rusty knife.{&1310}\par That old man kept looking at me in a mirror hanging from the ceiling between him and Tess while she slept. He told me his name, but I wasn't listening. Tried to tell me a few other things too, but I didn't care. And kept winking at me with a patient look like he was expecting me to figure something out. But I had never seen him before in my life. And I didn't care if I never saw him again.{&1310}\par Tess drifted in and out. The man who had carried me through those woods didn't. Not until the day had dragged on into late afternoon and what must have been a small planetside-town sprouted up around us. The clear fields peeled back and there was just that rough-edged, rocky outcropping of humanity. White-washed, and looking disused. Walkways were pitted and corroded without cleaning. Walls cracked and crumbled in places, looking more like stone - maybe even wood - than metal. Blue atmosphere soared overhead into infinity, and the air whipped past our vehicle like it was a living thing. So wild and uncontrolled. Nothing like Riftwatch. Nothing like home.{&1310}\par A couple more tears slipped down past my cheeks.{&1310}\par We got lost amidst those buildings. A few people eyed us interestedly, but mostly because they looked dull and bored. The rest ignored us. A working colony, maybe. There were a lot of unkempt men wandering around in droves with similar, dusty dress. Laborers. Somehow, it didn't seem like the kind of place that Dad would have taken us to vacation. Not at all. {&1310}\par Not that any of it mattered anymore.{&1310}\par I might have wondered who that tattooed man was who'd carried me through the woods, but I couldn't bring myself to care. It felt too much like the weight of everything around me was just crushing inward and suffocating slowly. I wasn't tired, but I couldn't summon the nerve to more than drag my mind and body around in place. I was happy just to lay there without moving. {&1310}\par Eventually, we stopped. And that tattoed man snapped back awake like he had just been waiting the whole ride to do just that.{&1310}\par He blinked around, alert like no one else in that place, and snatching at the rifle propped up between us on the seat. His eyes settled on me for a second - I could feel them boring a hole in the side of my head as I leaned listlessly into the glass. Then, they were gone and so was he, barely muttering some gratitude to the old man before throwing his hatch open and hopping outside. The old man leaned over and woke up Tess.{&1310}\par "Where the hell are we?" she blurted out after whipping her head around at the town. She must have noticed the tattooed man hurrying away without a word, because she threw her own hatch open and shouted after him.{&1310}\par "Hey! Where are you going?"{&1310}\par Before I knew it, Tess had me yanked out of the back seat and was shouting away at that man so loud that most of the people around stopped to give us a look. We stood out apparently, because they didn't stop looking after that.{&1310}\par "Dammit! WAIT FOR US!"{&1310}\par She ducked back in for a few seconds. Then she was dragging me bodily down the gravelly way after the tattooed man. The old man took his clanking automobile, and left.{&1310}\par People stared after. Hard and hallowed faces - most of them some chalky white. The air picked up in heavy gusts flowing back from those plains behind, and kicked up dirt and dust at my feet. I stood out, but I wouldn't for very long. I tasted salt and sand on my tongue, and looked down. There was blood on my jacket. Dad's blood.{&1310}\par We reached some sort of station at some point after clawing our way down terrestrial streets with faded signs and graffiti and people that gave us a wide berth. Tess hauled me inside without another word. She shoved more than a few people as she did, pushing her way through and dragging me along with her. Now some of those looks turned hostile, and a couple shouted after her. They had a dialect I could hardly recognize. Tess just ignored them and stalked right through that place until the tattooed man came back into view.{&1310}\par The pink-haired woman starting pushing him around. She let me go, and I skittered to a halt. Those other people waiting inside the station swallowed me up and jostled me around as a space opened up for those two going at it loudly. I scrunched in on myself. I didn't want those people to touch me. There was nothing fun about any of it anymore. Now ...{&1310}\par I just wanted to go \i home\i0 .\cf2 {&1310}\par }{&1310}

Tess blurted out when the Eluvian just stood there thinking for a minute without saying anything.{&1310}\par "He wants us gone," was what he said when he finally did. It was quiet, and low so the bartender couldn't here. Julian gave each of us a hard once-over. "Tonight."{&1310}\par There was a brief moment of silence. Before Tess' incredulous, "\i What\i0 ?"{&1310}\par "He thinks it's our fault this happened at all."{&1310}\par "That's ... that's ..."{&1310}\par Tess was flailing around with her thoughts, furious and flapping an arm like she would beat the idea to death with a fist.{&1310}\par "That's \i soooo\i0  fucked \i up\i0 !"{&1310}\par Julian weathered her sudden rush like a veteran.{&1310}\par "What does he expect us to do? I mean, we just almost got \i killed\i0 ," she screeched at him of a sudden. She'd been trying to keep herself under control and calm, but she wasn't very good at it. No one had ever tried to kill her before.{&1310}\par I guess that made me the veteran{&47}experienced one.{&1310}\par "Where are we supposed to go? What are we supposed to do?"{&1310}\par Julian sighed, putting a hand up to hold her back, but she pushed right past him.{&1310}\par "Hey, asshole! What the fuck do you expect us to do!" she started screaming at Matthias instead. "Just go out there and hope no one else tries to take a shot at murdering us?"{&1310}\par The man's eyes popped at her suddenly launching at him all a-fury, but his whole face went dark when she continued on.{&1310}\par "Whaddidyou do? Tell 'em to come up and rob us? Kill us?" she stabbed a finger at his face. "Just get rid of the weirdos from space for me, okay? They're drinking all my beer! Yeah, fuck you and FUCK YOUR FUCKING BEER!" she snapped.{&1310}\par "Theresa!"{&1310}\par Julian snatched her arm back before the bulky Matthias could take a swing at her. I don't know if he actually would have, but he certainly looked like he could. And the way Tess was getting up in his face all of a sudden, I wouldn't have been surprised. She spun around and launched on him instead.{&1310}\par "Don't fucking call me that, you piece of shit! Where the hell were you while those assholes were trying to gun down Ev and me? Huh! Where the hell were \i you\i0 !"{&1310}\par There was some kind of commotion outside in the main room. We all heard it as the front doors must have swung open. They hit the hinges loud enough for the sound to reach the back. A few seconds later, and the room started getting quiet as someone shouted for Matthias. Something about it took the wind right out of Tess' hysterics.{&1310}\par For a second there, I thought Julian might take a swing at her too. He looked like he might, and I wondered what I could do if he did. But Tess broke down before he could do anything like that. She collapsed into a fit full of tears and flopped away toward a counter top, burying her face there.{&1310}\par "\i Fuck\i0 !" she wailed into a hand.{&1310}\par Julian looked at her. Then Matthias. And the barkeep just stuck a finger at him.{&1310}\par "Tonight. I mean it."{&1310}\par Then the man tore away through door back toward the front.{&1310}\par "Vat!"{&1310}\par It was quiet then for us in the back. Julian came back around from staring after Matthias, slowly. He looked at me first, then Tess. But I'd just been sitting there the whole time. Watching.{&1310}\par "Where were you, Jules," came the pitiful sobbing of a sudden from Tess' direction before the Eluvian could open his mouth to say anything. "Where were you ..."{&1310}\par "Scouting your train," was his answer.{&1310}\par "What ...?"{&1310}\par Tess lifted herself back off the counter to look at him, red-eyed and a mess. Funny to see her go to pieces like that so fast, especially after trying to keep \i me\i0  from falling apart on her. But I couldn't really blame her.{&1310}\par I think Julian was wrapping his head around just how messed up his situation was right about then. Stuck with two young women about ready to come apart at the seams. Stranded on some moon.{&1310}\par Tess had tried to keep it together, but she cracked under how close she'd come to getting her head chopped off. And me? I didn't know what to even \i start\i0  to think about me. I was some whole other place away.{&1310}\par "I think we can get out on it," Julian offered after another pause. "You might've been right about it."{&1310}\par I didn't know if he was just trying to butter her up and calm her down or what, but it worked. A little. She swiped at her face and eyes with an arm, and started to compose herself again. She was still standing there in only a shirt and pants without shoes.{&1310}\par "Okay ..." she sniffed, and tried to laugh. "So, what do we do now?"{&1310}\par "First things," he started again. "Those two weren't after you. Or us."{&1310}\par "What?"{&1310}\par Then he looked at me.\cf2\f2 {&1310}\par }{&1310}

I didn't want to tell her that she was wrong because I didn't know \i how\i0  she was wrong. I didn't understand it at all.{&1310}\par Maybe she thought \i I\i0  was the one who needed consoling. I guess I was. At least, a little bit.{&1310}\par But I hadn't been the one who'd gotten my head cut off.{&1310}\par Julian stalked his way back over then, looking more grim and irritated than usual. He had a twitch to his eyes that kept them darting back at Matthias standing on the other side of the room.{&1310}\par "Well?" Tess blurted out when the Eluvian just stood there thinking for a minute without saying anything.{&1310}\par "He wants us gone," was what he said when he finally did. It was quiet, and low so the bartender couldn't here. Julian gave each of us a hard once-over. "Tonight."{&1310}\par There was a brief moment of silence. Before Tess' incredulous, "\i What\i0 ?"{&1310}\par "He thinks it's our fault this happened at all."{&1310}\par "That's ... that's ..."{&1310}\par Tess was flailing around with her thoughts, furious and flapping an arm like she would beat the idea to death with a fist.{&1310}\par "That's \i soooo\i0  fucked \i up\i0 !"{&1310}\par Julian weathered her sudden rush like a veteran.{&1310}\par "What does he expect us to do? I mean, we just almost got \i killed\i0 ," she screeched at him of a sudden. She'd been trying to keep herself under control and calm, but she wasn't very good at it. No one had ever tried to kill her before.{&1310}\par I guess that made me the veteran{&47}experienced one.{&1310}\par "Where are we supposed to go? What are we supposed to do?"{&1310}\par Julian sighed, putting a hand up to hold her back, but she pushed right past him.{&1310}\par "Hey, asshole! What the fuck do you expect us to do!" she started screaming at Matthias instead. "Just go out there and hope no one else tries to take a shot at murdering us?"{&1310}\par The man's eyes popped at her suddenly launching at him all a-fury, but his whole face went dark when she continued on.{&1310}\par "Whaddidyou do? Tell 'em to come up and rob us? Kill us?" she stabbed a finger at his face. "Just get rid of the weirdos from space for me, okay? They're drinking all my beer! Yeah, fuck you and FUCK YOUR FUCKING BEER!" she snapped.{&1310}\par "Theresa!"{&1310}\par Julian snatched her arm back before the bulky Matthias could take a swing at her. I don't know if he actually would have, but he certainly looked like he could. And the way Tess was getting up in his face all of a sudden, I wouldn't have been surprised. She spun around and launched on him instead.{&1310}\par "Don't fucking call me that, you piece of shit! Where the hell were you while those assholes were trying to gun down Ev and me? Huh! Where the hell were \i you\i0 !"{&1310}\par There was some kind of commotion outside in the main room. We all heard it as the front doors must have swung open. They hit the hinges loud enough for the sound to reach the back. A few seconds later, and the room started getting quiet as someone shouted for Matthias. Something about it took the wind right out of Tess' hysterics.{&1310}\par For a second there, I thought Julian might take a swing at her too. He looked like he might, and I wondered what I could do if he did. But Tess broke down before he could do anything like that. She collapsed into a fit full of tears and flopped away toward a counter top, burying her face there.{&1310}\par "\i Fuck\i0 !" she wailed into a hand.{&1310}\par Julian looked at her. Then Matthias. And the barkeep just stuck a finger at him.{&1310}\par "Tonight. I mean it."{&1310}\par Then the man tore away through door back toward the front.{&1310}\par "Vat!"{&1310}\par It was quiet then for us in the back. Julian came back around from staring after Matthias, slowly. He looked at me first, then Tess. But I'd just been sitting there the whole time. Watching.{&1310}\par "Where were you, Jules," came the pitiful sobbing of a sudden from Tess' direction before the Eluvian could open his mouth to say anything. "Where were you ..."{&1310}\par "Scouting your train," was his answer.{&1310}\par "What ...?"{&1310}\par Tess lifted herself back off the counter to look at him, red-eyed and a mess. Funny to see her go to pieces like that so fast, especially after trying to keep \i me\i0  from falling apart on her. But I couldn't really blame her.{&1310}\par I think Julian was wrapping his head around just how messed up his situation was right about then. Stuck with two young women about ready to come apart at the seams. Stranded on some moon.{&1310}\par Tess had tried to keep it together, but she cracked under how close she'd come to getting her head chopped off. And me? I didn't know what to even \i start\i0  to think about me. I was some whole other place away.{&1310}\par "I think we can get out on it," Julian offered after another pause. "You might've been right about it."{&1310}\par I didn't know if he was just trying to butter her up and calm her down or what, but it worked. A little. She swiped at her face and eyes with an arm, and started to compose herself again. She was still standing there in only a shirt and pants without shoes.{&1310}\par "Okay ..." she sniffed, and tried to laugh. "So, what do we do now?"{&1310}\par "First things," he started again. "Those two weren't after you. Or us."{&1310}\par "What?"{&1310}\par Then he looked at me.\cf2\f2 {&1310}\par }{&1310}

What are we supposed to do?"{&1310}\par Julian sighed, putting a hand up to hold her back, but she pushed right past him.{&1310}\par "Hey, asshole! What the fuck do you expect us to do!" she started screaming at Matthias instead. "Just go out there and hope no one else tries to take a shot at murdering us?"{&1310}\par The man's eyes popped at her suddenly launching at him all a-fury, but his whole face went dark when she continued on.{&1310}\par "Whaddidyou do? Tell 'em to come up and rob us? Kill us?" she stabbed a finger at his face. "Just get rid of the weirdos from space for me, okay? They're drinking all my beer! Yeah, FUCK YOU!" she snapped.{&1310}\par "Theresa!"{&1310}\par Julian snatched her arm back before the bulky Matthias could take a swing at her. I don't know if he actually would have, but he certainly looked like he could. And the way Tess was getting up in his face all of a sudden, I wouldn't have been surprised. She spun around and launched on him instead.{&1310}\par "Don't fucking call me that, you piece of shit! Where the hell were you while those assholes were trying to gun down Ev and me? Huh! Where the hell were \i you\i0 !"{&1310}\par There was some kind of commotion outside in the main room. We all heard it as the front doors must have swung open. They hit the hinges loud enough for the sound to reach the back. A few seconds later, and the room started getting quiet as someone shouted for Matthias. Something about it took the wind right out of Tess' hysterics.{&1310}\par For a second there, I thought Julian might take a swing at her too. He looked like he might, and I wondered what I could do if he did. But Tess broke down before he could do anything like that. She collapsed into a fit full of tears and flopped away toward a counter top, burying her face there.{&1310}\par "\i Fuck\i0 !" she wailed into a hand.{&1310}\par Julian looked at her. Then Matthias. And the barkeep just stuck a finger at him.{&1310}\par "Tonight. I mean it."{&1310}\par Then the man tore away through door back toward the front.{&1310}\par "Vat!"{&1310}\par It was quiet then for us in the back. Julian came back around from staring after Matthias, slowly. He looked at me first, then Tess. But I'd just been sitting there the whole time. Watching.{&1310}\par "Where were you, Jules," came the pitiful sobbing of a sudden from Tess' direction before the Eluvian could open his mouth to say anything. "Where were you ..."{&1310}\par "Scouting your train," was his answer.{&1310}\par "What ...?"{&1310}\par Tess lifted herself back off the counter to look at him, red-eyed and a mess. Funny to see her go to pieces like that so fast, especially after trying to keep \i me\i0  from falling apart on her. But I couldn't really blame her.{&1310}\par I think Julian was wrapping his head around just how messed up his situation was right about then. Stuck with two young women about ready to come apart at the seams. Stranded on some moon.{&1310}\par Tess had tried to keep it together, but she cracked under how close she'd come to getting her head chopped off. And me? I didn't know what to even \i start\i0  to think about me. I was some whole other place away.{&1310}\par "I think we can get out on it," Julian offered after another pause. "You might've been right about it."{&1310}\par I didn't know if he was just trying to butter her up and calm her down or what, but it worked. A little. She swiped at her face and eyes with an arm, and started to compose herself again. She was still standing there in only a shirt and pants without shoes.{&1310}\par "Okay ..." she sniffed, and tried to laugh. "So, what do we do now?"{&1310}\par "First things," he started again. "Those two weren't after you. Or us."{&1310}\par "What?"{&1310}\par Then he looked at me.\cf2\f2 {&1310}\par }{&1310}

She was putting up a brave smile - for herself, or me, I couldn't tell. She was still pretty shaken up from the whole thing. Me, I didn't know what I was supposed to be feeling right about now.{&1310}\par "I did," I said instead. And I looked right at her when I said it.{&1310}\par "Oookay. Ev. You're kinda creeping me out."{&1310}\par We were in the kitchens downstairs. Matthias was trying to keep us out of sight and grilling Julian over what had happened upstairs. It would have been me and Tess, but the Eluvian had tried to ward him off. Apparently the bartender didn't like people shooting up his bar. I'd gotten the full story straight myself only after a few minutes of listening to Tess and Julian. And it wasn't at all how I remembered it happening.{&1310}\par Some details were the same. Those two men broke into the room with Tess and tried to kill her. I must have still heard the gunshot and come running. I took down the one guy, and shot the other. But that was about it. The rest of what Tess told me was different.{&1310}\par She said she'd pulled the pistol on them when they burst in and tried to shoot her. They managed to get past her, though, and pin her to the floor. She hadn't been a good enough shot to stop them - terrible, apparently. She missed them from less than a meter away, right in front of her. But she'd been alive when they tried to cut off her head. Alive enough to kick the one with the cutter in the knee when I came in.{&1310}\par I had gotten them off her, just like before. I beat up the first one and disarmed him. I hadn't had my own pistol then. That was what Tess said, and she kept twisting the one I had now over and over in her hands trying to figure out how it had changed from the needle gun I took from the first guy. It was the needle gun I'd shot the other man with. And the first when he grabbed the cutter from the floor to throw at us. I hadn't cracked his head hard enough to knock him out this time.{&1310}\par That was what she told me. But that wasn't what I remembered.{&1310}\par Why wasn't that what I remembered?{&1310}\par Tess should have been dead, but she wasn't. I should have been holding her lifeless corpse, but it was gone as soon as I'd opened my eyes.{&1310}\par "Ev?"{&1310}\par I must have gone crazy. What else could it possibly be?{&1310}\par "Hey. Ev."{&1310}\par Tess' hand was on my shoulder. She was looking me in the eyes, trying to get my attention.{&1310}\par "It's going to be okay, okay?" she said with a smile for me. I could still see the terrified tears in her eyes from before. "We're okay now. We're going to be okay."{&1310}\par I just stared at her. I didn't want to tell her that she was wrong because I didn't know \i how\i0  she was wrong. I didn't understand it at all.{&1310}\par Maybe she thought \i I\i0  was the one who needed consoling. I guess I was. At least, a little bit. But I hadn't been the one who'd gotten my head cut off. And there was this little manic tick in her eye. I think she was barely holding it together.{&1310}\par Julian stalked his way back over then, looking more grim and irritated than usual. He had a twitch to his eyes too. But his kept them darting back at Matthias standing on the other side of the room.{&1310}\par "Well?" Tess blurted out when the Eluvian just stood there thinking it over for a minute without opening his mouth.{&1310}\par "He wants us gone," was what he said when he finally did. It was quiet, and low so the bartender couldn't hear. Julian gave each of us a hard once-over. "Tonight. He thinks it's our fault this happened at all."{&1310}\par There was a brief moment of silence before Tess' incredulous, "\i What\i0 ?"{&1310}\par "Apparently those two men came in here looking for you," Julian said. "Specifically - \i you\i0 ." He looked right at me.{&1310}\par "What-?" I started, but Tess ran right over me.{&1310}\par "That's ... that's ..."{&1310}\par Tess was flailing around with her thoughts, furious and flapping an arm like she would beat the idea to death with a fist.{&1310}\par "That's such \i bullshit\i0 !"{&1310}\par Julian weathered her sudden rush like a veteran.{&1310}\par "What does he expect us to do? I mean, we just almost got \i killed\i0 ," she screeched at him. I knew she'd been trying to keep herself under control and calm, but she wasn't very good at it. And no one had ever tried to kill her before.{&1310}\par I guess that made \i me \i0 the experienced one.{&1310}\par "Where are we supposed to go? The train doesn't leave until tomorrow night!"{&1310}\par Julian opened his mouth to say something, but she just pushed right past him.{&1310}\par "Hey! Asshole! Yeah, \i you\i0 !" she started screaming at Matthias instead. "What the fuck do you expect us to do? Just go out there and hope no one else tries to take a shot at murdering us? Because your town is so goddamned safe I guess!"{&1310}\par The man's eyes popped at her suddenly launching at him all a-fury, but his whole face went dark when she continued on.{&1310}\par "Whaddidyou do? Tell 'em to come up and rob us? Kill us?" she stabbed a finger at his face. "Just get rid of the weirdos from space for me, okay? They're eating all my food and smelling up my room! Yeah, FUCK YOU!" she snapped.{&1310}\par "Theresa!"{&1310}\par Julian snatched her arm back before the bulky Matthias could take a swing at her. I don't know if he actually would have, but he certainly looked like he could. And the way Tess was getting all up in his face all of a sudden, I wouldn't have been surprised. I couldn't be after everything that had already happened. She spun around and launched on him instead.{&1310}\par "Don't fucking call me that, you piece of shit!
