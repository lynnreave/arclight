Right?{&1310}\par There was something in the way he was standing. I felt a cold dread come over me as he stared at Ev that way. Who ... who would do that sort of thing? To ...

A quick once-over to make sure no one was looking at me, and I pulled out my pad. I had old Weir-do's secret inbox bookmarked and shortcutted. And I breathed a small sigh when I got in without a hitch this time. He figured out I was there or changed the encryption yet.{&1310}\par There was a new message in there, already read. I opened it up.\cf2\f1 {&1310}\par }{&1310}
