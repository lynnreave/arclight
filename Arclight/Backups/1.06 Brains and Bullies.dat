The other one held me fast, crushing me into the bulkhead.{&1310}\par He got closer, and I swung my feet as hard and fast as I could. He wasn't that worried about me, though, because I managed to knick one of my shoes with the sharp-end of that knife. And it slipped out of his hand.{&1310}\par "God damnit."{&1310}\par The steel clattered down into the floor. He went after it. And he was on his hands and knees for a few seconds before the other one got impatient.{&1310}\par "What the fuck did you do?"{&1310}\par "Wasn't me, asshole. The bitch kicked it down through the grates. I can't reach it."{&1310}\par "Well, get it!"{&1310}\par "Shut the fuck up! I'm trying."{&1310}\par That one man was straining an arm into the drainage gutters in the deck. Apparently, it wasn't doing him much good.{&1310}\par "Fuck!" He slapped the ground with both hands.{&1310}\par The other one laughed.{&1310}\par "Be funny if we made her go get it. Kind of ironic, don't you think?"{&1310}\par "Shut the hell up. I'm not letting her get my knife."{&1310}\par "Oh, well," the first said. "Learned a few tricks from this place anyways."{&1310}\par He reeled back, and threw his hand forward. Before I even knew what was happening, I was hurtling away down the corridor into the black.{&1310}\par I screamed again before I hit the ground. It was too dark to see it coming and, for a moment, it felt like I was falling down a hole. Maybe I was. But then my shoulder hit metal, and I twisted over into the side of my face.{&1310}\par "Hey, what the fuck did you do that for?" echoed down after me, bouncing angrily off the walls.{&1310}\par "What? It's more fun this way. Come on."{&1310}\par Footsteps. I choked up some blood or something on the floor, and pushed myself up on my elbows. They were scraped up, but I couldn't feel it. My chest and ribs hurt most.{&1310}\par Somehow, I got my legs folded underneath me. My knees were still okay, and I climbed up on top of them until I was hunched over, unsteady on my feet. I cradled my side with one hand, and looked back.{&1310}\par Those two were taking their time. One of them kicked one of my bags out of the way, skipping a step.

Version Backup 2012-05-04¶{\rtf1\ansi\ansicpg1252\deff0{\fonttbl{\f0\fnil\fcharset0 High Tower Text;}}{&1310}{\colortbl ;\red128\green128\blue128;}{&1310}\viewkind4\uc1\pard\fi720\sl480\slmult1\cf1\lang1033\f0\fs22 {&1310}\par The shuttlebay was Riftwatch's lifeline to the rest of the system. Food, water, electrical parts, perennium - it all came through there in shipments every day. There was always a shift on duty, loading and unloading. Anyone who came and went to the station had to do so by shuttle. There was no other way. So even if dad wasn't there now ... he would be.{&1310}\par I took the quickest way there. After growing up there it was hard not to know every causeway and bulkhead like the back of my hand. The scholars were out and about, though. Maybe someone else would have made the mistake, but not me. The fastest route to the shuttle was also the one no one ever used.{&1310}\par Besides Tess and me, of course.{&1310}\par I hit the gutters of the gardens and made a beeline for the bays on the other side of the station. Bags and all. It was just a straight shot through the access tunnels above the old catacombs to the shuttles. I shouldn't have known the combination to the  hatch at the end. But Tess had picked up a few tricks over the years. Not a lot of doors could keep her out for long.{&1310}\par It was dark down there. Emergency lighting wires lined the corners of the desk and ceiling, but they weren't much help. I might have had to be more careful if all my luggage didn't make me so slow already. As it was, I could barely move fast enough to keep my shoes from getting caught in shallow pools of coolant. Maybe the biggest reason no one ever came down there but Ressler.{&1310}\par At least, that's what I thought.{&1310}\par Footsteps.{&1310}\par I slowed, spinning around but still moving. It was too dim to see much behind. I looked back forward, but that was no good either. The dingy walls bounced the sound around so much I couldn't tell which way it came from. And it stopped before I could. I was alone again in the dark.{&1310}\par It was nothing. I tried to tell myself that. It was too easy to imagine something down there. The place had always given me the creeps. Tess too, though she wouldn't ever say so. It wasn't much comfort knowing a bunch of rotting old corpses were wrapped up and entombed under foot. And they had been there long before I was even born.{&1310}\par I picked up speed again. As much as I could. As much for my imagination as the idea that dad might just be sitting there waiting for me on the other side. I still couldn't believe I hadn't thought about it sooner.{&1310}\par He always liked to see if I could figure things out for myself. Especially when he \i knew\i0  I'd get it wrong the first time. {&1310}\par I stopped. There it was again. I was sure of it this time. Footsteps. Coming from ... behind.{&1310}\par "Who's there?"{&1310}\par I called out back down the tunnel. I didn't think to keep quiet, not with all my bags banging around. It wasn't like I could hide. I really just hoped it wasn't who I thought it was.{&1310}\par "Ressler?"{&1310}\par I guess he was smarter than I thought. Or hated me more than I thought. Either way, there wasn't anywhere to go now. I couldn't outrun him down there.{&1310}\par He was close now, and I could see him against the dim light lines, moving on me. I must have pissed him off real bad this time. He wasn't slowing down.{&1310}\par "Hey! I'm sorry, okay? I didn't mean to-"{&1310}\par That shape split into two. I fell back a step in surprise. But neither of those two said anything. They were just charging down that corridor like I wasn't standing right in the middle of it. I think they would have run me over too. I don't know. But they finally slowed when they were almost on top of me.{&1310}\par "Okay ..." I backed up again, trying to put some more space between us. They moved to either side, blocking the way back. "Just ... just ..."{&1310}\par I wasn't really sure what to say.{&1310}\par Not that it mattered.{&1310}\par "Well, well, what do we have here then?" one of the shadows abruptly spoke. I got a glimmer of a face. Human, at least. Not some walking corpse. They got close enough that I could almost just make them out in the shallow light.{&1310}\par "Weir-do's little girl, yeah?" the second one said, slipping a little further to one side and in behind me. "Looks like you're a little lost down here by yourself."{&1310}\par Now they had me boxed in. The tunnels weren't so wide, and I twisted sideways to keep away. For some reason, I really didn't want either of them touching me.{&1310}\par "Not so dangerous, huh?" the first said, around behind me now. They kept circling. And I cringed at each pass.{&1310}\par "Am I supposed to know you?" I snapped back at them, not sound \i nearly\i0  as angry as I hoped. It just came out shaky and scared instead. And I had to duck one of them that got too close for it.{&1310}\par "No, I don't believe you do," one of them said. I couldn't keep track anymore, not that it mattered. "Spent a couple months here now and noticed you don't seem to pay much attention to anything. Bet you wouldn't even remember if you did."{&1310}\par "We won't be here long," the other chimed in, "so it doesn't matter. You won't be here long either," he added with a laugh, "so it really matters even less. Just thought we'd have a look at you one more time. Pretty face ..."{&1310}\par "I don't see what the fuss is about," came again from behind, "but it doesn't matter. We get your skull," he explained with a sporting cant of his head. "And we're set for life."{&1310}\par "W-what?" I choked. And froze there in place.{&1310}\par I almost didn't hear it. The Voidtongue. Not until it hit me full force from the side.{&1310}\par Invisible hands snatched me right up off the ground and threw me sideways into the wall. My bags fell. I screamed too, but it was short-lived. The damp bulkhead smashing in my ribs cut me off quickly enough.{&1310}\par And then I just hung there.{&1310}\par One of those two stalked up to me. He had a hand up, and I recognized the subtle glimmer at his fingertips. There was a whiff of bared teeth and a rictus grin in the low light as he looked up at me.{&1310}\par "I'll make this quite simple for you," he snarled at me, looking pleased. His fingers twitched, and I slid up the wall just a little higher. "Plainly put, it's our job to end your life."{&1310}\par The other one barked a laugh.{&1310}\par "Taking you means a little respect among our peers, and a lot of bancors in pocket," he said, slipping something from his coat into hand. There was the glint of steel in the dark. "So you see, you can do very little, except ... die."{&1310}\par He came at me with a knife. Slowly. My feet started kicking wildly. Eyes wide, those grins grew wider at what must have been a look of absolute terror on my face. Not that I could help it. The other one held me fast, crushing me into the bulkhead.{&1310}\par He got closer, and I swung my feet as hard and fast as I could.

And he was on his hands and knees for a few seconds before the other one got impatient.{&1310}\par "What the fuck did you do?"{&1310}\par "Wasn't me, asshole. The bitch kicked it down through the grates. I can't reach it."{&1310}\par "Well, get it!"{&1310}\par "Shut the fuck up! I'm trying."{&1310}\par That one man was straining an arm into the drainage gutters in the deck. Apparently, it wasn't doing him much good.{&1310}\par "Fuck!" He slapped the ground with both hands.{&1310}\par The other one laughed.{&1310}\par "Be funny if we made her go get it. Kind of ironic, don't you think?"{&1310}\par "Shut the hell up. I'm not letting her get my knife."{&1310}\par "Oh, well," the first said. "Learned a few tricks from this place anyways."{&1310}\par He reeled back, and threw his hand forward.
