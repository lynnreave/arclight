My body turned sluggishly in the dark. But it wasn't until I saw the dull, wavering glow of emergency lights that I remembered where I was and that I hadn't suddenly woken up in the middle of vacuum.{&1310}\par How could that even happen, anyways? I'd never have woken up at all-{&1310}\par Then I remembered. Those things. That woman's corpse. Hiding right underneath them.{&1310}\par I twisted back around. Somehow, I had drifted out into the open but I wasn't hacked to pieces or half-eaten or-{&1310}\par That woman's ripped open corpse was body. I looked for it, frantically, for a few seconds. But there was nothing. The corridor was empty and quiet beside me. No howling or eating.{&1310}\par Dad. He was alive! He'd spoken to me -- I remembered that much too, and grimaced at the memory of white hot pain inside my head. He'd never done that before. I'd never heard of \i anyone\i0  actually doing that before. Not without a cybernetic implant. Not direct mind-to-mind telepathy. It was just a theory people like him liked to argue about back and forth in research papers to each other, but-{&1310}\par He'd told me to come to him.{&1310}\par ... how the \i hell\i0  was I supposed to do \i that\i0 ?{&1310}\par My head still ached and the pulsing glow of the emergency lights was making it worse. I remembered my head moving on its own and I suddenly wondered if it hadn't actually been me doing it after all. That was a terrifying thought. A little less so because of everything else, but I could still wonder. If dad could do that ... why did he ever let me get away with anything? Why did he ever let \i anyone\i0  get away with ...{&1310}\par I shivered all over, feeling strangely violated. I tried not to think about how I might have just been worked like a puppet by someone inside my own head. By dad.{&1310}\par It was hard, but I had enough terrible things to be worried about right now to just keep moving. The temptation to duck under and just hide again was really strong, though. So was the need to escape. To reach dad. I managed to focus on the latter and swim back out into the corridor.{&1310}\par \i Which way?\i0 {&1310}\par I looked back the way I'd come. Those things had gone that way. And the lights were playing tricks -- fading in and out slightly like they were on their last cells and would be totally dark soon. An even scarier thought. The other way was empty, and just as nondescript except for that wrecked door I knew was floating somewhere down there. Who knew what else was hiding back the way those monsters had come.{&1310}\par I looked back and forth. I couldn't decide which was worse, and it didn't help that they looked so eerily tame and quiet right now. Like that moment in the vids right before something jumped out and ate one of the dumb people wandering around some horrifying place where they shouldn't have ever been. {&1310}\par \i Me\i0 .{&1310}\par And the possibility of actually getting eaten was way too real right now.{&1310}\par "Tell me," I whispered out into the dark. I don't know who too, but I couldn't decide for myself. Flashes in my head of equally terrible fates were all I got in response. That voice that had yelled at me and told me where to hide? Or dad? Were they the same person, or was I just going crazy here by myself?{&1310}\par No one answered me. I waited. It didn't help that everything was still and quiet just like nothing could go wrong. And it also didn't help that the emergency lights were apparently dying out behind me.{&1310}\par I turned right. The darkness swallowing me whole decided me. I wasn't going to be completely blind down there. \i Half\i0 -blind was more than enough-{&1310}\par Wait.{&1310}\par I turned my head back around before I started off. That slowly pulsing glow was behind me, jumping from one bank of red lights to another. I stared at them along the edges of the corridor leading back and something really far-fetched started to dawn on me then.{&1310}\par \i Worse than Tau monsters suddenly running around loose and eating people here on one of the most guarded stations in the sector?\i0 {&1310}\par How could he even ...{&1310}\par No. He couldn't.{&1310}\par Could he?{&1310}\par The trail of wavering lights ended right where my hiding spot was. Where that woman had been eaten on top of me. Where dad had spoken to me.{&1310}\par The ones further on weren't showing any signs of dying.{&1310}\par I looked at the lights, throbbing back down the way I had come and wondered if that couldn't just be coincidence. I'm pretty sure they hadn't been doing that before either, but ...{&1310}\par \i God\i0  ... \i dad\i0  ...{&1310}\par I started back that way almost without realizing it.{&1310}\par \i Please, please, please let this be you\i0 , I thought desperately. {&1310}\par \i Somehow \i0 ...{&1310}\par I swam down the hall -- back the way I came, grabbing the sides of the bulkheads and pushing myself along. That glowing trail made the shimmering dark even creepier. It faded out and I kept waiting for some inky-black shape to be looming there when it flashed its brightest again. I wondered if dad even knew about what I'd found in here. About what had killed all these people. Maybe everyone in the entire research tower.{&1310}\par \i Don't think about it\i0 .{&1310}\par I tried not to. I tried to focus on pushing forward, eyes darting about and hands trembling as they grasped steel alloys jutting out in whatever slopes they came across. I wondered if my body would run out of adrenaline and quit before I got where dad was taking me, assuming he was taking me anywhere at all. I wondered where those things had gotten themselves to after chasing me into hiding.{&1310}\par It was quiet and I felt a sharp pain in my stomach. One hand snaked dwon there and found my coat sliced open to the skin where a big gash was trickling blood out into the weightless air in sticky little droplets. I'd forgotten about that cut. And now it stung like hell and I couldn't stop thinking about it. Was I going to bleed out? {&1310}\par \i Probably not. \i0 {&1310}\par \i Does it matter? Really? \i0 {&1310}\par I just pushed on.{&1310}\par I hadn't been up to the research towers much before and my memory for directions was terrible so even without the lights being off I would've had a problem figuring out where to go. The rest of the deck was sealed off, though, right? So where could dad be taking me? If it was even really him, and not some creepy hallucination like a delirium mirage or someting. This whole place looked more like something out of my nightmares than a part of the home I'd known for twenty years. But ... those dreams had never last this long before.{&1310}\par And when they felt this real it'd neveen \i my\i0  eyes I'd been seeing it through. It'd always been that soldier -- Brennan's. And he sure as hell didn't fumble around terrified and completely helpless like I did. Even when he was scared -- and he usually was -- he'd always managed some sort of calm. Not like me.{&1310}\par It was quiet still as I found my way back to where I had first seen that monster in the hallways, eating corpses -- I think. The lights led on, though. And I didn't see any corpses now. All those torn up pieces seemed like they'd just put themselves back together and wandered off.{&1310}\par I shivered and cringed at that sudden image inside my head.{&1310}\par But the blood was still there, splattered all around as far as I could tell. I hadn't just imagined it. Not that I wouldn't have minded this time.{&1310}\par I slowed down but kept swimming on. It didn't matter. Nothing mattered now but following dad's trail and finall getting the hell out of here. {&1310}\par It was the missing marines that made me stop again.{&1310}\par The flashing trail led on. I wondered for what must have been the dozenth time whether I was just imagining it. What if I was wrong? Cold sweat was on my palms, trickling down my neck. Clumps of wet hair drifted into my face and I had to resist the urge to spit them out -- to make \i any\i0  noise at all. I thought I'd heard something too.{&1310}\par The marines bodies were gone just like the other ones. Could they have been eaten so fast? I cringed and felt my skin try to crawl up my back. How long had I been out? How long since those things had left me behind?{&1310}\par I didn't know.{&1310}\par Did the air taste more stale than before? I thought so. They weren't recycling it. They were just going to leave me to asphyxiate here with the Tau monsters. Did those things even breathe? And where were the people who brough them here? Maybe dad was the only one left alive on the whole station!{&1310}\par I stared at blood stains and dead, discarded and shredded weapons and bits of armor for a long time, daring the dark to move. At least then I'd know where those things had gone. At least then I'd know it was over.{&1310}\par "There."{&1310}\par I nearly gasped aloud before I could catch myself. The small sound that escaped was deafening in the silence. I slapped a hand over my mouth and waited for something to move -- something, \i anything\i0 ! I hadn't been the one who spoke, though.{&1310}\par Nothing happened. Then I got this feeling in the back of my head and my eyes moved sideways toward the wall. There was something sticking out of it. I was staring right at it now.{&1310}\par I reached out on instinct and grabbed that thing. A knife. It was a serrated combat knife. Probably from one of those dead marines that had vanished. Blood dripped along the molecular edge and I wondered whose it was. I doubted it was from one of the black things.{&1310}\par The trail pulled me on, finally, and I swam slowly along with that knife in front of me now. It wasn't a pulse rifle but it felt a hell of a lot better than my bare hands just then. The halls stayed quiet but I didn't to creep along much longer.{&1310}\par The trail finally came to a stop.{&1310}\par At an emergency airlock.{&1310}\par "Fu-"{&1310}\par I opened my mouth to swear at that without thinking. Thankfully, I did think, because I caught myself before I could make a noise. I had a sort of surreal moment then -- wondering out of sync with the deadly carnage around and behind me -- when had I started swearing so much? I didn't used to. Not before ... the academy, that's right. Everyone had sworn there like it was just part of the routine. Fucking whatever.{&1310}\par I stared at the big, metal hatch sanding between me and empty vacuum in dismay.{&1310}\par \i What does he want me to do? Jump out there and kill myself?\i0 {&1310}\par I could space this entire level -- including all those monsters from Tau, or wherever the hell they'd come from. There were worse ways to die, I guess. I know -- I'd seen them all just in the last hour.{&1310}\par Wait ... no. \i Screw \i0 that! That was actually probably the \i worst\i0  way I could think of to freaking die! I'd have rather have taken my chances with getting pulled apart and dismembered than blown out into space. Thanks, dad!{&1310}\par I turned back around like I meant to do just that. I dont't know what I meant to do. Why would dad bring me to the airlock?{&1310}\par I wasn't thinking straight. I mean, how could I be fucking thinking straight with everything going on! I forced myself to take a few breaths, though. I'm not sure if it helped, but it did get me to turn away from the dead, empty corridor behind. Then -- I got it.{&1310}\par Emergency suits.{&1310}\par It was so simple I could have slapped myself. So I did. I was so strung out my whole body was slightly shaking and I slapped myself across one side of my face to make it stop.{&1310}\par "Stop it! Fucking -- just stop it!"{&1310}\par It worked. A little.{&1310}\par I reached for the inner airlock door and pushed my face up against the port so I could see inside. There were gear lockers. If I twisted all the way to the right side of the hole, I could see them inside to the other side. Only one suit was missing and it didn't take me long to figure out where it had gone. There was another dead guy, face down on the floor with it pulled halfway on.{&1310}\par The outer airlock door was sealed shut still and that was all I cared about. I could stomach one more dead body to get out of here. So I punched the door release.{&1310}\par Yellow warning lights stabbed out in bolts along the bulkheads around me, and the door hissed in preparation for release. Those lights must have been on the main power circuit, though, because they flickered and died out real quick. Weird that they weren't just dead already, but that left me using the manual release to open the door the rest of the way. The whole while I kept looking back over my shoulder to the dark behind, except this time that flash of light had killed my darkvision and left spots floating in the black I couldn't trust to not be real. I ducked inside and didn't settle down until after I'd closed the door again and watched nothing move out there for a good minute through the porthole.{&1310}\par I probably should've been paying attention to what lay ahead, though. That dead guy on the floor. There was a subtle, almost imperceptible feeling of dread that I could feel somewhere in the back of my head. But it wasn't the biggest concern on my mind just then. I found one of the gear lockers with a suit in it, stripped down, suited up, and activated it. It was pretty much the same as the ones we used in training and I had plenty of practice getting yelled at to get changed over into those fast. Small favors.{&1310}\par With the hatch closed behind me I wasn't so worried about anything except getting the hell out of there -- crawling along the outside of the station in vacuum if need be. That creeping fear of being out in the black without any safety lines, instructors, or support was getting squashed by the much bigger fear of being left in this part of the station with those things. Those body-dicing, corpse-chewing, black-as-void ... \i things\i0 . I ... I didn't know what I was going to do when I got back to actual, living people again. I actually started to \i think\i0  about getting back to living people again. And that was the start.{&1310}\par So I didn't notice when that dead body on the floor first started to move.\cf2\f1 {&1310}\par }{&1310}

If I twisted all the way to the right side o\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 {&1310}f the hole, I could see them inside to the other side.

So I punched the door release.{&1310}\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Yellow warning lights stabbed out in bolts along the bulkheads around me, and the door hissed, getting ready to open.

That dead guy o\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 {&1310}n the floor. There was a subtle, almost imperceptible feeling of dread that I could feel somewhere in the back of my head. But it wasn't the biggest concern on my mind just then.

That glowing trail made the shimmering dark even creepier. It faded out and I kept waiting for some inky-black shape to be looming there when it flashed its brightest again.

I just pushed on.{&1310}\par I hadn't been up to the research towers much before and my memory for directions was terrible so even without the lights being off I would've had a problem figuring out where to go.

I tried not to think about how I might have just been worked like a puppet by someone inside my head.

Thankfully, I did think, because I caught myself before I could make a noise. I had a sort of surreal moment then -- wondering out of sync with the deadly carnage around and behind me -- when had I started swearing so much? I didn't used to. Not before ... the academy, that's right. Everyone had sworn there like it was just part of the routine. Fucking whatever.{&1310}\par I stared at the big, metal hatch sanding between me and empty vacuum in dismay.{&1310}\par \i What does he want me to do? Jump out there and kill myself?\i0 {&1310}\par I could space this entire level -- including all those monsters from Tau, or wherever the hell they'd come from. There were worse ways to die, I guess. I know -- I'd seen them all just in the last hour.{&1310}\par Wait ... no. \i Screw \i0 that! That was actually probably the \i worst\i0  way I could think of to freaking die! I'd have rather have taken my chances with getting pulled apart and dismembered than blown out into space. Thanks, dad!{&1310}\par I turned back around like I meant to do just that. I dont't know what I meant to do. Why would dad bring me to the airlock?{&1310}\par I wasn't thinking straight. I mean, how could I be fucking thinking straight with everything going on! I forced myself to take a few breaths, though. I'm not sure if it helped, but it did get me to turn away from the dead, empty corridor behind. Then -- I got it.{&1310}\par Emergency suits.{&1310}\par It was so simple I could have slapped myself. So I did. I was so strung out my whole body was slightly shaking and I slapped myself across one side of my face to make it stop.{&1310}\par "Stop it! Fucking -- just stop it!"{&1310}\par It worked. A little.{&1310}\par I reached for the inner airlock door and pushed my face up against the port so I could see inside. There were gear lockers. If I twisted all the way to the right side of the hole, I could see them inside to the other side. Only one suit was missing and it didn't take me long to figure out where it had gone. There was another dead guy, face down on the floor with it pulled halfway on.{&1310}\par The outer airlock door was sealed shut still and that was all I cared about. I could stomach one more dead body to get out of here. So I punched the door release.{&1310}\par Yellow warning lights stabbed out in bolts along the bulkheads around me, and the door hissed in preparation for release. Those lights must have been on the main power circuit, though, because they flickered and died out real quick. Weird that they weren't just dead already, but that left me using the manual release to open the door the rest of the way. The whole while I kept looking back over my shoulder to the dark behind, except this time that flash of light had killed my darkvision and left spots floating in the black I couldn't trust to not be real. I ducked inside and didn't settle down until after I'd closed the door again and watched nothing move out there for a good minute through the porthole.{&1310}\par I probably should've been paying attention to what lay ahead, though. That dead guy on the floor. There was a subtle, almost imperceptible feeling of dread that I could feel somewhere in the back of my head. But it wasn't the biggest concern on my mind just then. I found one of the gear lockers with a suit in it, stripped down, suited up, and activated it. It was pretty much the same as the ones we used in training and I had plenty of practice getting yelled at to get changed over into those fast. Small favors.{&1310}\par With the hatch closed behind me I wasn't so worried about anything except getting the hell out of there -- crawling along the outside of the station in vacuum if need be. That creeping fear of being out in the black without any safety lines, instructors, or support was getting squashed by the much bigger fear of being left in this part of the station with those things. Those body-dicing, corpse-chewing, black-as-void ... \i things\i0 . I ... I didn't know what I was going to do when I got back to actual, living people again.

My body turned sluggishly in the dark. But it wasn't until I saw the dull, wavering glow of emergency lights that I remembered where I was and that I hadn't suddenly woken up in the middle of vacuum.{&1310}\par How could that even happen, anyways? I'd never have woken up at all-{&1310}\par Then I remembered. Those things. That woman's corpse. Hiding right underneath them.{&1310}\par I twisted back around. Somehow, I had drifted out into the open but I wasn't hacked to pieces or half-eaten or-{&1310}\par That woman's ripped open corpse was gone. I looked for it, frantically, for a few seconds. But there was nothing. The corridor was empty and quiet beside me. No howling or eating.{&1310}\par Dad. He was alive! He'd spoken to me -- I remembered that much too, and grimaced at the memory of white hot pain inside my head. He'd never done that before. I'd never heard of \i anyone\i0  actually doing that before. Not without a cybernetic implant. Not direct mind-to-mind telepathy. It was just a theory people like him liked to argue about back and forth in research papers to each other, but-{&1310}\par He'd told me to come to him.{&1310}\par ... how the \i hell\i0  was I supposed to do \i that\i0 ?{&1310}\par My head still ached and the pulsing glow of the emergency lights was making it worse. I remembered my head moving on its own and I suddenly wondered if it hadn't actually been me doing it after all. That was a terrifying thought. A little less so because of everything else, but I could still wonder. If dad could do that ... why did he ever let me get away with anything? Why did he ever let \i anyone\i0  get away with ...{&1310}\par I shivered all over, feeling strangely violated. I tried not to think about how I might have just been worked like a puppet by someone inside my own head. By dad.{&1310}\par It was hard, but I had enough terrible things to be worried about right now to just keep moving. The temptation to duck under and just hide again was really strong, though. So was the need to escape. To reach dad. I managed to focus on the latter and swim back out into the corridor.{&1310}\par \i Which way?\i0 {&1310}\par I looked back the way I'd come. Those things had gone that way. And the lights were playing tricks -- fading in and out slightly like they were on their last cells and would be totally dark soon. An even scarier thought. The other way was empty, and just as nondescript except for that wrecked door I knew was floating somewhere down there. Who knew what else was hiding back the way those monsters had come.{&1310}\par I looked back and forth. I couldn't decide which was worse, and it didn't help that they looked so eerily tame and quiet right now. Like that moment in the vids right before something jumped out and ate one of the dumb protagonists. {&1310}\par \i Me\i0 .{&1310}\par And the possibility of actually getting eaten was way too real right now.{&1310}\par "Tell me," I whispered out into the dark. I don't know who too, but I couldn't decide for myself. Flashes in my head of equally terrible fates were all I got in response. That voice that had yelled at me and told me where to hide? Or dad? Were they the same person, or was I just going crazy here by myself?{&1310}\par No one answered me. I waited. It didn't help that everything was still and quiet just like nothing could go wrong. And it also didn't help that the emergency lights were apparently dying out behind me.{&1310}\par I turned right. The darkness swallowing me whole decided me. I wasn't going to be completely blind down there. Half-blind was enough-{&1310}\par Wait.{&1310}\par I turned my head back around before I started off. That slowly pulsing glow was behind me, jumping from one bank of red lights to another. I stared at them along the edges of the corridor leading back.{&1310}\par \i How could he even \i0 ...{&1310}\par No. He couldn't.{&1310}\par Could he?{&1310}\par The trail of wavering lights ended right where my hiding spot was. Where that woman had been eaten on top of me. Where dad had spoken to me.{&1310}\par The ones further on weren't showing any signs of dying.{&1310}\par I looked at the lights, throbbing back down the way I had come and wondered if that could just be coincidence. I'm pretty sure they hadn't been doing that before either, but ...{&1310}\par \i God\i0 , \i dad\i0  ...{&1310}\par I started back that way almost without realizing it.{&1310}\par \i Please, please, please let this be you\i0 , I thought desperately. {&1310}\par \i Somehow \i0 ...{&1310}\par I swam down the hall -- back the way I came, grabbing the sides of the bulkheads and pushing myself along. That glowing trail made the shimmering dark even creepier. It faded out and I kept waiting for some inky-black shape to be looming there when it flashed its brightest again. I wondered if dad even knew about what I'd found in here. About what had killed all these people. Maybe everyone in the entire research tower.{&1310}\par \i Don't think about it\i0 .{&1310}\par I tried not to. I tried to focus on pushing forward, eyes darting about and hands trembling as they grasped steel alloys jutting out in whatever slopes they came across. I wondered if my body would run out of adrenaline and quit before I got where dad was taking me. I wondered where those things had gotten themselves to after chasing me into hiding.{&1310}\par It was quiet and I felt a sharp pain in my stomach. One hand snaked dwon there and found my coat sliced open to the skin where a big gash was trickling blood out into the weightless air in sticky little droplets. I'd forgotten about that cut. And now it stung like hell and I couldn't stop thinking about it. Was it going to bleed out? I didn't think so. Did it matter? Really? I just pushed on.{&1310}\par I hadn't been up to the research towers much before and my memory for directions was terrible so even without the lights being off I would've had a problem figuring out where to go. The rest of the deck was sealed off, though, right? So where could dad be taking me? If it was even really him, and not some creepy hallucination like a delirium mirage or someting. This whole place looked more like something out of my nightmares than a part of the home I'd known for twenty years. But ... those dreams had never last this long before.{&1310}\par And when they felt this real it'd neveen \i my\i0  eyes I'd been seeing it through. It'd always been that soldier -- Brennan's. And he sure as hell didn't fumble around terrified and completely helpless like I did. Even when he was scared -- and he usually was -- he'd always managed some sort of calm. Not like me.{&1310}\par It was quiet still as I found my way back to where I had first seen that monster in the hallways, eating corpses -- I think. The lights led on, though. And I didn't see any corpses now. All those torn up pieces seemed like they'd just put themselves back together and wandered off.{&1310}\par I shivered and cringed at that sudden image inside my head.{&1310}\par But the blood was still there, splattered all around as far as I could tell. I hadn't just imagined it. Not that I wouldn't have minded this time.{&1310}\par I slowed down but kept swimming on. It didn't matter. Nothing mattered now but following dad's trail and finall getting the hell out of here. {&1310}\par It was the missing marines that made me stop again.{&1310}\par The flashing trail led on. I wondered for what must have been the dozenth time whether I was just imagining it. What if I was wrong? Cold sweat was on my palms, trickling down my neck. Clumps of wet hair drifted into my face and I had to resist the urge to spit them out -- to make \i any\i0  noise at all. I thought I'd heard something too.{&1310}\par The marines bodies were gone just like the other ones. Could they have been eaten so fast? I cringed and felt my skin try to crawl up my back. How long had I been out? How long since those things had left me behind?{&1310}\par I didn't know.{&1310}\par Did the air taste more stale than before? I thought so. They weren't recycling it. They were just going to leave me to asphyxiate here with the Tau monsters. Did those things even breathe? And where were the people who brough them here? Maybe dad was the only one left alive on the whole station!{&1310}\par I stared at blood stains and dead, discarded and shredded weapons and bits of armor for a long time, daring the dark to move. At least then I'd know where those things had gone. At least then I'd know it was over.{&1310}\par "There."{&1310}\par I nearly gasped aloud before I could catch myself. The small sound that escaped was deafening in the silence. I slapped a hand over my mouth and waited for something to move -- something, \i anything\i0 ! I hadn't been the one who spoke, though.{&1310}\par Nothing happened. Then I got this feeling in the back of my head and my eyes moved sideways toward the wall. There was something sticking out of it. I was staring right at it now.{&1310}\par I reached out on instinct and grabbed that thing. A knife. It was a serrated combat knife. Probably from one of those dead marines that had vanished. Blood dripped along the molecular edge and I wondered whose it was. I doubted it was from one of the black things.{&1310}\par The trail pulled me on, finally, and I swam slowly along with that knife in front of me now. It wasn't a pulse rifle but it felt a hell of a lot better than my bare hands just then. The halls stayed quiet but I didn't to creep along much longer.{&1310}\par The trail finally came to a stop.{&1310}\par At an emergency airlock.{&1310}\par "Fu-"{&1310}\par I opened my mouth to swear at that without thinking. Thankfully, I did think, because I caught myself before I could make a noise. I had a sort of surreal moment then -- wondering out of sync with the deadly carnage around and behind me -- when had I started swearing so much? I didn't used to. Not before ... the academy, that's right. Everyone had sworn there like it was just part of the routine. Fucking whatever.{&1310}\par I stared at the big, metal hatch sanding between me and empty vacuum in dismay.{&1310}\par \i What does he want me to do? Jump out there and kill myself?\i0 {&1310}\par I could space this entire level -- including all those monsters from Tau, or wherever the hell they'd come from. There were worse ways to die, I guess. I know -- I'd seen them all just in the last hour.{&1310}\par Wait ... no. \i Screw \i0 that! That was actually probably the \i worst\i0  way I could think of to freaking die! I'd have rather have taken my chances with getting pulled apart and dismembered than blown out into space. Thanks, dad!{&1310}\par I turned back around like I meant to do just that. I dont't know what I meant to do. Why would dad bring me to the airlock?{&1310}\par I wasn't thinking straight. I mean, how could I be fucking thinking straight with everything going on! I forced myself to take a few breaths, though. I'm not sure if it helped, but it did get me to turn away from the dead, empty corridor behind. Then -- I got it.{&1310}\par Emergency suits.{&1310}\par It was so simple I could have slapped myself. So I did. I was so strung out my whole body was slightly shaking and I slapped myself across one side of my face to make it stop.{&1310}\par "Stop it! Fucking -- just stop it!"{&1310}\par It worked. A little.{&1310}\par I reached for the inner airlock door and pushed my face up against the port so I could see inside. There were gear lockers. If I twisted all the way to the right side of the hole, I could see them inside to the other side. Only one suit was missing and it didn't take me long to figure out where it had gone. There was another dead guy, face down on the floor with it pulled halfway on.{&1310}\par The outer airlock door was sealed shut still and that was all I cared about. I could stomach one more dead body to get out of here. So I punched the door release.{&1310}\par Yellow warning lights stabbed out in bolts along the bulkheads around me, and the door hissed in preparation for release. Those lights must have been on the main power circuit, though, because they flickered and died out real quick. Weird that they weren't just dead already, but that left me using the manual release to open the door the rest of the way. The whole while I kept looking back over my shoulder to the dark behind, except this time that flash of light had killed my darkvision and left spots floating in the black I couldn't trust to not be real. I ducked inside and didn't settle down until after I'd closed the door again and watched nothing move out there for a good minute through the porthole.{&1310}\par I probably should've been paying attention to what lay ahead, though. That dead guy on the floor. There was a subtle, almost imperceptible feeling of dread that I could feel somewhere in the back of my head. But it wasn't the biggest concern on my mind just then. I found one of the gear lockers with a suit in it, stripped down, suited up, and activated it. It was pretty much the same as the ones we used in training and I had plenty of practice getting yelled at to get changed over into those fast. Small favors.{&1310}\par With the hatch closed behind me I wasn't so worried about anything except getting the hell out of there -- crawling along the outside of the station in vacuum if need be. That creeping fear of being out in the black without any safety lines, instructors, or support was getting squashed by the much bigger fear of being left in this part of the station with those things. Those body-dicing, corpse-chewing, black-as-void ... \i things\i0 . I ... I didn't know what I was going to do when I got back to actual, living people again. I actually started to \i think\i0  about getting back to living people again. And that was the start.{&1310}\par So I didn't notice when that dead body on the floor first started to move.\cf2\f1 {&1310}\par }{&1310}

If I twisted all the way to the right side o\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 {&1310}f the hole, I could see them inside to the other side.

So I punched the door release.{&1310}\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Yellow warning lights stabbed out in bolts along the bulkheads around me, and the door hissed, getting ready to open.

That dead guy o\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 {&1310}n the floor. There was a subtle, almost imperceptible feeling of dread that I could feel somewhere in the back of my head. But it wasn't the biggest concern on my mind just then.
