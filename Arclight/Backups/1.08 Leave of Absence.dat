It still looked like it must have in the Imperial days hundreds of years ago when it was a waypoint for pretty much all of the Helium-3 mining in the system. You could see the old, abbreviated name emblazoned on the sides of the docking pylons: HE3T -- Helium-3 Transfer station. Heet. \i Heat\i0 . They'd kept that dumb pun but spaced the Empire when the Grand Admirals originally converted it into a command and supply port for the Dreggoran Navy. And that was way back after they'd just finished winning the first rare victories for independence against the old Empire.{&1310}\par They had liked to drone on and on about that kind of thing throughout training. Heritage. Tradition. I guess we were supposed to take some sort of pride in becoming something bigger than just ourselves. Too bad it had to make you feel so small and insignificant to do that. But I think that was part of the point.{&1310}\par We had our leave assignments. Cadets, recruits, and all the future of the Dreggoran Navy, swarmed into the old fighter bays of the \i Soyorov\i0  that now only trafficked in people and cargo, ready to fly out back home. People who'd barely seen each other in six months came flooding out of the woodwork, shouting and excited about how they had weathered the storm of training and were just about to be done and commissioned. There were casualties they didn't tell you about. There were people who got sent hom that they \i did \i0 tell you about. But that was over. Everyone left had made it, through. Now just two weeks of home was all that was left between them and the final run, and every last one of them was determined to make the best of it. It was like watching a bunch of kids who'd suddenly been told by the adults to just go run and play. This was their bachelor's party before getting married to the Grand Admirals for the rest of their adult lives. I guess I was the only one getting cold feet.{&1310}\par "Cadet Evelyn Weir. Report to Shuttle 9419B in Bay 23."{&1310}\par "I'm already here," I muttered under by breath as I stepped up to the big hangar doors leading into Bay 23. Not that grumbling back at an automated message made any difference. It triggered in my personal comm because I was a second or two behind schedule in that annoyingly placid, female voice. The original architects must have meant it to sound neutral and attractive for the Grand Admirals' approval, but I swear I could always hear that faint hint of sarcasm when she had anything to say to me in particular. Oh, it was there -- I don't care what anybody might say. Tess would've thought so too. And I also liked to imagine that she'd been ugly, unlike her voice. I was probably the only one.{&1310}\par "Cadet," the shuttle pilot acknowledged as soon as I appeared in the bay. "Solansky, is it?" He barely looked up from the holopad on his arm as I stepped up to the onramp. "Come on, come on -- I'd like to get the hell off this warhorse before she decides to finally fall apart."{&1310}\par "Uh, Weir ... actually."{&1310}\par "What's that, cadet?" He did look up at me now. He was only an ensign with a boot-cut crew cut, but I could tell he took himself pretty seriously. Why did they always do that? Would I have if I'd actually made it?{&1310}\par Maybe. Whatever. Didn't matter much now anyways.{&1310}\par "Cadet Weir, reporting as ordered, sir." I stiffened up and reported formally. Didn't mean I put any real heart in it, though. It was an empty gesture to steal away any ammunition a commissioned officer might use against me before I was gone again. I kind of already felt like I was, even if it wasn't physically. Yet.{&1310}\par "Weir, huh," he said, and swiped a finger across his manifest like crossing my name off a list. Then he jabbed a thumb over his shoulder. "Take a seat and get strapped in, cadet. Only got a few of you shipping out to Riftwatch, but it'll take a frigate to get you all that far. We've got forty-nine minutes to rendezvous outside the station."{&1310}\par I only sort of recognized the dozen or so other trainees I found already belted in to short-range G-seats line up in two parallel rows inside the shuttle's tiny holding bay. We'd shipped out at different times, even though all cadets had come together at Heat Station for induction. Other children of personnel from back on Riftwatch that I never really got to know too well since dad had kept most of my schooling private. Miller was here, and I found an empty seat next to him as much for it being the closest one as the quasi-familiarity we shared from both being in the same training program. I guess it made sense for us psychos to sit together. {&1310}\par "You ... excited to go back home?" he asked after trying a little wave with his hand. It didn't work out too well with those restrictions from the seat over his chest and shoulders, and he frowned at that. Or maybe it was the asanine question. You'd think it'd be easy to keep your head clear after all that training in discipline and decorum but it was surprisingly easy to forget how to do simple things once the instructors and officers were suddenly gone -- when there was no one yelling at you when you did it wrong. Or telling you how to \i not \i0 fuck it up the next time. Now we were just so quickly nothing but helpless kids again, with way too much military lifestyle information crammed into our heads for it to just be natural. It made us awkward, ungainly, and out of place.{&1310}\par "I don't know," I told him as I strapped in, really being honest. I wanted to say yes, and at the same time no. I didn't feel excited -- more unsettled than anything else. Like I'd been given a big fat boot in the ass and wasn't quite sure where I was supposed to land yet.  "I'm  ready to be out and away from here, though. Does that count?"{&1310}\par He laughed in an uncertain way. Like he hadn't expected to and that answer had caught him off guard. It probably had. I'd never really known him before we shipped out -- coming here for the same program as him was probably the only reason we ever would have met in the first place. Weird how we could live on the same station, never cross paths, and then only find out the other existed because of this stupid academy. But he seemed genuine enough, even if this was probably the first time I'd ever really had him talk to me, specifically. I'd always just kind of lumped him together with his rackmate, Hammar, whenever I thought anything about him in passing.{&1310}\par But there was something comforting in not being alone now that I was finally going back home.{&1310}\par {&1310}\par {&1310}\par {&1310}\par I fell asleep waiting for our shuttle to break free from the \i Soyorov\i0  so I didn't get to see it again from the outside in all its retired old glory like I had coming in half a year ago. A lifetime ago. I wondered if it would've still been so intimidating, but I didn't think so. I'd seen much more enlighteningly terrible things to be afraid of. There would be plenty more too -- for the cadets who came back.{&1310}\par The pilot roused each of us -- I wasn't the only one to pass out so easily when I finally stopped moving and had nothing to do but think and wait. Miller tried to give me another smile from one side as he went about unhooking himself from his seat. The half-awake-and-irritable-at-being-woken-up attempt I made back probably came off more like a grimance.{&1310}\par They'd extended a gangplank between the airlock in the back of the shuttle and the frigate -- the ship was nowhere near as big as the \i Soyorov \i0 and didn't have hangar bays for passenger shuttles like the carrier did. The pilot said it was supposed to ferry us back to Riftwatch. I saw it through the steelglass, hanging there in space like a finless fish with gunmounts on it. Looking back, Heat Station floated behind us. I hadn't even gotten to set foot inside this time. We were probably the only trainees that needed a gunboat to carry us back home.{&1310}\par They said things had gotten that bad, but it was hard to believe the system news reports with how regulated by the Grand Admirals they were. And it was easy to forget inside that isolated bubble formed around us by the academy and training.{&1310}\par The lieutenant commander in charge of the frigate welcomed us formally to the ship, the \i Noybaerleen\i0 , though I'd have hardly called it much of a welcome. He kind of just gave us a curt, perfunctory permission to embark as the senior officer on board, but you could tell he didn't like us -- didn't want us there, and probably thought this "babysitting" thing was a waste of his time. Maybe it was. Either way, he dismissed both us and the shuttle pilot as quickly as humanly possible to return to his bridge, or whatever he felt was more important just then. A junior grade lieutenant with a nervous twitch in her right eye showed us to the lower deck and then surprised us all by ordering us to toss our packs in storage and change into G-Suits.{&1310}\par "Why?" I demanded, even though I knew it wouldn't change anything now that someone had made up their mind. It meant we were going to be traveling fast -- maybe even for a good reason.{&1310}\par The officer -- Cizeki, her uniform said -- settled back into a composed rest stance, looking at me but addressing everyone when she explained. She didn't have to bother with a cadet like me, and could have even told me to shut up. {&1310}\par "Pirate activity has been high in the region," she told us, being generous. I probably should have been grateful, but I wasn't. All I could think about was getting inside that glass, nightmare-prone prison once more. "Skipper's ordered all crew to the tubes for the trip. And until we get to port -- that means all of you, too."{&1310}\par "Has there been another attack?" one of the other trainees -- probably a future groundpounder from the look of him -- asked, sounding excited. I'd set a bad precedent and now I wasn't the only one to speak up out of turn. Thankfully, the lieutenant seemed just a little bit patient with a bunch of kids barely out of training. In spite of that nervous tick, she regarded him cooly.{&1310}\par "Don't you watch the news, recruit? Sightings," she told him. "If you want to know more than that, you're going to have to get commissioned or speculate on your own time. Now, get a move on, people!"{&1310}\par They'd come prepared with extra suits for us cadets and recruits and the lot of us quickly stripped down to our skivvies to get changed. I took the one the lieutenant handed me and started pulling it on, the whole while feeling like I'd rather just shoot myself in the head and get it over with now. The headaches and nightmares from the last trip to the field had finally just subsided earlier this week. I wasn't ready for another round yet, I just \i wasn't\i0 . Not so soon.{&1310}\par But what was I supposed to do? I could feel angry, hysterical tears burning behind my eyes and it was a struggle to keep them under control. \i Fuuuck\i0 . What was I supposed to do?{&1310}\par The only thing I really could. Just ... get in like every other time.{&1310}\par \i God\i0  ... {&1310}\par Why couldn't we just go normal speeds? Fuck pirate sightings. \i Fuck \i0 the pirates.{&1310}\par My body kept moving on its own, getting me dressed up in the G-suit like a robot despite those angry thoughts threatening to bubble up into desperation inside my head. Thank god for training. When I was done, I lined up with the others in front of the tanks that were set aside for us. It was just Lieutenant Cizeki on chaperone duty here in the aft section, no on else from the crew. She stood there with her hands on her hips watching over us trainees getting ourselves in and strapped one by one. I waited for my turn as people checked each other off and then she did too, making sure they were all hooked up right. That unsettled feeling I'd had ever since leaving Commander Delacroix's office had turned me into a taut string ready to snap down here at the claustrophobic thought of getting back inside one of those horror shows. I waited, but I could feel the tension like I would suddenly just break down and lose it any second if I didn't keep pushing it back down. And I still had the self-awareness to realize just how much it would ruin me to burst into tears right there in front of everyone. The instructors had always played it down, but it got harder every time. No one else would understand if I was so close to breaking -- I'd just be a freakout.{&1310}\par The lieutenant rounded on me, catching me by surprise. It was my turn, and I ... had a surreal moment then, suddenly staring back at the tank meant for me. I looked at it, and couldn't help but feel like a hole in my world had suddenly opened up there where no one else could see it. I was suddenly so sure that if I got inside that tank I would just fall through the cracks of reality and cease to exist here altogether.{&1310}\par How could I tell her that? How could I make her \i believe\i0  ...?{&1310}\par I don't know, but I turned back to try. It didn't matter. The whole ship had gone quiet -- \i too\i0  quiet for a military ship in port getting under way. I thought it was just me. Then the overhead lights winked out.{&1310}\par Cold washed over me like ice water, prickling my skin. I froze in place. There should have been cries of surprise -- maybe even alarm -- the tanks hadn't all sealed yet, and Cizeki had been standing right behind me. But there was nothing. Just the sound of my breathing in the still air.{&1310}\par Panic.{&1310}\par A dozen thoughts raced through my head. Power failure. Sabotage. Terrorist attack on the station. The ship? I could almost imagine the sound of turbines winding down to rest or the dull thud of explosions through the bulkheads. And I could only imagine -- because there was nothing. I suddenly couldn't even sense any of those trainees who had still been waiting around me just a second ago and there was this terrified fear of absolutely everyone just being \i gone\i0 .{&1310}\par I reached a hand out, reflexively. The need to not be suddenly alone in the dark was overwhelming. Primordial. {&1310}\par Nothing. {&1310}\par My mind raced along, but my body was sluggish. I staggered a step back and my foot caught on something. And the fall down to the ground seemed to last a quiet eternity there in the dark.{&1310}\par The deck was sticky. It stuck to my hand and my back.{&1310}\par Emergency lighting abruptly flashed on in dull reds, failsafes kicking in. They painted the black the color of blood.{&1310}\par I wasn't stupid enough to cry out. Something told me on a level I couldn't even comprehend that it would be the worst thing I could do. I could just barely see in the weak, reddish deck lights, but seeing at all made me need to move again. That same sense told me not to -- to stay put and shut up. Why? I don't know. I scrambled up instead on stupid instinct and saw the thing that had tripped me. I squinted at it for a long time before it started to look human. Human, but like the upper half had just been ripped away ... leaving only a pair of legs from the waist down ending in booted feet. That was what had tripped me.{&1310}\par Severed feet.{&1310}\par I wiped a hand to my face and froze when I saw what looked like blood there. It was the light. I had to be. But it stuck between my fingers, running slowly and thickly as I watched.{&1310}\par And that was when I noticed I was surrounded by those vaguely human-looking bits and pieces. They were all around me. Everywhere. There must have been a dozen when you added them all up. More, maybe. All of them just ... torn apart.{&1310}\par Something moved. The blackness suddenly shifted, coming alive. It blotted out the emergency lights and I sucked in a startled breath, wide-eyed and terrified. It whipped back and forth like a snake while I watched, transfixed. I didn't move now, but it knew I was there. Because I had moved when I shouldn't have. It knew I was there because it launched itself right at my head.{&1310}\par I crashed back down into the deck full of sticky red blood as it smothered me. I opened my mouth to scream and it squirmed right down my throat.\cf2\f1 {&1310}\par }{&1310}

I suddenly couldn't even sense any of those trainees who had still been waiting around me just a second ago and there was this terrified fear of absolutely everyone just being \i gone\i0 .{&1310}\par I reached a hand out, reflexively. The need to not be suddenly alone in the dark was overwhelming. Primordial. {&1310}\par Nothing. {&1310}\par My mind raced along, but my body was sluggish. I staggered a step back and my foot caught on something. And the fall down to the ground seemed to last a quiet eternity there in the dark.{&1310}\par The deck was sticky. It stuck to my hand and my back.{&1310}\par Emergency lighting abruptly flashed on in dull reds, failsafes kicking in. They painted the black the color of blood.{&1310}\par I wasn't stupid enough to cry out. Something told me on a level I couldn't even comprehend that it would be the worst thing I could do. I could just barely see in the weak, reddish deck lights, but seeing at all made me need to move again. That same sense told me not to -- to stay put and shut up. Why? I don't know. I scrambled up instead on stupid instinct and saw the thing that had tripped me. I squinted at it for a long time before it started to look human. Human, but like the upper half had just been ripped away ... leaving only a pair of legs from the waist down ending in booted feet. That was what had tripped me.{&1310}\par Severed feet.{&1310}\par I wiped a hand to my face and froze when I saw what looked like blood there. It was the light. I had to be. But it stuck between my fingers, running slowly and thickly as I watched.{&1310}\par And that was when I noticed I was surrounded by those vaguely human-looking bits and pieces. They were all around me. Everywhere. There must have been a dozen when you added them all up. More, maybe. All of them just ... torn apart.{&1310}\par Something moved. The blackness suddenly shifted, coming alive. It blotted out the emergency lights and I sucked in a startled breath, wide-eyed and terrified. It whipped back and forth like a snake while I watched, transfixed. I didn't move now, but it knew I was there. Because I had moved when I shouldn't have. It knew I was there because it launched itself right at my head.{&1310}\par I crashed back down into the deck full of sticky red blood as it smothered me. I opened my mouth to scream and it squirmed right down my throat.\cf2\f1 {&1310}\par }{&1310}

You could see the old, abbreviated name emblazoned on the sides of the docking pylons: HE3T -- Helium-3 Transfer station. Heet. \i Heat\i0 . They'd kept that dumb pun but spaced the Empire when the Grand Admirals originally converted it into a command and supply port for the Dreggoran Navy. And that was way back after they'd just finished winning the first rare victories for independence against the old Empire.{&1310}\par They had liked to drone on and on about that kind of thing throughout training. Heritage. Tradition. I guess we were supposed to take some sort of pride in becoming something bigger than just ourselves. Too bad it had to make you feel so small and insignificant to do that. But I think that was part of the point.{&1310}\par We had our leave assignments. Cadets, recruits, and all the future of the Dreggoran Navy, swarmed into the old fighter bays of the \i Soyorov\i0  that now only trafficked in people and cargo, ready to fly out back home. People who'd barely seen each other in six months came flooding out of the woodwork, shouting and excited about how they had weathered the storm of training and were just about to be done and commissioned. There were casualties they didn't tell you about. There were people who got sent hom that they \i did \i0 tell you about. But that was over. Everyone left had made it, through. Now just two weeks of home was all that was left between them and the final run, and every last one of them was determined to make the best of it. It was like watching a bunch of kids who'd suddenly been told by the adults to just go run and play. This was their bachelor's party before getting married to the Grand Admirals for the rest of their adult lives. I guess I was the only one getting cold feet.{&1310}\par "Cadet Evelyn Weir. Report to Shuttle 9419B in Bay 23."{&1310}\par "I'm already here," I muttered under by breath as I stepped up to the big hangar doors leading into Bay 23. Not that grumbling back at an automated message made any difference. It triggered in my personal comm because I was a second or two behind schedule in that annoyingly placid, female voice. The original architects must have meant it to sound neutral and attractive for the Grand Admirals' approval, but I swear I could always hear that faint hint of sarcasm when she had anything to say to me in particular. Oh, it was there -- I don't care what anybody might say. Tess would've thought so too. And I also liked to imagine that she'd been ugly, unlike her voice. I was probably the only one.{&1310}\par "Cadet," the shuttle pilot acknowledged as soon as I appeared in the bay. "Solansky, is it?" He barely looked up from the holopad on his arm as I stepped up to the onramp. "Come on, come on -- I'd like to get the hell off this warhorse before she decides to finally fall apart."{&1310}\par "Uh, Weir ... actually."{&1310}\par "What's that, cadet?" He did look up at me now. He was only an ensign with a boot-cut crew cut, but I could tell he took himself pretty seriously. Why did they always do that? Would I have if I'd actually made it?{&1310}\par Maybe. Whatever. Didn't matter much now anyways.{&1310}\par "Cadet Weir, reporting as ordered, sir." I stiffened up and reported formally. Didn't mean I put any real heart in it, though. It was an empty gesture to steal away any ammunition a commissioned officer might use against me before I was gone again. I kind of already felt like I was, even if it wasn't physically. Yet.{&1310}\par "Weir, huh," he said, and swiped a finger across his manifest like crossing my name off a list. Then he jabbed a thumb over his shoulder. "Take a seat and get strapped in, cadet. Only got a few of you shipping out to Riftwatch, but it'll take a frigate to get you all that far. We've got forty-nine minutes to rendezvous outside the station."{&1310}\par I only sort of recognized the dozen or so other trainees I found already belted in to short-range G-seats line up in two parallel rows inside the shuttle's tiny holding bay. We'd shipped out at different times, even though all cadets had come together at Heat Station for induction. Other children of personnel from back on Riftwatch that I never really got to know too well since dad had kept most of my schooling private. Miller was here, and I found an empty seat next to him as much for it being the closest one as the quasi-familiarity we shared from both being in the same training program. I guess it made sense for us psychos to sit together. {&1310}\par "You ... excited to go back home?" he asked after trying a little wave with his hand. It didn't work out too well with those restrictions from the seat over his chest and shoulders, and he frowned at that. Or maybe it was the asanine question. You'd think it'd be easy to keep your head clear after all that training in discipline and decorum but it was surprisingly easy to forget how to do simple things once the instructors and officers were suddenly gone -- when there was no one yelling at you when you did it wrong. Or telling you how to \i not \i0 fuck it up the next time. Now we were just so quickly nothing but helpless kids again, with way too much military lifestyle information crammed into our heads for it to just be natural. It made us awkward, ungainly, and out of place.{&1310}\par "I don't know," I told him as I strapped in, really being honest. I wanted to say yes, and at the same time no. I didn't feel excited -- more unsettled than anything else. Like I'd been given a big fat boot in the ass and wasn't quite sure where I was supposed to land yet.  "I'm  ready to be out and away from here, though. Does that count?"{&1310}\par He laughed in an uncertain way. Like he hadn't expected to and that answer had caught him off guard. It probably had. I'd never really known him before we shipped out -- coming here for the same program as him was probably the only reason we ever would have met in the first place. Weird how we could live on the same station, never cross paths, and then only find out the other existed because of this stupid academy. But he seemed genuine enough, even if this was probably the first time I'd ever really had him talk to me, specifically. I'd always just kind of lumped him together with his rackmate, Hammar, whenever I thought anything about him in passing.{&1310}\par But there was something comforting in not being alone now that I was finally going back home.{&1310}\par {&1310}\par {&1310}\par {&1310}\par I fell asleep waiting for our shuttle to break free from the \i Soyorov\i0  so I didn't get to see it again from the outside in all its retired old glory like I had coming in half a year ago. A lifetime ago. I wondered if it would've still been so intimidating, but I didn't think so. I'd seen much more enlighteningly terrible things to be afraid of. There would be plenty more too -- for the cadets who came back.{&1310}\par The pilot roused each of us -- I wasn't the only one to pass out so easily when I finally stopped moving and had nothing to do but think and wait. Miller tried to give me another smile from one side as he went about unhooking himself from his seat. The half-awake-and-irritable-at-being-woken-up attempt I made back probably came off more like a grimance.{&1310}\par They'd extended a gangplank between the airlock in the back of the shuttle and the frigate -- the ship was nowhere near as big as the \i Soyorov \i0 and didn't have hangar bays for passenger shuttles like the carrier did. The pilot said it was supposed to ferry us back to Riftwatch. I saw it through the steelglass, hanging there in space like a finless fish with gunmounts on it. Looking back, Heat Station floated behind us. I hadn't even gotten to set foot inside this time. We were probably the only trainees that needed a gunboat to carry us back home.{&1310}\par They said things had gotten that bad, but it was hard to believe the system news reports with how regulated by the Grand Admirals they were. And it was easy to forget inside that isolated bubble formed around us by the academy and training.{&1310}\par The lieutenant commander in charge of the frigate welcomed us formally to the ship, the \i Noybaerleen\i0 , though I'd have hardly called it much of a welcome. He kind of just gave us a curt, perfunctory permission to embark as the senior officer on board, but you could tell he didn't like us -- didn't want us there, and probably thought this "babysitting" thing was a waste of his time. Maybe it was. Either way, he dismissed both us and the shuttle pilot as quickly as humanly possible to return to his bridge, or whatever he felt was more important just then. A junior grade lieutenant with a nervous twitch in her right eye showed us to the lower deck and then surprised us all by ordering us to toss our packs in storage and change into G-Suits.{&1310}\par "Why?" I demanded, even though I knew it wouldn't change anything now that someone had made up their mind. It meant we were going to be traveling fast -- maybe even for a good reason.{&1310}\par The officer -- Cizeki, her uniform said -- settled back into a composed rest stance, looking at me but addressing everyone when she explained. She didn't have to bother with a cadet like me, and could have even told me to shut up. {&1310}\par "Pirate activity has been high in the region," she told us, being generous. I probably should have been grateful, but I wasn't. All I could think about was getting inside that glass, nightmare-prone prison once more. "Skipper's ordered all crew to the tubes for the trip. And until we get to port -- that means all of you, too."{&1310}\par "Has there been another attack?" one of the other trainees -- probably a future groundpounder from the look of him -- asked, sounding excited. I'd set a bad precedent and now I wasn't the only one to speak up out of turn. Thankfully, the lieutenant seemed just a little bit patient with a bunch of kids barely out of training. In spite of that nervous tick, she regarded him cooly.{&1310}\par "Don't you watch the news, recruit? Sightings," she told him. "If you want to know more than that, you're going to have to get commissioned or speculate on your own time. Now, get a move on, people!"{&1310}\par They'd come prepared with extra suits for us cadets and recruits and the lot of us quickly stripped down to our skivvies to get changed. I took the one the lieutenant handed me and started pulling it on, the whole while feeling like I'd rather just shoot myself in the head and get it over with now. The headaches and nightmares from the last trip to the field had finally just subsided earlier this week. I wasn't ready for another round yet, I just \i wasn't\i0 . Not so soon.{&1310}\par But what was I supposed to do? I could feel angry, hysterical tears burning behind my eyes and it was a struggle to keep them under control. \i Fuuuck\i0 . What was I supposed to do?{&1310}\par The only thing I really could. Just ... get in like every other time.{&1310}\par \i God\i0  ... {&1310}\par Why couldn't we just go normal speeds? Fuck pirate sightings. \i Fuck \i0 the pirates.{&1310}\par My body kept moving on its own, getting me dressed up in the G-suit like a robot despite those angry thoughts threatening to bubble up into desperation inside my head. Thank god for training. When I was done, I lined up with the others in front of the tanks that were set aside for us. It was just Lieutenant Cizeki on chaperone duty here in the aft section, no on else from the crew. She stood there with her hands on her hips watching over us trainees getting ourselves in and strapped one by one. I waited for my turn as people checked each other off and then she did too, making sure they were all hooked up right. That unsettled feeling I'd had ever since leaving Commander Delacroix's office had turned me into a taut string ready to snap down here at the claustrophobic thought of getting back inside one of those horror shows. I waited, but I could feel the tension like I would suddenly just break down and lose it any second if I didn't keep pushing it back down. And I still had the self-awareness to realize just how much it would ruin me to burst into tears right there in front of everyone. The instructors had always played it down, but it got harder every time. No one else would understand if I was so close to breaking -- I'd just be a freakout.{&1310}\par The lieutenant rounded on me, catching me by surprise. It was my turn, and I ... had a surreal moment then, suddenly staring back at the tank meant for me. I looked at it, and couldn't help but feel like a hole in my world had suddenly opened up there where no one else could see it. I was suddenly so sure that if I got inside that tank I would just fall through the cracks of reality and cease to exist here altogether.{&1310}\par How could I tell her that? How could I make her \i believe\i0  ...?{&1310}\par I don't know, but I turned back to try. It didn't matter. The whole ship had gone quiet -- \i too\i0  quiet for a military ship in port getting under way. I thought it was just me. Then the overhead lights winked out.{&1310}\par Cold washed over me like ice water, prickling my skin. I froze in place. There should have been cries of surprise -- maybe even alarm -- the tanks hadn't all sealed yet, and Cizeki had been standing right behind me. But there was nothing. Just the sound of my breathing in the still air.{&1310}\par Panic.{&1310}\par A dozen thoughts raced through my head. Power failure. Sabotage. Terrorist attack on the station. The ship? I could almost imagine the sound of turbines winding down to rest or the dull thud of explosions through the bulkheads. And I could only imagine -- because there was nothing. I suddenly couldn't even sense any of those trainees who had still been waiting around me just a second ago and there was this terrified fear of absolutely everyone just being \i gone\i0 .{&1310}\par I reached a hand out, reflexively.

What was I supposed to do?{&1310}\par The only thing I really could. Just ... get in like every other time.{&1310}\par \i God\i0  ... {&1310}\par Why couldn't we just go normal speeds? Fuck pirate sightings. \i Fuck \i0 the pirates.{&1310}\par My body kept moving on its own, getting me dressed up in the G-suit like a robot despite those angry thoughts threatening to bubble up into desperation inside my head. Thank god for training. When I was done, I lined up with the others in front of the tanks that were set aside for us. It was just Lieutenant Cizeki on chaperone duty here in the aft section, no on else from the crew. She stood there with her hands on her hips watching over us trainees getting ourselves in and strapped one by one. I waited for my turn as people checked each other off and then she did too, making sure they were all hooked up right. That unsettled feeling I'd had ever since leaving Commander Delacroix's office had turned me into a taut string ready to snap down here at the claustrophobic thought of getting back inside one of those horror shows. I waited, but I could feel the tension like I would suddenly just break down and lose it any second if I didn't keep pushing it back down. And I still had the self-awareness to realize just how much it would ruin me to burst into tears right there in front of everyone. The instructors had always played it down, but it got harder every time. No one else would understand if I was so close to breaking -- I'd just be a freakout.{&1310}\par The lieutenant rounded on me, catching me by surprise. It was my turn, and I ... had a surreal moment then, suddenly staring back at the tank meant for me. I looked at it, and couldn't help but feel like a hole in my world had suddenly opened up there where no one else could see it. I was suddenly so sure that if I got inside that tank I would just fall through the cracks of reality and cease to exist here altogether.{&1310}\par How could I tell her that? How could I make her \i believe\i0  ...?{&1310}\par I don't know, but I turned back to try. It didn't matter. The whole ship had gone quiet -- \i too\i0  quiet for a military ship in port getting under way. I thought it was just me. Then the overhead lights winked out.{&1310}\par Cold washed over me like ice water, prickling my skin. I froze in place. There should have been cries of surprise -- maybe even alarm -- the tanks hadn't all sealed yet, and Cizeki had been standing right behind me. But there was nothing. Just the sound of my breathing in the still air.{&1310}\par Panic.{&1310}\par A dozen thoughts raced through my head. Power failure. Sabotage. Terrorist attack on the station. The ship? I could almost imagine the sound of turbines winding down to rest or the dull thud of explosions through the bulkheads. And I could only imagine -- because there was nothing. I suddenly couldn't even sense any of those trainees who had still been waiting around me just a second ago and there was this terrified fear of absolutely everyone just being \i gone\i0 .{&1310}\par I reached a hand out, reflexively. The need to not be suddenly alone in the dark was overwhelming. Primordial. {&1310}\par Nothing. {&1310}\par My mind raced along, but my body was sluggish. I staggered a step back and my foot caught on something. And the fall down to the ground seemed to last a quiet eternity there in the dark.{&1310}\par The deck was sticky. It stuck to my hand and my back.{&1310}\par Emergency lighting abruptly flashed on in dull reds, failsafes kicking in. They painted the black the color of blood.{&1310}\par I wasn't stupid enough to cry out. Something told me on a level I couldn't even comprehend that it would be the worst thing I could do. I could just barely see in the weak, reddish deck lights, but seeing at all made me need to move again. That same sense told me not to -- to stay put and shut up. Why? I don't know. I scrambled up instead on stupid instinct and saw the thing that had tripped me. I squinted at it for a long time before it started to look human. Human, but like the upper half had just been ripped away ... leaving only a pair of legs from the waist down ending in booted feet. That was what had tripped me.{&1310}\par Severed feet.{&1310}\par I wiped a hand to my face and froze when I saw what looked like blood there. It was the light. I had to be. But it stuck between my fingers, running slowly and thickly as I watched.{&1310}\par And that was when I noticed I was surrounded by those vaguely human-looking bits and pieces. They were all around me. Everywhere. There must have been a dozen when you added them all up. More, maybe. All of them just ... torn apart.{&1310}\par Something moved. The blackness suddenly shifted, coming alive. It blotted out the emergency lights and I sucked in a startled breath, wide-eyed and terrified. It whipped back and forth like a snake while I watched, transfixed. I didn't move now, but it knew I was there. Because I had moved when I shouldn't have. It knew I was there because it launched itself right at my head.{&1310}\par I crashed back down into the deck full of sticky red blood as it smothered me. I opened my mouth to scream and it squirmed right down my throat.\cf2\f1 {&1310}\par }{&1310}

It still looked like it must have in the Imperial days hundreds of years ago when it was a waypoint for pretty much all of the Helium-3 mining in the system. You could see the old, abbreviated name emblazoned on the sides of the docking pylons: HE3T -- Helium-3 Transfer station. Heet. \i Heat\i0 . They'd kept that dumb pun but spaced the Empire when the Grand Admirals originally converted it into a command and supply port for the Dreggoran Navy. And that was way back after they'd just finished winning the first rare victories for independence against the old Empire.{&1310}\par They had liked to drone on and on about that kind of thing throughout training. Heritage. Tradition. I guess we were supposed to take some sort of pride in becoming something bigger than just ourselves. Too bad it had to make you feel so small and insignificant to do that. But I think that was part of the point.{&1310}\par We had our leave assignments. Cadets, recruits, and all the future of the Dreggoran Navy, swarmed into the old fighter bays of the \i Soyorov\i0  that now only trafficked in people and cargo, ready to fly out back home. People who'd barely seen each other in six months came flooding out of the woodwork, shouting and excited about how they had weathered the storm of training and were just about to be done and commissioned. There were casualties they didn't tell you about. There were people who got sent hom that they \i did \i0 tell you about. But that was over. Everyone left had made it, through. Now just two weeks of home was all that was left between them and the final run, and every last one of them was determined to make the best of it. It was like watching a bunch of kids who'd suddenly been told by the adults to just go run and play. This was their bachelor's party before getting married to the Grand Admirals for the rest of their adult lives. I guess I was the only one getting cold feet.{&1310}\par "Cadet Evelyn Weir. Report to Shuttle 9419B in Bay 23."{&1310}\par "I'm already here," I muttered under by breath as I stepped up to the big hangar doors leading into Bay 23. Not that grumbling back at an automated message made any difference. It triggered in my personal comm because I was a second or two behind schedule in that annoyingly placid, female voice. The original architects must have meant it to sound neutral and attractive for the Grand Admirals' approval, but I swear I could always hear that faint hint of sarcasm when she had anything to say to me in particular. Oh, it was there -- I don't care what anybody might say. Tess would've thought so too. And I also liked to imagine that she'd been ugly, unlike her voice. I was probably the only one.{&1310}\par "Cadet," the shuttle pilot acknowledged as soon as I appeared in the bay. "Solansky, is it?" He barely looked up from the holopad on his arm as I stepped up to the onramp. "Come on, come on -- I'd like to get the hell off this warhorse before she decides to finally fall apart."{&1310}\par "Uh, Weir ... actually."{&1310}\par "What's that, cadet?" He did look up at me now. He was only an ensign with a boot-cut crew cut, but I could tell he took himself pretty seriously. Why did they always do that? Would I have if I'd actually made it?{&1310}\par Maybe. Whatever. Didn't matter much now anyways.{&1310}\par "Cadet Weir, reporting as ordered, sir." I stiffened up and reported formally. Didn't mean I put any real heart in it, though. It was an empty gesture to steal away any ammunition a commissioned officer might use against me before I was gone again. I kind of already felt like I was, even if it wasn't physically. Yet.{&1310}\par "Weir, huh," he said, and swiped a finger across his manifest like crossing my name off a list. Then he jabbed a thumb over his shoulder. "Take a seat and get strapped in, cadet. Only got a few of you shipping out to Riftwatch, but it'll take a frigate to get you all that far. We've got forty-nine minutes to rendezvous outside the station."{&1310}\par I only sort of recognized the dozen or so other trainees I found already belted in to short-range G-seats line up in two parallel rows inside the shuttle's tiny holding bay. We'd shipped out at different times, even though all cadets had come together at Heat Station for induction. Other children of personnel from back on Riftwatch that I never really got to know too well since dad had kept most of my schooling private. Miller was here, and I found an empty seat next to him as much for it being the closest one as the quasi-familiarity we shared from both being in the same training program. I guess it made sense for us psychos to sit together. {&1310}\par "You ... excited to go back home?" he asked after trying a little wave with his hand. It didn't work out too well with those restrictions from the seat over his chest and shoulders, and he frowned at that. Or maybe it was the asanine question. You'd think it'd be easy to keep your head clear after all that training in discipline and decorum but it was surprisingly easy to forget how to do simple things once the instructors and officers were suddenly gone -- when there was no one yelling at you when you did it wrong. Or telling you how to \i not \i0 fuck it up the next time. Now we were just so quickly nothing but helpless kids again, with way too much military lifestyle information crammed into our heads for it to just be natural. It made us awkward, ungainly, and out of place.{&1310}\par "I don't know," I told him as I strapped in, really being honest. I wanted to say yes, and at the same time no. I didn't feel excited -- more unsettled than anything else. Like I'd been given a big fat boot in the ass and wasn't quite sure where I was supposed to land yet.  "I'm  ready to be out and away from here, though. Does that count?"{&1310}\par He laughed in an uncertain way. Like he hadn't expected to and that answer had caught him off guard. It probably had. I'd never really known him before we shipped out -- coming here for the same program as him was probably the only reason we ever would have met in the first place. Weird how we could live on the same station, never cross paths, and then only find out the other existed because of this stupid academy. But he seemed genuine enough, even if this was probably the first time I'd ever really had him talk to me, specifically. I'd always just kind of lumped him together with his rackmate, Hammar, whenever I thought anything about him in passing.{&1310}\par But there was something comforting in not being alone now that I was finally going back home.{&1310}\par {&1310}\par {&1310}\par {&1310}\par I fell asleep waiting for our shuttle to break free from the \i Soyorov\i0  so I didn't get to see it again from the outside in all its retired old glory like I had coming in half a year ago. A lifetime ago. I wondered if it would've still been so intimidating, but I didn't think so. I'd seen much more enlighteningly terrible things to be afraid of. There would be plenty more too -- for the cadets who came back.{&1310}\par The pilot roused each of us -- I wasn't the only one to pass out so easily when I finally stopped moving and had nothing to do but think and wait. Miller tried to give me another smile from one side as he went about unhooking himself from his seat. The half-awake-and-irritable-at-being-woken-up attempt I made back probably came off more like a grimance.{&1310}\par They'd extended a gangplank between the airlock in the back of the shuttle and the frigate -- the ship was nowhere near as big as the \i Soyorov \i0 and didn't have hangar bays for passenger shuttles like the carrier did. The pilot said it was supposed to ferry us back to Riftwatch. I saw it through the steelglass, hanging there in space like a finless fish with gunmounts on it. Looking back, Heat Station floated behind us. I hadn't even gotten to set foot inside this time. We were probably the only trainees that needed a gunboat to carry us back home.{&1310}\par They said things had gotten that bad, but it was hard to believe the system news reports with how regulated by the Grand Admirals they were. And it was easy to forget inside that isolated bubble formed around us by the academy and training.{&1310}\par The lieutenant commander in charge of the frigate welcomed us formally to the ship, the \i Noybaerleen\i0 , though I'd have hardly called it much of a welcome. He kind of just gave us a curt, perfunctory permission to embark as the senior officer on board, but you could tell he didn't like us -- didn't want us there, and probably thought this "babysitting" thing was a waste of his time. Maybe it was. Either way, he dismissed both us and the shuttle pilot as quickly as humanly possible to return to his bridge, or whatever he felt was more important just then. A junior grade lieutenant with a nervous twitch in her right eye showed us to the lower deck and then surprised us all by ordering us to toss our packs in storage and change into G-Suits.{&1310}\par "Why?" I demanded, even though I knew it wouldn't change anything now that someone had made up their mind. It meant we were going to be traveling fast -- maybe even for a good reason.{&1310}\par The officer -- Cizeki, her uniform said -- settled back into a composed rest stance, looking at me but addressing everyone when she explained. She didn't have to bother with a cadet like me, and could have even told me to shut up. {&1310}\par "Pirate activity has been high in the region," she told us, being generous. I probably should have been grateful, but I wasn't. All I could think about was getting inside that glass, nightmare-prone prison once more. "Skipper's ordered all crew to the tubes for the trip. And until we get to port -- that means all of you, too."{&1310}\par "Has there been another attack?" one of the other trainees -- probably a future groundpounder from the look of him -- asked, sounding excited. I'd set a bad precedent and now I wasn't the only one to speak up out of turn. Thankfully, the lieutenant seemed just a little bit patient with a bunch of kids barely out of training. In spite of that nervous tick, she regarded him cooly.{&1310}\par "Don't you watch the news, recruit? Sightings," she told him. "If you want to know more than that, you're going to have to get commissioned or speculate on your own time. Now, get a move on, people!"{&1310}\par They'd come prepared with extra suits for us cadets and recruits and the lot of us quickly stripped down to our skivvies to get changed. I took the one the lieutenant handed me and started pulling it on, the whole while feeling like I'd rather just shoot myself in the head and get it over with now. The headaches and nightmares from the last trip to the field had finally just subsided earlier this week. I wasn't ready for another round yet, I just \i wasn't\i0 . Not so soon.{&1310}\par But what was I supposed to do? I could feel angry, hysterical tears burning behind my eyes and it was a struggle to keep them under control. \i Fuuuck\i0 . What was I supposed to do?{&1310}\par The only thing I really could. Just ... get in like every other time.{&1310}\par \i God\i0  ... {&1310}\par Why couldn't we just go normal speeds? Fuck pirate sightings. \i Fuck \i0 the pirates.{&1310}\par My body kept moving on its own, getting me dressed up in the G-suit like a robot despite those angry thoughts threatening to bubble up into desperation inside my head.

And it was easy to forget inside that isolated bubble formed around us by the academy and training.{&1310}\par The lieutenant commander in charge of the frigate welcomed us formally to the ship, the \i Noybaerleen\i0 , though I'd have hardly called it much of a welcome. He kind of just gave us a curt, perfunctory permission to embark as the senior officer on board, but you could tell he didn't like us -- didn't want us there, and probably thought this "babysitting" thing was a waste of his time. Maybe it was. Either way, he dismissed both us and the shuttle pilot as quickly as humanly possible to return to his bridge, or whatever he felt was more important just then. A junior grade lieutenant with a nervous twitch in her right eye showed us to the lower deck and then surprised us all by ordering us to toss our packs in storage and change into G-Suits.{&1310}\par "Why?" I demanded, even though I knew it wouldn't change anything now that someone had made up their mind. It meant we were going to be traveling fast -- maybe even for a good reason.{&1310}\par The officer -- Cizeki, her uniform said -- settled back into a composed rest stance, looking at me but addressing everyone when she explained. She didn't have to bother with a cadet like me, and could have even told me to shut up. {&1310}\par "Pirate activity has been high in the region," she told us, being generous. I probably should have been grateful, but I wasn't. All I could think about was getting inside that glass, nightmare-prone prison once more. "Skipper's ordered all crew to the tubes for the trip. And until we get to port -- that means all of you, too."{&1310}\par "Has there been another attack?" one of the other trainees -- probably a future groundpounder from the look of him -- asked, sounding excited. I'd set a bad precedent and now I wasn't the only one to speak up out of turn. Thankfully, the lieutenant seemed just a little bit patient with a bunch of kids barely out of training. In spite of that nervous tick, she regarded him cooly.{&1310}\par "Don't you watch the news, recruit? Sightings," she told him. "If you want to know more than that, you're going to have to get commissioned or speculate on your own time. Now, get a move on, people!"{&1310}\par They'd come prepared with extra suits for us cadets and recruits and the lot of us quickly stripped down to our skivvies to get changed. I took the one the lieutenant handed me and started pulling it on, the whole while feeling like I'd rather just shoot myself in the head and get it over with now. The headaches and nightmares from the last trip to the field had finally just subsided earlier this week. I wasn't ready for another round yet, I just \i wasn't\i0 . Not so soon.{&1310}\par But what was I supposed to do? I could feel angry, hysterical tears burning behind my eyes and it was a struggle to keep them under control. \i Fuuuck\i0 . What was I supposed to do?{&1310}\par The only thing I really could. Just ... get in like every other time.{&1310}\par \i God\i0  ... {&1310}\par Why couldn't we just go normal speeds? Fuck pirate sightings. \i Fuck \i0 the pirates.{&1310}\par My body kept moving on its own, getting me dressed up in the G-suit like a robot despite those angry thoughts threatening to bubble up into desperation inside my head. Thank god for training. When I was done, I lined up with the others in front of the tanks that were set aside for us. It was just Lieutenant Cizeki on chaperone duty here in the aft section, no on else from the crew. She stood there with her hands on her hips watching over us trainees getting ourselves in and strapped one by one. I waited for my turn as people checked each other off and then she did too, making sure they were all hooked up right. That unsettled feeling I'd had ever since leaving Commander Delacroix's office had turned me into a taut string ready to snap down here at the claustrophobic thought of getting back inside one of those horror shows. I waited, but I could feel the tension like I would suddenly just break down and lose it any second if I didn't keep pushing it back down. And I still had the self-awareness to realize just how much it would ruin me to burst into tears right there in front of everyone. The instructors had always played it down, but it got harder every time. No one else would understand if I was so close to breaking -- I'd just be a freakout.{&1310}\par The lieutenant rounded on me, catching me by surprise. It was my turn, and I ... had a surreal moment then, suddenly staring back at the tank meant for me. I looked at it, and couldn't help but feel like a hole in my world had suddenly opened up there where no one else could see it. I was suddenly so sure that if I got inside that tank I would just fall through the cracks of reality and cease to exist here altogether.{&1310}\par How could I tell her that? How could I make her \i believe\i0  ...?{&1310}\par I don't know, but I turned back to try. It didn't matter. The whole ship had gone quiet -- \i too\i0  quiet for a military ship in port getting under way. I thought it was just me. Then the overhead lights winked out.{&1310}\par Cold washed over me like ice water, prickling my skin. I froze in place. There should have been cries of surprise -- maybe even alarm -- the tanks hadn't all sealed yet, and Cizeki had been standing right behind me. But there was nothing. Just the sound of my breathing in the still air.{&1310}\par Panic.{&1310}\par A dozen thoughts raced through my head. Power failure. Sabotage. Terrorist attack on the station. The ship? I could almost imagine the sound of turbines winding down to rest or the dull thud of explosions through the bulkheads. And I could only imagine -- because there was nothing. I suddenly couldn't even sense any of those trainees who had still been waiting around me just a second ago and there was this terrified fear of absolutely everyone just being \i gone\i0 .{&1310}\par I reached a hand out, reflexively. The need to not be suddenly alone in the dark was overwhelming. Primordial. {&1310}\par Nothing. {&1310}\par My mind raced along, but my body was sluggish. I staggered a step back and my foot caught on something. And the fall down to the ground seemed to last a quiet eternity there in the dark.{&1310}\par The deck was sticky. It stuck to my hand and my back.{&1310}\par Emergency lighting abruptly flashed on in dull reds, failsafes kicking in. They painted the black the color of blood.{&1310}\par I wasn't stupid enough to cry out. Something told me on a level I couldn't even comprehend that it would be the worst thing I could do. I could just barely see in the weak, reddish deck lights, but seeing at all made me need to move again. That same sense told me not to -- to stay put and shut up. Why? I don't know. I scrambled up instead on stupid instinct and saw the thing that had tripped me. I squinted at it for a long time before it started to look human. Human, but like the upper half had just been ripped away ... leaving only a pair of legs from the waist down ending in booted feet. That was what had tripped me.{&1310}\par Severed feet.{&1310}\par I wiped a hand to my face and froze when I saw what looked like blood there. It was the light. I had to be. But it stuck between my fingers, running slowly and thickly as I watched.{&1310}\par And that was when I noticed I was surrounded by those vaguely human-looking bits and pieces. They were all around me. Everywhere. There must have been a dozen when you added them all up. More, maybe. All of them just ... torn apart.{&1310}\par Something moved. The blackness suddenly shifted, coming alive. It blotted out the emergency lights and I sucked in a startled breath, wide-eyed and terrified. It whipped back and forth like a snake while I watched, transfixed. I didn't move now, but it knew I was there. Because I had moved when I shouldn't have. It knew I was there because it launched itself right at my head.{&1310}\par I crashed back down into the deck full of sticky red blood as it smothered me. I opened my mouth to scream and it squirmed right down my throat.\cf2\f1 {&1310}\par }{&1310}

You could see the old, abbreviated name emblazoned on the sides of the docking pylons: HE3T -- Helium-3 Transfer station. Heet. \i Heat\i0 . They'd kept that dumb pun but spaced the Empire when the Grand Admirals originally converted it into a command and supply port for the Dreggoran Navy. And that was way back after they'd just finished winning the first rare victories for independence against the old Empire.{&1310}\par They had liked to drone on and on about that kind of thing throughout training. Heritage. Tradition. I guess we were supposed to take some sort of pride in becoming something bigger than just ourselves. Too bad it had to make you feel so small and insignificant to do that. But I think that was part of the point.{&1310}\par We had our leave assignments. Cadets, recruits, and all the future of the Dreggoran Navy, swarmed into the old fighter bays of the \i Soyorov\i0  that now only trafficked in people and cargo, ready to fly out back home. People who'd barely seen each other in six months came flooding out of the woodwork, shouting and excited about how they had weathered the storm of training and were just about to be done and commissioned. There were casualties they didn't tell you about. There were people who got sent hom that they \i did \i0 tell you about. But that was over. Everyone left had made it, through. Now just two weeks of home was all that was left between them and the final run, and every last one of them was determined to make the best of it. It was like watching a bunch of kids who'd suddenly been told by the adults to just go run and play. This was their bachelor's party before getting married to the Grand Admirals for the rest of their adult lives. I guess I was the only one getting cold feet.{&1310}\par "Cadet Evelyn Weir. Report to Shuttle 9419B in Bay 23."{&1310}\par "I'm already here," I muttered under by breath as I stepped up to the big hangar doors leading into Bay 23. Not that grumbling back at an automated message made any difference. It triggered in my personal comm because I was a second or two behind schedule in that annoyingly placid, female voice. The original architects must have meant it to sound neutral and attractive for the Grand Admirals' approval, but I swear I could always hear that faint hint of sarcasm when she had anything to say to me in particular. Oh, it was there -- I don't care what anybody might say. Tess would've thought so too. And I also liked to imagine that she'd been ugly, unlike her voice. I was probably the only one.{&1310}\par "Cadet," the shuttle pilot acknowledged as soon as I appeared in the bay. "Solansky, is it?" He barely looked up from the holopad on his arm as I stepped up to the onramp. "Come on, come on -- I'd like to get the hell off this warhorse before she decides to finally fall apart."{&1310}\par "Uh, Weir ... actually."{&1310}\par "What's that, cadet?" He did look up at me now. He was only an ensign with a boot-cut crew cut, but I could tell he took himself pretty seriously. Why did they always do that? Would I have if I'd actually made it?{&1310}\par Maybe. Whatever. Didn't matter much now anyways.{&1310}\par "Cadet Weir, reporting as ordered, sir." I stiffened up and reported formally. Didn't mean I put any real heart in it, though. It was an empty gesture to steal away any ammunition a commissioned officer might use against me before I was gone again. I kind of already felt like I was, even if it wasn't physically. Yet.{&1310}\par "Weir, huh," he said, and swiped a finger across his manifest like crossing my name off a list. Then he jabbed a thumb over his shoulder. "Take a seat and get strapped in, cadet. Only got a few of you shipping out to Riftwatch, but it'll take a frigate to get you all that far. We've got forty-nine minutes to rendezvous outside the station."{&1310}\par I only sort of recognized the dozen or so other trainees I found already belted in to short-range G-seats line up in two parallel rows inside the shuttle's tiny holding bay. We'd shipped out at different times, even though all cadets had come together at Heat Station for induction. Other children of personnel from back on Riftwatch that I never really got to know too well since dad had kept most of my schooling private. Miller was here, and I found an empty seat next to him as much for it being the closest one as the quasi-familiarity we shared from both being in the same training program. I guess it made sense for us psychos to sit together. {&1310}\par "You ... excited to go back home?" he asked after trying a little wave with his hand. It didn't work out too well with those restrictions from the seat over his chest and shoulders, and he frowned at that. Or maybe it was the asanine question. You'd think it'd be easy to keep your head clear after all that training in discipline and decorum but it was surprisingly easy to forget how to do simple things once the instructors and officers were suddenly gone -- when there was no one yelling at you when you did it wrong. Or telling you how to \i not \i0 fuck it up the next time. Now we were just so quickly nothing but helpless kids again, with way too much military lifestyle information crammed into our heads for it to just be natural. It made us awkward, ungainly, and out of place.{&1310}\par "I don't know," I told him as I strapped in, really being honest. I wanted to say yes, and at the same time no. I didn't feel excited -- more unsettled than anything else. Like I'd been given a big fat boot in the ass and wasn't quite sure where I was supposed to land yet.  "I'm  ready to be out and away from here, though. Does that count?"{&1310}\par He laughed in an uncertain way. Like he hadn't expected to and that answer had caught him off guard. It probably had. I'd never really known him before we shipped out -- coming here for the same program as him was probably the only reason we ever would have met in the first place. Weird how we could live on the same station, never cross paths, and then only find out the other existed because of this stupid academy. But he seemed genuine enough, even if this was probably the first time I'd ever really had him talk to me, specifically. I'd always just kind of lumped him together with his rackmate, Hammar, whenever I thought anything about him in passing.{&1310}\par But there was something comforting in not being alone now that I was finally going back home.{&1310}\par {&1310}\par {&1310}\par {&1310}\par I fell asleep waiting for our shuttle to break free from the \i Soyorov\i0  so I didn't get to see it again from the outside in all its retired old glory like I had coming in half a year ago. A lifetime ago. I wondered if it would've still been so intimidating, but I didn't think so. I'd seen much more enlighteningly terrible things to be afraid of. There would be plenty more too -- for the cadets who came back.{&1310}\par The pilot roused each of us -- I wasn't the only one to pass out so easily when I finally stopped moving and had nothing to do but think and wait. Miller tried to give me another smile from one side as he went about unhooking himself from his seat. The half-awake-and-irritable-at-being-woken-up attempt I made back probably came off more like a grimance.{&1310}\par They'd extended a gangplank between the airlock in the back of the shuttle and the frigate -- the ship was nowhere near as big as the \i Soyorov \i0 and didn't have hangar bays for passenger shuttles like the carrier did. The pilot said it was supposed to ferry us back to Riftwatch. I saw it through the steelglass, hanging there in space like a finless fish with gunmounts on it. Looking back, Heat Station floated behind us. I hadn't even gotten to set foot inside this time. We were probably the only trainees that needed a gunboat to carry us back home.{&1310}\par They said things had gotten that bad, but it was hard to believe the system news reports with how regulated by the Grand Admirals they were. And it was easy to forget inside that isolated bubble formed around us by the academy and training.{&1310}\par The lieutenant commander in charge of the frigate welcomed us formally to the ship, the \i Noybaerleen\i0 , though I'd have hardly called it much of a welcome. He kind of just gave us a curt, perfunctory permission to embark as the senior officer on board, but you could tell he didn't like us -- didn't want us there, and probably thought this "babysitting" thing was a waste of his time. Maybe it was. Either way, he dismissed both us and the shuttle pilot as quickly as humanly possible to return to his bridge, or whatever he felt was more important just then. A junior grade lieutenant with a nervous twitch in her right eye showed us to the lower deck and then surprised us all by ordering us to toss our packs in storage and change into G-Suits.{&1310}\par "Why?" I demanded, even though I knew it wouldn't change anything now that someone had made up their mind. It meant we were going to be traveling fast -- maybe even for a good reason.{&1310}\par The officer -- Cizeki, her uniform said -- settled back into a composed rest stance, looking at me but addressing everyone when she explained. She didn't have to bother with a cadet like me, and could have even told me to shut up. {&1310}\par "Pirate activity has been high in the region," she told us, being generous.

And until we get to port -- that means all of you, too."{&1310}\par "Has there been another attack?" one of the other trainees -- probably a future groundpounder from the look of him -- asked, sounding excited.

It made us awkward, ungainly, and out of place.{&1310}\par "I don't know," I told him as I strapped in, really being honest. I wanted to say yes, and at the same time no. I didn't feel excited -- more unsettled than anything else. Like I'd been given a big fat boot in the ass and wasn't quite sure where I was supposed to land yet.  "I'm ready to be out and away from here, though. Does that count?"{&1310}\par He laughed in an uncertain way. Like he hadn't expected to and that answer had caught him off guard. It probably had. I'd never really known him before we shipped out -- coming here for the same program as him was probably the only reason we ever would have met in the first place. Weird how we could live on the same station, never cross paths, and then only find out the other existed because of this stupid academy. But he seemed genuine enough, even if this was probably the first time I'd ever really had him talk to me, specifically. I'd always just kind of lumped him together with his rackmate, Hammar, whenever I thought anything about him in passing.{&1310}\par But there was something comforting in not being alone now that I was finally going back home.{&1310}\par {&1310}\par \pard\sl480\slmult1\qc *\tab *\tab *{&1310}\par \pard\fi720\sl480\slmult1 {&1310}\par I fell asleep waiting for our shuttle to break free from the \i Soyorov\i0  so I didn't get to see it again from the outside in all its retired old glory like I had coming in half a year ago. A lifetime ago. I wondered if it would've still been so intimidating, but I didn't think so. I'd seen much more enlighteningly terrible things to be afraid of. There would be plenty more too -- for the cadets who came back.{&1310}\par The pilot roused each of us -- I wasn't the only one to pass out so easily when I finally stopped moving and had nothing to do but think and wait. Miller tried to give me another smile from one side as he went about unhooking himself from his seat. The half-awake-and-irritable-at-being-woken-up attempt I made back probably came off more like a grimance.{&1310}\par They'd extended a gangplank between the airlock in the back of the shuttle and the frigate -- the ship was nowhere near as big as the \i Soyorov \i0 and didn't have hangar bays for passenger shuttles like the carrier did. The pilot said it was supposed to ferry us back to Riftwatch. I saw it through the steelglass, hanging there in space like a finless fish with gunmounts on it. Looking back, Heat Station floated behind us. I hadn't even gotten to set foot inside this time. We were probably the only trainees that needed a gunboat to carry us back home.{&1310}\par They said things had gotten that bad, but it was hard to believe the system news reports with how regulated by the Grand Admirals they were. And it was easy to forget inside that isolated bubble formed around us by the academy and training.{&1310}\par The lieutenant commander in charge of the frigate welcomed us formally to the ship, the \i Noybaerleen\i0 , though I'd have hardly called it much of a welcome. He kind of just gave us a curt, perfunctory permission to embark as the senior officer on board, but you could tell he didn't like us -- didn't want us there, and probably thought this "babysitting" thing was a waste of his time. Maybe it was. Either way, he dismissed both us and the shuttle pilot as quickly as humanly possible to return to his bridge, or whatever he felt was more important just then. A junior grade lieutenant with a nervous twitch in her right eye showed us to the lower deck and then surprised us all by ordering us to toss our packs in storage and change into G-Suits.{&1310}\par "Why?" I demanded, even though I knew it wouldn't change anything now that someone had made up their mind. It meant we were going to be traveling fast -- maybe even for a good reason.{&1310}\par The officer -- Cizeki, her uniform said -- settled back into a composed rest stance, looking at me but addressing everyone when she explained. She didn't have to bother with a cadet like me, and could have even told me to shut up. {&1310}\par "Pirate activity has been high in the region," she told us, being generous. I probably should have been grateful, but I wasn't. All I could think about was getting inside that glass, nightmare-prone prison once more. "Skipper's ordered all crew to the tubes for the trip. And until we get to port -- that means all of you, too."{&1310}\par "Has there been another attack?" one of the other trainees -- probably a future groundpounder from the look of him -- asked, sounding excited. I'd set a bad precedent and now I wasn't the only one to speak up out of turn. Thankfully, the lieutenant seemed just a little bit patient with a bunch of kids barely out of training. In spite of that nervous tick, she regarded him cooly.{&1310}\par "Don't you watch the news, recruit? Sightings," she told him. "If you want to know more than that, you're going to have to get commissioned or speculate on your own time. Now, get a move on, people!"{&1310}\par They'd come prepared with extra suits for us cadets and recruits and the lot of us quickly stripped down to our skivvies to get changed. I took the one the lieutenant handed me and started pulling it on, the whole while feeling like I'd rather just shoot myself in the head and get it over with now. The headaches and nightmares from the last trip to the field had finally just subsided earlier this week. I wasn't ready for another round yet, I just \i wasn't\i0 . Not so soon.{&1310}\par But what was I supposed to do? I could feel angry, hysterical tears burning behind my eyes and it was a struggle to keep them under control. \i Fuuuck\i0 . What was I supposed to do?{&1310}\par The only thing I really could. Just ... get in like every other time.{&1310}\par \i God\i0  ... {&1310}\par Why couldn't we just go normal speeds? Fuck pirate sightings. \i Fuck \i0 the pirates.{&1310}\par My body kept moving on its own, getting me dressed up in the G-suit like a robot despite those angry thoughts threatening to bubble up into desperation inside my head. Thank god for training. When I was done, I lined up with the others in front of the tanks that were set aside for us. It was just Lieutenant Cizeki on chaperone duty here in the aft section, no on else from the crew. She stood there with her hands on her hips watching over us trainees getting ourselves in and strapped one by one. I waited for my turn as people checked each other off and then she did too, making sure they were all hooked up right. That unsettled feeling I'd had ever since leaving Commander Delacroix's office had turned me into a taut string ready to snap down here at the claustrophobic thought of getting back inside one of those horror shows. I waited, but I could feel the tension like I would suddenly just break down and lose it any second if I didn't keep pushing it back down. And I still had the self-awareness to realize just how much it would ruin me to burst into tears right there in front of everyone. The instructors had always played it down, but it got harder every time. No one else would understand if I was so close to breaking -- I'd just be a freakout.{&1310}\par The lieutenant rounded on me, catching me by surprise. It was my turn, and I ... had a surreal moment then, suddenly staring back at the tank meant for me. I looked at it, and couldn't help but feel like a hole in my world had suddenly opened up there where no one else could see it. I was suddenly so sure that if I got inside that tank I would just fall through the cracks of reality and cease to exist here altogether.{&1310}\par How could I tell her that? How could I make her \i believe\i0  ...?{&1310}\par I don't know, but I turned back to try. It didn't matter. The whole ship had gone quiet -- \i too\i0  quiet for a military ship in port getting under way. I thought it was just me. Then the overhead lights winked out.{&1310}\par Cold washed over me like ice water, prickling my skin. I froze in place. There should have been cries of surprise -- maybe even alarm -- the tanks hadn't all sealed yet, and Cizeki had been standing right behind me. But there was nothing. Just the sound of my breathing in the still air.{&1310}\par Panic.{&1310}\par A dozen thoughts raced through my head. Power failure. Sabotage. Terrorist attack on the station. The ship? I could almost imagine the sound of turbines winding down to rest or the dull thud of explosions through the bulkheads. And I could only imagine -- because there was nothing. I suddenly couldn't even sense any of those trainees who had still been waiting around me just a second ago and there was this terrified fear of absolutely everyone just being \i gone\i0 .{&1310}\par I reached a hand out, reflexively. The need to not be suddenly alone in the dark was overwhelming. Primordial. {&1310}\par Nothing. {&1310}\par My mind raced along, but my body was sluggish. I staggered a step back and my foot caught on something. And the fall down to the ground seemed to last a quiet eternity there in the dark.{&1310}\par The deck was sticky. It stuck to my hand and my back.{&1310}\par Emergency lighting abruptly flashed on in dull reds, failsafes kicking in. They painted the black the color of blood.{&1310}\par I wasn't stupid enough to cry out. Something told me on a level I couldn't even comprehend that it would be the worst thing I could do. I could just barely see in the weak, reddish deck lights, but seeing at all made me need to move again. That same sense told me not to -- to stay put and shut up. Why? I don't know. I scrambled up instead on stupid instinct and saw the thing that had tripped me. I squinted at it for a long time before it started to look human. Human, but like the upper half had just been ripped away ... leaving only a pair of legs from the waist down ending in booted feet. That was what had tripped me.{&1310}\par Severed feet.{&1310}\par I wiped a hand to my face and froze when I saw what looked like blood there. It was the light. I had to be. But it stuck between my fingers, running slowly and thickly as I watched.{&1310}\par And that was when I noticed I was surrounded by those vaguely human-looking bits and pieces. They were all around me. Everywhere. There must have been a dozen when you added them all up. More, maybe. All of them just ... torn apart.{&1310}\par Something moved. The blackness suddenly shifted, coming alive. It blotted out the emergency lights and I sucked in a startled breath, wide-eyed and terrified. It whipped back and forth like a snake while I watched, transfixed. I didn't move now, but it knew I was there. Because I had moved when I shouldn't have. It knew I was there because it launched itself right at my head.{&1310}\par I crashed back down into the deck full of sticky red blood as it smothered me. I opened my mouth to scream and it squirmed right down my throat.\cf2\f1 {&1310}\par }{&1310}

Cadets, recruits, and all the future of the Dreggoran Navy, swarmed into the old fighter bays of the \i Soyorov\i0  that now only trafficked in people and cargo, ready to fly out back home. People who'd barely seen each other in six months came flooding out of the woodwork, shouting and excited about how they had weathered the storm of training and were just about to be done and commissioned. There were casualties they didn't tell you about. There were people who got sent hom that they \i did \i0 tell you about. But that was over. Everyone left had made it, through. Now just two weeks of home was all that was left between them and the final run, and every last one of them was determined to make the best of it. It was like watching a bunch of kids who'd suddenly been told by the adults to just go run and play. This was their bachelor's party before getting married to the Grand Admirals for the rest of their adult lives. I guess I was the only one getting cold feet.{&1310}\par "Cadet Evelyn Weir. Report to Shuttle 9419B in Bay 23."{&1310}\par "I'm already here," I muttered under by breath as I stepped up to the big hangar doors leading into Bay 23. Not that grumbling back at an automated message made any difference. It triggered in my personal comm because I was a second or two behind schedule in that annoyingly placid, female voice. The original architects must have meant it to sound neutral and attractive for the Grand Admirals' approval, but I swear I could always hear that faint hint of sarcasm when she had anything to say to me in particular. Oh, it was there -- I don't care what anybody might say. Tess would've thought so too. And I also liked to imagine that she'd been ugly, unlike her voice. I was probably the only one.{&1310}\par "Cadet," the shuttle pilot acknowledged as soon as I appeared in the bay. "Solansky, is it?" He barely looked up from the holopad on his arm as I stepped up to the onramp. "Come on, come on -- I'd like to get the hell off this warhorse before she decides to finally fall apart."{&1310}\par "Uh, Weir ... actually."{&1310}\par "What's that, cadet?" He did look up at me now. He was only an ensign with a boot-cut crew cut, but I could tell he took himself pretty seriously. Why did they always do that? Would I have if I'd actually made it?{&1310}\par Maybe. Whatever. Didn't matter much now anyways.{&1310}\par "Cadet Weir, reporting as ordered, sir." I stiffened up and reported formally. Didn't mean I put any real heart in it, though. It was an empty gesture to steal away any ammunition a commissioned officer might use against me before I was gone again. I kind of already felt like I was, even if it wasn't physically. Yet.{&1310}\par "Weir, huh," he said, and swiped a finger across his manifest like crossing my name off a list. Then he jabbed a thumb over his shoulder. "Take a seat and get strapped in, cadet. Only got a few of you shipping out to Riftwatch, but it'll take a frigate to get you all that far. We've got forty-nine minutes to rendezvous outside the station."{&1310}\par I only sort of recognized the dozen or so other trainees I found already belted in to short-range G-seats line up in two parallel rows inside the shuttle's tiny holding bay. We'd shipped out at different times, even though all cadets had come together at Heat Station for induction. Other children of personnel from back on Riftwatch that I never really got to know too well since dad had kept most of my schooling private. Miller was here, and I found an empty seat next to him as much for it being the closest one as the quasi-familiarity we shared from both being in the same training program. I guess it made sense for us psychos to sit together. {&1310}\par "You ... excited to go back home?" he asked after trying a little wave with his hand. It didn't work out too well with those restrictions from the seat over his chest and shoulders, and he frowned at that. Or maybe it was the asanine question. You'd think it'd be easy to keep your head clear after all that training in discipline and decorum but it was surprisingly easy to forget how to do simple things once the instructors and officers were suddenly gone -- when there was no one yelling at you when you did it wrong. Or telling you how to \i not \i0 fuck it up the next time. Now we were just so quickly nothing but helpless kids again, with way too much military lifestyle information crammed into our heads for it to just be natural.

Oh, it was there -- I don't care what anybody might say. Tess would've thought so too. And I also liked to imagine that she'd been ugly, unlike her voice. I was probably the only one.{&1310}\par "Cadet," the shuttle pilot acknowledged as soon as I appeared in the bay. "Solansky, is it?" He barely looked up from the holopad on his arm as I stepped up to the onramp. "Come on, come on -- I'd like to get the hell off this warhorse before she decides to finally fall apart."{&1310}\par "Uh, Weir ... actually."{&1310}\par "What's that, cadet?" He did look up at me now. He was only an ensign with a boot-cut crew cut, but I could tell he took himself pretty seriously. Why did they always do that? Would I have if I'd actually made it?{&1310}\par Maybe. Whatever. Didn't matter much now anyways.{&1310}\par "Cadet Weir, reporting as ordered, sir." I stiffened up and reported formally. Didn't mean I put any real heart in it, though. It was an empty gesture to steal away any ammunition a commissioned officer might use against me before I was gone again. I kind of already felt like I was, even if it wasn't physically. Yet.{&1310}\par "Weir, huh," he said, and swiped a finger across his manifest like crossing my name off a list. Then he jabbed a thumb over his shoulder. "Take a seat and get strapped in, cadet. Only got a few of you shipping out to Riftwatch, but it'll take a frigate to get you all that far. We've got forty-nine minutes to rendezvous outside the station."{&1310}\par I only sort of recognized the dozen or so other trainees I found already belted in to short-range G-seats line up in two parallel rows inside the shuttle's tiny holding bay. We'd shipped out at different times, even though all cadets had come together at Heat Station for induction. Other children of personnel from back on Riftwatch that I never really got to know too well since dad had kept most of my schooling private. Miller was here, and I found an empty seat next to him as much for it being the closest one as the quasi-familiarity we shared from both being in the same training program. I guess it made sense for us psychos to sit together. {&1310}\par "You ... excited to go back home?" he asked after trying a little wave with his hand. It didn't work out too well with those restrictions from the seat over his chest and shoulders, and he frowned at that. Or maybe it was the asanine question. You'd think it'd be easy to keep your head clear after all that training in discipline and decorum but it was surprisingly easy to forget how to do simple things once the instructors and officers were suddenly gone -- when there was no one yelling at you when you did it wrong. Or telling you how to \i not \i0 fuck it up the next time. Now we were just so quickly nothing but helpless kids again, with way too much military lifestyle information crammed into our heads for it to just be natural. It made us awkward, ungainly, and out of place.{&1310}\par "I don't know," I told him as I strapped in, really being honest. I wanted to say yes, and at the same time no. I didn't feel excited -- more unsettled than anything else. Like I'd been given a big fat boot in the ass and wasn't quite sure where I was supposed to land yet.  "I'm ready to be out and away from here, though. Does that count?"{&1310}\par He laughed in an uncertain way. Like he hadn't expected to and that answer had caught him off guard. It probably had. I'd never really known him before we shipped out -- coming here for the same program as him was probably the only reason we ever would have met in the first place. Weird how we could live on the same station, never cross paths, and then only find out the other existed because of this stupid academy. But he seemed genuine enough, even if this was probably the first time I'd ever really had him talk to me, specifically. I'd always just kind of lumped him together with his rackmate, Hammar, whenever I thought anything about him in passing.{&1310}\par But there was something comforting in not being alone now that I was finally going back home.{&1310}\par {&1310}\par \pard\sl480\slmult1\qc *\tab *\tab *{&1310}\par \pard\fi720\sl480\slmult1 {&1310}\par I fell asleep waiting for our shuttle to break free from the \i Soyorov\i0  so I didn't get to see it again from the outside in all its retired old glory like I had coming in half a year ago. A lifetime ago. I wondered if it would've still been so intimidating, but I didn't think so. I'd seen much more enlighteningly terrible things to be afraid of. There would be plenty more too -- for the cadets who came back.{&1310}\par The pilot roused each of us -- I wasn't the only one to pass out so easily when I finally stopped moving and had nothing to do but think and wait. Miller tried to give me another smile from one side as he went about unhooking himself from his seat. The half-awake-and-irritable-at-being-woken-up attempt I made back probably came off more like a grimance.{&1310}\par They'd extended a gangplank between the airlock in the back of the shuttle and the frigate -- the ship was nowhere near as big as the \i Soyorov \i0 and didn't have hangar bays for passenger shuttles like the carrier did. The pilot said it was supposed to ferry us back to Riftwatch. I saw it through the steelglass, hanging there in space like a finless fish with gunmounts on it. Looking back, Heat Station floated behind us. I hadn't even gotten to set foot inside this time. We were probably the only trainees that needed a gunboat to carry us back home.{&1310}\par They said things had gotten that bad, but it was hard to believe the system news reports with how regulated by the Grand Admirals they were. And it was easy to forget inside that isolated bubble formed around us by the academy and training.{&1310}\par The lieutenant commander in charge of the frigate welcomed us formally to the ship, the \i Noybaerleen\i0 , though I'd have hardly called it much of a welcome. He kind of just gave us a curt, perfunctory permission to embark as the senior officer on board, but you could tell he didn't like us -- didn't want us there, and probably thought this "babysitting" thing was a waste of his time. Maybe it was. Either way, he dismissed both us and the shuttle pilot as quickly as humanly possible to return to his bridge, or whatever he felt was more important just then. A junior grade lieutenant with a nervous twitch in her right eye showed us to the lower deck and then surprised us all by ordering us to toss our packs in storage and change into G-Suits.{&1310}\par "Why?" I demanded, even though I knew it wouldn't change anything now that someone had made up their mind. It meant we were going to be traveling fast -- maybe even for a good reason.{&1310}\par The officer -- Cizeki, her uniform said -- settled back into a composed rest stance, looking at me but addressing everyone when she explained. She didn't have to bother with a cadet like me, and could have even told me to shut up. {&1310}\par "Pirate activity has been high in the region," she told us, being generous. I probably should have been grateful, but I wasn't. All I could think about was getting inside that glass, nightmare-prone prison once more. "Skipper's ordered all crew to the tubes for the trip. And until we get to port -- that means all of you, too."{&1310}\par "Has there been another attack?" one of the other trainees -- probably a future groundpounder from the look of him -- asked, sounding excited. I'd set a bad precedent and now I wasn't the only one to speak up out of turn. Thankfully, the lieutenant seemed just a little bit patient with a bunch of kids barely out of training. In spite of that nervous tick, she regarded him cooly.{&1310}\par "Don't you watch the news, recruit? Sightings," she told him. "If you want to know more than that, you're going to have to get commissioned or speculate on your own time. Now, get a move on, people!"{&1310}\par They'd come prepared with extra suits for us cadets and recruits and the lot of us quickly stripped down to our skivvies to get changed. I took the one the lieutenant handed me and started pulling it on, the whole while feeling like I'd rather just shoot myself in the head and get it over with now. The headaches and nightmares from the last trip to the field had finally just subsided earlier this week. I wasn't ready for another round yet, I just \i wasn't\i0 . Not so soon.{&1310}\par But what was I supposed to do? I could feel angry, hysterical tears burning behind my eyes and it was a struggle to keep them under control. \i Fuuuck\i0 . What was I supposed to do?{&1310}\par The only thing I really could. Just ... get in like every other time.{&1310}\par \i God\i0  ... {&1310}\par Why couldn't we just go normal speeds? Fuck pirate sightings. \i Fuck \i0 the pirates.{&1310}\par My body kept moving on its own, getting me dressed up in the G-suit like a robot despite those angry thoughts threatening to bubble up into desperation inside my head. Thank god for training. When I was done, I lined up with the others in front of the tanks that were set aside for us. It was just Lieutenant Cizeki on chaperone duty here in the aft section, no on else from the crew. She stood there with her hands on her hips watching over us trainees getting ourselves in and strapped one by one. I waited for my turn as people checked each other off and then she did too, making sure they were all hooked up right. That unsettled feeling I'd had ever since leaving Commander Delacroix's office had turned me into a taut string ready to snap down here at the claustrophobic thought of getting back inside one of those horror shows. I waited, but I could feel the tension like I would suddenly just break down and lose it any second if I didn't keep pushing it back down. And I still had the self-awareness to realize just how much it would ruin me to burst into tears right there in front of everyone. The instructors had always played it down, but it got harder every time. No one else would understand if I was so close to breaking -- I'd just be a freakout.{&1310}\par The lieutenant rounded on me, catching me by surprise. It was my turn, and I ... had a surreal moment then, suddenly staring back at the tank meant for me. I looked at it, and couldn't help but feel like a hole in my world had suddenly opened up there where no one else could see it. I was suddenly so sure that if I got inside that tank I would just fall through the cracks of reality and cease to exist here altogether.{&1310}\par How could I tell her that? How could I make her \i believe\i0  ...?{&1310}\par I don't know, but I turned back to try. It didn't matter. The whole ship had gone quiet -- \i too\i0  quiet for a military ship in port getting under way. I thought it was just me. Then the overhead lights winked out.{&1310}\par Cold washed over me like ice water, prickling my skin. I froze in place. There should have been cries of surprise -- maybe even alarm -- the tanks hadn't all sealed yet, and Cizeki had been standing right behind me. But there was nothing. Just the sound of my breathing in the still air.{&1310}\par Panic.{&1310}\par A dozen thoughts raced through my head. Power failure. Sabotage. Terrorist attack on the station. The ship? I could almost imagine the sound of turbines winding down to rest or the dull thud of explosions through the bulkheads. And I could only imagine -- because there was nothing. I suddenly couldn't even sense any of those trainees who had still been waiting around me just a second ago and there was this terrified fear of absolutely everyone just being \i gone\i0 .{&1310}\par I reached a hand out, reflexively. The need to not be suddenly alone in the dark was overwhelming. Primordial. {&1310}\par Nothing. {&1310}\par My mind raced along, but my body was sluggish. I staggered a step back and my foot caught on something. And the fall down to the ground seemed to last a quiet eternity there in the dark.{&1310}\par The deck was sticky. It stuck to my hand and my back.{&1310}\par Emergency lighting abruptly flashed on in dull reds, failsafes kicking in. They painted the black the color of blood.{&1310}\par I wasn't stupid enough to cry out. Something told me on a level I couldn't even comprehend that it would be the worst thing I could do. I could just barely see in the weak, reddish deck lights, but seeing at all made me need to move again. That same sense told me not to -- to stay put and shut up. Why? I don't know. I scrambled up instead on stupid instinct and saw the thing that had tripped me. I squinted at it for a long time before it started to look human. Human, but like the upper half had just been ripped away ... leaving only a pair of legs from the waist down ending in booted feet. That was what had tripped me.{&1310}\par Severed feet.{&1310}\par I wiped a hand to my face and froze when I saw what looked like blood there. It was the light. I had to be. But it stuck between my fingers, running slowly and thickly as I watched.{&1310}\par And that was when I noticed I was surrounded by those vaguely human-looking bits and pieces. They were all around me. Everywhere. There must have been a dozen when you added them all up. More, maybe. All of them just ... torn apart.{&1310}\par Something moved. The blackness suddenly shifted, coming alive. It blotted out the emergency lights and I sucked in a startled breath, wide-eyed and terrified. It whipped back and forth like a snake while I watched, transfixed. I didn't move now, but it knew I was there. Because I had moved when I shouldn't have. It knew I was there because it launched itself right at my head.{&1310}\par I crashed back down into the deck full of sticky red blood as it smothered me. I opened my mouth to scream and it squirmed right down my throat.\cf2\f1 {&1310}\par }{&1310}
