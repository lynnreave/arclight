It took me a minute to realize it was that broken sculpture.{&1310}\par "My little brother made this," was all he said, looking at the pieces gathered tenatively in his hands. There wasn't any anger in his voice. It actually sounded kind of detached. He looked at me, and those crystal-blue eyes were actually sad. Then they abruptly lit up a bit.{&1310}\par "You're, ah - looking better today," he told me then.{&1310}\par "Is that it?" Tess abruptly butted in from behind, pointing at what the man had carried in under one arm.{&1310}\par "Oh. Yes." He glanced down at the bundle before holding it up for us. "They're the latest from Dreggoran, and quite popular right now."{&1310}\par "Ugh."{&1310}\par Tess made a sound in her throat as her face twisted. She unfolded the coat she'd snatched from him, looking less than happy about wearing it. It certainly didn't compare to the clothes she usually liked to throw on.{&1310}\par Richter handed me the other one and I unfolded it to see what Tess didn't like. It was long, tight-fighting, and fairly starched compared to what were used to back home. The neck was high, and it was a stark, conservative black. Plain and utilitarian, but still a little elegant with those fine scrolls on the hem you almost didn't notice. It was subtle. Not really Tess' style at all.{&1310}\par I hadn't paid much attention to Dreggoran fashion in the vids, but it seemed to fit, and most of the people I'd seen around there so far wore something similar at least. I supposed wearing those things would make us a bit less noticeable anyways. {&1310}\par "Hey, Ev ... look."{&1310}\par I glanced over at Tess having slipped into her Dreggoran coat. Or I guess that wasn't quite right. She'd done it up so tight it looked more like someone had \i stuffed \i0 her into it.{&1310}\par "Tax evasion is treason!" she stood stock still with a too-somber, too-earnest look on her spaced-out face. "All men twenty years or older must register with the DFB for mandatory enlistment!"{&1310}\par I laughed, and I couldn't help it. The image struck me so hard that I nearly doubled over, the sound bursting out of my mouth before I could catch it. Richter's face flushed bright red beneath his flaxen hair as I saw him get truly angry for the first time since I'd met him. I tried to cover my mouth to hide since I don't think he liked her impression of those government-sponsored messages they flashed around here.{&1310}\par "Sectarians!" he snapped, looking awkward even doing that like he suddenly had all that anger and wasn't sure just what to even do with it. His lip quivered as he ranted. "It might all be a big fucking joke to you, but you won't be laughing when the day comes the Grand Admirals decide to throw your part of the sector to the void."{&1310}\par He glared at us both, flushed and angry. Our laughter died down into ragged, punctuated peals. I look at Tess.{&1310}\par "What did he call us?"{&1310}\par She shrugged.{&1310}\par "I couldn't hear him over this collar!" {&1310}\par She pretened to gasp, pulling at the thing tight on her neck with her fingers. I lost it again.{&1310}\par Richter eventually had enough and stormed off to the side of the room that served as both the kitchen and dining room. Tess and I kept laughing for a bit at his expense while he downed some of that non-alcoholic tonic he seemed to love so much, looking embarassed and put off. For a few minutes, I forgot everything else that had happened, and it was just like being back home. For a few minutes.{&1310}\par Then there was a banging at the door, and everyone froze.{&1310}\par For a moment - nothing. Just me and Tess and that blonde-haired man staring with wide, surprised eyes at each other around Richter's apartment. Then:{&1310}\par "Hallo! Officer Herman Richter?"{&1310}\par The voice was brusque and soulless through the metal-paneled door. We all looked at it, and that was about it for a minute. No one had ever come to the door before. For a minute, I kind of just thought I'd imagined it.{&1310}\par "Hey!" the man on the other side shouted and pounded insistently again. "Internal Investigations Division, yeah? Open the door, please!"{&1310}\par Richter swung past us before I could blink. He looked around, hesitating, like he would figure something out from that unkempt, tiny room. Then he abruptly swept a hand back through his short hair to set it out of place before tossing the last of his tonic in his face and smearing it to a sheen. He gave us an ashen look as he walked the rest of the short way to the door, hacking into his sleeve.{&1310}\par "Yeah?" He coughed, then looked up. "Who's calling, please?"{&1310}\par Some muffled talking on the other side. There was more than one out there.{&1310}\par "Officer Richter? IID," the voice said. "Could you let us in please?"{&1310}\par "Yeah."{&1310}\par He threw a desperate hand our way, and me and Tess jumped at the bathroom door like he'd shot a gun at us. We ducked inside without making too much noise. Richter winced as Tess nearly tripped over me doing it, though. I finally got behind the door while Tess slipped into the shower stall. And I peeked out into the main room.{&1310}\par Richter kept up that fake-sick act as he punched a command into the door and opened it. I waited for whoever it was to push their way aside, but Richter just spoke to them while nodding his head weakly and coughing every so often. It was too quiet to hear, and my I got paranoid waiting. No one had come around looking for him since we'd gotten there, and I had flashes in my head of what that really meant. Internal Investigations? I could guess ...{&1310}\par My pistol was with my coat on the floor. I saw it, and felt ice pour down my back. But they were too far away to grab now.{&1310}\par I looked back at the shower stall where Tess was crouched down and peering out of the dark. She mouthed something at me, but I just shook my head without understanding.{&1310}\par How could I be so \i stupid\i0  ...?{&1310}\par When I came back around, someone else was standing in the room.{&1310}\par Richter had a coughing fit. Angry, and nerve-wracking so that he collapsed into the wall beside the man. It bought me a second or two to duck all the way out of sight while that other man took a step back, giving Richter a scornful look.{&1310}\par "Are you quite alright, Officer?" a second man demanded, stepping into the apartment. That one focused on Richter while the other was looking around. "We've had some concerns with certain discrepancies on your latest shift reports with the DMTC."{&1310}\par They both wore the same black, high-necked outfit. There was protective fiberweave built into the synthetic. I wasn't sure what that was all about. Not even the Watchmen back home needed to wear that much protection.{&1310}\par Richter just nodded, recovering himself somewhat. "I've been indisposed for some days now," he managed.{&1310}\par I could just barely keep an eye out into the room past the edge of the sliding bathroom door, but it was enough to see the first man pouring over the few belongings on the floor and scattered about. My jacket was one of them. And so were those two coats.{&1310}\par "You live alone here, Officer Richter?" he asked, glancing back. "No one else resides with you?"{&1310}\par Richter quickly shook his head, but I could tell the man already knew the answer as soon as he asked. They actually were a little like the Watchmen back home, I thought. So they probably wouldn't have come unless they already knew everything they needed to about him.{&1310}\par There was color rising in Richter's cheeks to wash away the fake-sick palor he'd been working on now.{&1310}\par "Not a - girlfriend, perhaps?" the one man was holding up my jacket. I didn't like the dead look in his eyes as he did it. It was worse than the ones I used to get back home.{&1310}\par But then the other one noticed the blood. {&1310}\par \pard\sl0\slmult1\cf2\highlight0\f1 {&1310}\par }{&1310}

Not really Tess' style at all.{&1310}\par I hadn't paid much attention to Dreggoran fashion in the vids, but it seemed to fit, and most of the people I'd seen around there so far wore something similar at least. I supposed wearing those things would make us a bit less noticeable anyways. {&1310}\par "Hey, Ev ... look."{&1310}\par I glanced over at Tess having slipped into her Dreggoran coat. Or I guess that wasn't quite right. She'd done it up so tight it looked more like someone had \i stuffed \i0 her into it.{&1310}\par "Tax evasion is treason!" she stood stock still with a too-somber, too-earnest look on her spaced-out face. "All men twenty years or older must register with the DFB for mandatory enlistment!"{&1310}\par I laughed, and I couldn't help it. The image struck me so hard that I nearly doubled over, the sound bursting out of my mouth before I could catch it. Richter's face flushed bright red beneath his flaxen hair as I saw him get truly angry for the first time since I'd met him. I tried to cover my mouth to hide since I don't think he liked her impression of those government-sponsored messages they flashed around here.{&1310}\par "Sectarians!" he snapped, looking awkward even doing that like he suddenly had all that anger and wasn't sure just what to even do with it. His lip quivered as he ranted. "It might all be a big fucking joke to you, but you won't be laughing when the day comes the Grand Admirals decide to throw your part of the sector to the void."{&1310}\par He glared at us both, flushed and angry. Our laughter died down into ragged, punctuated peals. I look at Tess.{&1310}\par "What did he call us?"{&1310}\par She shrugged.{&1310}\par "I couldn't hear him over this collar!" {&1310}\par She pretened to gasp, pulling at the thing tight on her neck with her fingers. I lost it again.{&1310}\par Richter eventually had enough and stormed off to the side of the room that served as both the kitchen and dining room. Tess and I kept laughing for a bit at his expense while he downed some of that non-alcoholic tonic he seemed to love so much, looking embarassed and put off. For a few minutes, I forgot everything else that had happened, and it was just like being back home. For a few minutes.{&1310}\par Then there was a banging at the door, and everyone froze.{&1310}\par For a moment - nothing. Just me and Tess and that blonde-haired man staring with wide, surprised eyes at each other around Richter's apartment. Then:{&1310}\par "Hallo! Officer Herman Richter?"{&1310}\par The voice was brusque and soulless through the metal-paneled door. We all looked at it, and that was about it for a minute. No one had ever come to the door before. For a minute, I kind of just thought I'd imagined it.{&1310}\par "Hey!" the man on the other side shouted and pounded insistently again. "Internal Investigations Division, yeah? Open the door, please!"{&1310}\par Richter swung past us before I could blink. He looked around, hesitating, like he would figure something out from that unkempt, tiny room. Then he abruptly swept a hand back through his short hair to set it out of place before tossing the last of his tonic in his face and smearing it to a sheen. He gave us an ashen look as he walked the rest of the short way to the door, hacking into his sleeve.{&1310}\par "Yeah?" He coughed, then looked up. "Who's calling, please?"{&1310}\par Some muffled talking on the other side. There was more than one out there.{&1310}\par "Officer Richter? IID," the voice said. "Could you let us in please?"{&1310}\par "Yeah."{&1310}\par He threw a desperate hand our way, and me and Tess jumped at the bathroom door like he'd shot a gun at us. We ducked inside without making too much noise. Richter winced as Tess nearly tripped over me doing it, though. I finally got behind the door while Tess slipped into the shower stall. And I peeked out into the main room.{&1310}\par Richter kept up that fake-sick act as he punched a command into the door and opened it. I waited for whoever it was to push their way aside, but Richter just spoke to them while nodding his head weakly and coughing every so often. It was too quiet to hear, and my I got paranoid waiting. No one had come around looking for him since we'd gotten there, and I had flashes in my head of what that really meant. Internal Investigations? I could guess ...{&1310}\par My pistol was with my coat on the floor. I saw it, and felt ice pour down my back. But they were too far away to grab now.{&1310}\par I looked back at the shower stall where Tess was crouched down and peering out of the dark. She mouthed something at me, but I just shook my head without understanding.{&1310}\par How could I be so \i stupid\i0  ...?{&1310}\par When I came back around, someone else was standing in the room.{&1310}\par Richter had a coughing fit. Angry, and nerve-wracking so that he collapsed into the wall beside the man. It bought me a second or two to duck all the way out of sight while that other man took a step back, giving Richter a scornful look.{&1310}\par "Are you quite alright, Officer?" a second man demanded, stepping into the apartment. That one focused on Richter while the other was looking around. "We've had some concerns with certain discrepancies on your latest shift reports with the DMTC."{&1310}\par They both wore the same black, high-necked outfit. There was protective fiberweave built into the synthetic. I wasn't sure what that was all about. Not even the Watchmen back home needed to wear that much protection.{&1310}\par Richter just nodded, recovering himself somewhat. "I've been indisposed for some days now," he managed.{&1310}\par I could just barely keep an eye out into the room past the edge of the sliding bathroom door, but it was enough to see the first man pouring over the few belongings on the floor and scattered about. My jacket was one of them. And so were those two coats.{&1310}\par "You live alone here, Officer Richter?" he asked, glancing back. "No one else resides with you?"{&1310}\par Richter quickly shook his head, but I could tell the man already knew the answer as soon as he asked. They actually were a little like the Watchmen back home, I thought. So they probably wouldn't have come unless they already knew everything they needed to about him.{&1310}\par There was color rising in Richter's cheeks to wash away the fake-sick palor he'd been working on now.{&1310}\par "Not a - girlfriend, perhaps?" the one man was holding up my jacket. I didn't like the dead look in his eyes as he did it. It was worse than the ones I used to get back home.{&1310}\par But then the other one noticed the blood. {&1310}\par \pard\sl0\slmult1\cf2\highlight0\f1 {&1310}\par }{&1310}
