The real thing was a little more unsettling than she would have thought. Dark things always came out in the dark - go figure. At least in anything scary she had ever watched or read. And all of those things popped back into her head while she watched the sun go down over the distant horizon. She started to get a little paranoid, she had to admit.{&1310}\par Bringing Evelyn inside the shuttle seemed like a good idea when she started to think about it getting dark and having to sleep outside. She had not dared leave the other woman out of sight the whole time she lay there near-death. So she went into the shuttle's scattered stores again and found a few tools. It took an hour or so, but she managed to get that puncture-hole pulled back and just wide enough to drag her friend through. It was full-on night by then, but she got them both inside and found the emergency rations. She tore into those with a fury despite how bad they tasted. That wasn't really what she was worried about.{&1310}\par It was hard to tell if her friend had improved by the next morning. She didn't seem like she moved much all night. And it took a few for Tess to get over her own stiff and aching parts from the crash. Her shoulder, especially, was killing her. She had to massage it for almost fifteen minutes before she could even get up. Evelyn still looked pale.{&1310}\par There was enough rations and water stored on board the shuttle for a little while, and she was pretty generous with spilling it all over her best friend's face while trying to get something down her throat. The other woman choked up a lot, and Tess freaked out a few times, thinking that she was drowning her. She was still sweating and weak, and Tess could hardly leave her side. But that didn't stop her from seeing her first sunrise on that planet.{&1310}\par An hour had almost gone by before she realized she had just been standing there, staring into the horizon. She snapped back to, but the sight stayed with her. She was sure she had never seen anything so beautiful before in her life. And she could almost get mad at Nolan for ruining the whole thing for her by dying.{&1310}\par That sent her off feeling guilty and terrible. She kicked around for a while after that, not sure just what she could do and poking her head in on Evelyn every so often. An unconscious woman wasn't much good for conversation, though, so she was left to either thinking apologetically to herself or talking out loud to no one. She got distracted by some birds flying about the tops of trees and the cacophony of caws and calls from hidden animals in the forest. It was deafening compared to Riftwatch. And, here, there were no people.{&1310}\par At some point, she got the idea to check on Nolan and the life pod. It wasn't far from where her shuttle had crashed, but she broke out in an anxious fit thinking about something happening to Evelyn while she was gone. Her legs still seemed to work well enough, even if her arm was still tender. Eventually, she worked up the courage to kick herself into gear under the condition that she run the whole way. It ended up being more of a jog, but she got back to the pod in under ten minutes easy.{&1310}\par There was a hope - small, and fragile - that Evelyn's father was still alive. It was harder to think of him as dead, remembering the indomitable stares, steely-eyed determination, and resolute steadfastness that he had approached everything with all the years she had known him.

She had seen him. She had seen him dead, and staring.{&1310}\par Hadn't she?{&1310}\par Something moved.{&1310}\par Her eyes snapped up, but there was nothing there. Just trees idling gently in the wind, rustling a thousand leaves. Her quick, shallow breathing still managed to drown everything else out. She glanced around. And then she noticed the other trail of blood.{&1310}\par Evelyn had bled out all the way back to shuttle - not much, but enough to leave a small trail. This other one, though ... it was much, much bigger. And it led in the other direction. Into the woods.{&1310}\par She followed that red-and-black mess with her eyes up to the treeline. It got dark after that, under the trees - hidden away from the daylight. She couldn't see anything further than a few dozen meters, but the trail didn't stop there.{&1310}\par Her tongue was thick in her throat.{&1310}\par "D ... Doctor Weir?" she called out.{&1310}\par Funny. No one answered.{&1310}\par She tried again.{&1310}\par "Doctor Weir!"{&1310}\par A little voice in the back of her head was telling her that no one could have left that much blood behind and still be alive. She fell back a few, halting steps with that thought nagging. But her eyes were stuck on that tangle of bark and brambles. She tried to call out again. The sound caught in her throat this time.{&1310}\par Something was moving. Something big. And something black. {&1310}\par The shadows under those trees shifted, and started toward the clearing. There was a moment then, of blind, overwhelming panic where her entire body just froze up in place on her. The next, and neither hands nor feet nor eyes knew which way they wanted to run. Eventually, though, she got her mouth moving at least.{&1310}\par "Shit!"{&1310}\par And then she bolted.{&1310}\par \cf2\f2 {&1310}\par }{&1310}
