Water rushed everywhere around me. I was drowning. I panicked and sucked it right into my lungs through my mouth.{&1310}\par My feet and hands kicked out in every direction at once and only hit glass. Someone had slammed a fist into it, and that voice came through muffled in my ears. I couldn't make out a word. I just started thrashing my own fists back against it.{&1310}\par "LET ME OUT!"{&1310}\par I tried to scream, but started choking instead. Bubbles shot up all around, blinding me. I was drowning in a glass tube with nowhere to go. I punched the glass until my knuckles broke open and faint whisps of blood were in the water. I couldn't see. There were supposed to be failsafes. WHY THE HELL WEREN'T THE FAILSAFES TURNING ON?!{&1310}\par "Emergency release, activated."{&1310}\par The world rushed away from me all at once and my head pitched forward into the glass. It parted once the water was all gone and my knees gave way. I was suddenly drowning in air and flung forward out onto the deck.{&1310}\par I still couldn't see. That automated warning chirped in a sterile female voice was ringing in my ears as I tried to push the deck away from my face. It wasn't working too well.{&1310}\par "You failed to reactivate, cadet."{&1310}\par The boots of that someone who'd pounded on my glass were standing right in front of me. I recognized them. They were smart, polished, and immaculate. I just sputtered and choked up water from inside me.{&1310}\par "This glass," he rapped some knuckles against my open tube, "is part of a device meant to withstand and protect your body from high-velocity G's that would otherwise liquefy your skeleton." He said it loud enough that his voice bounced off the walls. He didn't just say it for me. "But Cadet Weir thought that she could break through it instead of using her manual release." {&1310}\par He abruptly got down real low beside my ear.{&1310}\par "Just what the fuck did you think you were going to do, Weir? Destroy a million-dollar piece of equipment just to save your worthless ass from drowning? Even if it \i were\i0  possible -- this thing's worth a helluva lot more to me than you are."{&1310}\par There were people up and about and moving quickly inside the cabin. I was the only one on the floor still in my tube suit. I still couldn't breathe.{&1310}\par "That's what happens when you forget to use the very tools that got you here, people," he finished off for the rest of them. "So move, move, move it! Come on, Crowley! Move your ass up out that drop bay!"{&1310}\par The cabin was almost empty by the time he got back around to me on the floor.{&1310}\par "Get up, cadet." He stood and came back around in front of me again. "You didn't swallow any tank water. You had an air tube in your mouth the whole time."{&1310}\par I looked down for any holes in my chest, but there were none. It still hurt. It hurt just like it had hurt inside the dream. My hand hurt too, but that was fresh, and my head. I still could barely see past all that black. It had seeped into me.{&1310}\par "I said get the fuck up off my deck!"{&1310}\par My eyes blinked up at the fury of motion all around me, but I still had double-vision of that man in the dark. Real shapes started to come back in a rush so abruptly it made me want to turn inside out.{&1310}\par "WEIR!"{&1310}\par A hand grabbed me hard and tried to pull me up. But I just puked up all over his nice, clean boots.\cf2\f1 {&1310}\par \pard\sl0\slmult1\cf1\f2 {&1310}\par }{&1310}
