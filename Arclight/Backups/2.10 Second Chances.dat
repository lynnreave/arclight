It wasn't over ... just yet.{&1310}\par I stumbled back over to the bed, shaking all over. I tried to get it under control.{&1310}\par "Someone has to get you out of here," I breathed.

"\i Someone\i0  has to get you out of here." {&1310}\par I latched onto both her arms. {&1310}\par "Even if you're," I heaved up, and dragged her right up off the bed and tried to lean her against me, "just planning on dying on me on the way!" {&1310}\par She was an inch or two taller than me, though.

But what I really wanted to do was to kick her head in so hard her teeth fell right out. Or she woke up. Whichever happened first. And then I was going to find that stupid Eluvian man and stick my gun so far down his throat he ...{&1310}\par I got to all the short way to the treeline before I tripped again. My shoulder suddenly decided to flare up and twinge like someone hacked it with a rusty knife. I collapsed with a shriek, dropping Ev like a sack of ... well a sack of something, gods damnit!{&1310}\par "No, no, NO!" I whined and snarled through my teeth, rolling around on the ground and cradling that side. It hurt and throbbed so bad I thought I would die. But not me. I still had my legs. No, it was the other woman I twisted back around in the dirt on then.{&1310}\par "Fuck you, Ev!"{&1310}\par I glared for a few seconds. "Fuck you!" Then a few more.

I was all but crying out hysterically, caught between watching her die and knowing I couldn't do anything about it, when the trees above creaked over, thrashing with the sudden, violent gust. I looked up in surprise, to watch something else follow after that first thing. A ship. Another ship. And a third flashed by, all three vanishing past the canopy.{&1310}\par I froze for a minute. Just watching. Listening. {&1310}\par Waiting.{&1310}\par Then they came back.{&1310}\par "HEY!"{&1310}\par I waved my one good arm as wildly as I could. I jumped back to my feet, ran back out into the open, and leapt up into the air, waving in a frenzy as two of those three ships whipped past again. And a third time, half a minute later.{&1310}\par "HEY! HEY!" I bounced. "DOWN HERE!"{&1310}\par It was too much to hope that they could see me, buried there in the trees. But I jumped, and I jumped high with that low gravity. The crashed ship was still smoking too, trailing wisps up toward the clouds before they were blow away. Maybe they saw it. Maybe they saw me. They did keep circling back.{&1310}\par I leapt up again. I had never stopped since I realized a second chance I couldn't possibly let go. Ev still lay back in the trees on the ground, dying slowly. I was dancing around so that anyone bothering to look at anything down there must have seen me. But it was one of those times I jumped that I never came back down.{&1310}\par Something snatched me in mid-air from behind. It choked me right in the middle of screaming at the top of my lungs, hit me below the waist, and rolled me right back over. I flipped in the air - landed hard on my stomach a second later. My lungs crushed down to nothing and I lay there not breathing.{&1310}\par Someone yelled something at me. For a second, I thought it was Ev, as I slowly blinked back up, feeling the collapsed void in my throat. Then I was staring dumbly at that Eluvian man, scrambling back to his feet before I could even put two thoughts together again.{&1310}\par He got real close to my stricken face, and shouted.{&1310}\par "I said \i move\i0 !"{&1310}\par I blinked at him, not understanding one bit. I wondered if he had come back to finish me and Ev off for some reason. He grabbed at my hand and started to pull. It was the bad one, so my shoulder burst into a blinding pain. And I screamed.{&1310}\par Howling filled the air. I wasn't sure where it came from, but light suddenly filled it too. Heat blasted me like a furnace and everywhere around us exploded into fire and heat and screaming. I wasn't sure if it was me or him or what, but my ears went numb before I realized I wasn't being dragged anymore.{&1310}\par I rolled over onto my back, moaning aloud. At least, I thought it was out loud. I couldn't quite hear it, though. Everything was muffled. My shoulder throbbed. I found myself staring up at the sky and watching as one of those ships seemed to just drift overhead. I did manage to hear that thundering engine a second later after it roared past, even through my haze. It vanished beyond the trees once more.{&1310}\par There were a lot less of those trees now. I noticed that as my eyes drifted down a little and saw where they had been sliced cleanly away at an angle from above. All the rest were in flames, burning up into the sky in places. I watched for a few seconds, not quite feeling yet. Then I groaned.{&1310}\par "Ev ..."{&1310}\par I tried to pick myself back up. I was away from the clearing where the Eluvian's ship had crashed again, pulled back into the trees. I couldn't remember when that had happened, but I suddenly saw that man bent over and ducking beneath the top end of one of those slaughtered trees. He hauled something out from underneath it, hefted it over one shoulder, and rounded back towards me.{&1310}\par It took me a while. But I realized it was Ev.{&1310}\par "Get up!" he snapped at me like the crack of a whip on my bruised brain. It was coming back. Slowly.{&1310}\par "... What?" I groaned back at him, pulling myself gradually back up and so on top of things.{&1310}\par But he just snatched a fistful of my jacket as he scrambled past and hauled me up across the ground without even stopping. It gave me a good chance to watch as the next barrage of fiery light splattered down across and ahead of the clearing where I had been standing last. The ground shook and vanished in huge chunks. The trees that were left melted and burst into flame. And the Eluvian man dropped his grip on me. I came to a sudden stop in the dirt.{&1310}\par "I'm not carrying you both the whole way," he growled down in my ear. "Get up, and follow me!"{&1310}\par I rolled over a little listlessly without thinking. I did manage to throw my jellied body back up on shaking legs and watch as he turned with Ev on his back and barreled away through the trees. {&1310}\par Those ships were gunning down the entire forest around the crash behind. I didn't think much about going back that way. And that man was stealing my best friend, besides. {&1310}\par It took a few seconds, but I stumbled after those two, deeper into the woods. The whole while, it lit up like a beacon from gunfire behind.\cf2\f1 {&1310}\par }{&1310}

The water situation wasn't much better.{&1310}\par I rummaged some more. Threw a few things around. Even screamed a couple times at empty space and lockers. When I got tired of that, I stalked around the ruined cabin with clenched teeth until I found the gun again. I looked at Ev for another long while. Then I tucked the thing into my pocket.{&1310}\par It was all coming apart around me again.{&1310}\par No. {&1310}\par \i No\i0 .{&1310}\par Not yet. It wasn't over ... just yet.{&1310}\par I stumbled back over to the bed, shaking all over. I tried to get it under control.{&1310}\par "Someone has to get you out of here," I breathed. {&1310}\par Then I repeated it, grinding down in my throat. {&1310}\par "\i Someone\i0  has to get you out of here." {&1310}\par I latched onto both her arms. {&1310}\par "Even if you're," I heaved up, and dragged her right up off the bed and tried to lean her against me, "just planning on dying on me anyway!" {&1310}\par She was an inch or two taller than me, though. And nothing but limp, flapping limbs. The lower gravity only kept me from falling completely over.{&1310}\par "Fine! Have it your way." {&1310}\par She collapsed down to the floor but I kept a hold on both her arms. I started to haul her along out of the cabin toward the hatch. {&1310}\par "I'll just drag your," I panted over the lip of the exit ramp, "fat ass all the way to wherever he's going!"{&1310}\par Yeah. That's what I'd do. Maybe he wouldn't stay and help us, but he must have known where he was going. I didn't. But I could follow him, couldn't I? Too bad I had wasted so much time already.{&1310}\par We skipped down the ramp on the balls of my feet, a few steps at a time. But she got heavy again and her shoe caught at the end. I heaved, and pulled, and I abruptly lost my grip and went over into the ground. I scrambled right back up.{&1310}\par "COME ON, EV!"{&1310}\par I screamed at her. Then I snatched her hands up again and kept dragging through the dirt and grass. But what I really wanted to do was to kick her head in so hard her teeth fell right out. Or she woke up. Whichever happened first. And then I was going to find that stupid eluvian man and stick my gun so far down his throat he ...{&1310}\par I got to all the short way to the treeline before I tripped again. My shoulder suddenly decided to flare up and twinge like someone hacked it with a rusty knife. I collapsed with a shriek, dropping Ev like a sack of ... well, something anyways. Not that I cared much about that for a moment just then.{&1310}\par "No, no, NO!" {&1310}\par I whined and snarled through my teeth, rolling around on the ground and cradling that side. It hurt and throbbed so bad I thought I would die. But not me. No. No, I still had my legs. She was the one who wouldn't make it. I could still run for it on my own. \i She \i0 was the one doing nothing but laying there dying on me. {&1310}\par I twisted back around on her in the dirt.{&1310}\par "Fuck you, Ev!"{&1310}\par I glared for a few seconds. "Fuck you!" Then a few more. Then my boots were slapping dirt in a flurry right at the back of her head.{&1310}\par "You hear me?"{&1310}\par I scrambled over until I was right in her ear.{&1310}\par "I said - FUUUUUCK YOUUU, EV!" I shrieked. {&1310}\par "WAKE UP!"{&1310}\par Something swooped overhead before I got around to slapping her with my good hand. I was all but crying out hysterically when the trees above creaked over, thrashing with the sudden, violent gust. I looked up in surprise, to watch something else follow after that first thing. A ship. Another ship. And a third flashed by, all three vanishing past the canopy.{&1310}\par I froze for a minute. Just watching. Listening. {&1310}\par Waiting.{&1310}\par Then they came back.{&1310}\par "HEY!"{&1310}\par I waved my one good arm as wildly as I could. I jumped back to my feet, ran back out into the open, and leapt up into the air, waving in a frenzy as two of those three ships whipped past again. And a third time, half a minute later.{&1310}\par "HEY! HEY!" I bounced. "DOWN HERE!"{&1310}\par It was too much to hope that they could see me, buried there in the trees. But I jumped, and I jumped high with that low gravity. The crashed ship was still smoking too, trailing wisps up toward the clouds before they were blow away. Maybe they saw it. Maybe they saw me. They did keep circling back.{&1310}\par I leapt up again. I had never stopped since I realized a second chance I couldn't possibly let go. Ev still lay back in the trees on the ground, dying slowly. I was dancing around so that anyone bothering to look at anything down there must have seen me. But it was one of those times I jumped that I never came back down.{&1310}\par Something snatched me in mid-air from behind. It choked me right in the middle of screaming at the top of my lungs, hit me below the waist, and rolled me right back over. I flipped in the air, landing hard on my stomach a second later. My lungs crushed down to nothing and I lay there not breathing.{&1310}\par Someone yelled something at me. For a second, I thought it was Ev, as I slowly blinked back up, feeling the collapsed void in my throat. Then I was staring dumbly at that eluvian man, scrambling back to his feet before I could even put two thoughts together again.{&1310}\par He got real close to my stricken face, and shouted.{&1310}\par "I said \i move\i0 !"{&1310}\par I blinked at him, not understanding one bit. I wondered if he had come back to finish me and Ev off for some reason. He grabbed at my hand and started to pull. It was the bad one, so my shoulder burst into a blinding pain. And I screamed.{&1310}\par Howling filled the air. I wasn't sure where it came from, but light suddenly filled it too. Heat blasted me like a furnace and everywhere around us exploded into fire and heat and screaming. I wasn't sure if it was me or him or what, but my ears went numb before I realized I wasn't being dragged anymore.{&1310}\par I rolled over onto my back, moaning aloud. At least, I thought it was out loud. I couldn't quite hear it, though. Everything was muffled. My shoulder throbbed. I found myself staring up at the sky and watching as one of those ships seemed to just drift overhead. I did manage to hear that thundering engine a second later after it roared past, even through my haze. It vanished beyond the trees once more.{&1310}\par There were a lot less of those trees now. I noticed that as my eyes drifted down a little and saw where they had been sliced cleanly away at an angle from above. All the rest were in flames, burning up into the sky in places. I watched for a few seconds, not quite feeling yet. Then I groaned.{&1310}\par "Ev ..."{&1310}\par I tried to pick myself back up. I was away from the clearing where the eluvian's ship had crashed again, pulled back into the trees. I couldn't remember when that had happened, but I suddenly saw that man bent over and ducking beneath the top end of one of those slaughtered trees. He hauled something out from underneath it, hefted it over one shoulder, and rounded back towards me.{&1310}\par It took me a while. But I realized it was Ev.{&1310}\par "Get up!" he snapped at me like the crack of a whip on my bruised brain. It was coming back. Slowly.{&1310}\par "... What?" I groaned back at him, pulling myself gradually back up and so on top of things.{&1310}\par But he just snatched a fistful of my jacket as he scrambled past and hauled me up across the ground without even stopping. It gave me a good chance to watch as the next barrage of fiery light splattered down across and ahead of the clearing where I had been standing last. The ground shook and vanished in huge chunks. The trees that were left melted and burst into flame. And the eluvian man dropped his grip on me. I came to a sudden stop in the dirt.{&1310}\par "I'm not carrying you both the whole way," he growled down in my ear. "Get up, and follow me!"{&1310}\par I rolled over a little listlessly without thinking. I did manage to throw my jellied body back up on shaking legs and watch as he turned with Ev on his back and barreled away through the trees. {&1310}\par Those ships were gunning down the entire forest around the crash behind. I didn't think much about going back that way. And that man was stealing my best friend, besides. {&1310}\par It took a few seconds, but I stumbled after those two, deeper into the woods. The whole while, it lit up like a beacon from gunfire behind.\cf2\f1 {&1310}\par }{&1310}

I guess I knew what was coming as soon as I saw that man walk away and leave us there to die. But I trudged along anyways, swiping at my eyes with the backs of my hands until they weren't dry enough to clear anything up anymore. The world was a blur by the time I reached Ev back at the broken ship. And I just stared at her for a long time, standing there.{&1310}\par I was pretty sure no one else would be coming along anytime soon. The only other people that had, the Eluvian had shot up and run off. Not that they had seemed too friendly, firing first and all. Maybe they had just been firing on a known criminal, or something - maybe not. It would have been easy to hate him just then, but I wasn't that stupid. He could have killed us - \i would\i0  have killed us, if he'd wanted to. Especially after I tried to hijack his ship, even if I wasn't about to just leave him behind instead. Why just tie us up and ask me all those questions? He didn't care about us. He hadn't even been looking for us at all.{&1310}\par I hauled Ev's dead weight back up onto the bunk and slumped down beside her. It was an improvement to the floor, at least. But I couldn't help thinking about how I had been the one to take her out of that lifepod. She would have died in there, sure ... I thought. But now she was just dying a little bit slower - because I had been dumb enough to pull her out. I never even stopped to \i think \i0 about bacteria, or infection, or ... whatever, from some backwater planet. Not that I had ever had to worry about anything like that before.{&1310}\par Telling myself that didn't help anything much, though. Nothing got better. My mood got worse. Tears burned at my swollen eyes again. I looked at Ev - pale as death, and looking like she was already there.{&1310}\par No one else was coming. Not soon enough for her to make it anyways. Even if what the Eluvian had said wasn't true and she did hang on - we would run out of food soon. I busied myself with checking what the man might have left behind just to keep my hands from shaking - which amounted to not much at all. I guess he had been traveling light, or else really grabbed everything edible before running off, and there had been barely anything left after Nolan was done with the shuttle. The water situation wasn't much better.{&1310}\par I rummaged some more. Threw a few things around. Even screamed a couple times at empty space and lockers.
