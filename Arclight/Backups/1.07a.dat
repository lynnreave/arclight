The bay manager gave him some room before rounding on his two dockhands.{&1310}\par "Hal?"{&1310}\par "Boss?"{&1310}\par "Go figure out where she crawled out of like this.{&1310}\par "Kendrick?"{&1310}\par "Yeah?"{&1310}\par "Get back to work." {&1310}\par Both men trudged off in different directions, and Fitzpatrick came back around.{&1310}\par "I'm real sorry about this, Weir," he apologized, looking distraught. "Not sure what could have done something like this around here. Unless she got too close too one of the exhaust ports, or something."{&1310}\par Nolan didn't look at him, checking over the girl instead. "It's not your fault, Dane," he told him simply, peeling back open that ragged old brown jacket of hers to get a better look. There was a lot of scarring. Burns covered her face and hands. That raven-black hair of hers had taken the brunt of it from the skin on the back of her neck down to the shoulders where it stopped. Huge tufts had been scorched away. Then the jacket took the rest of it, pitted with ash in no few places too.{&1310}\par He looked down at that mess. And kept his face straight.{&1310}\par "What can you do for her, Thaddeus?" he asked back at the other man.{&1310}\par "She'll lose how it happened and everything after. Maybe a few minutes before too."{&1310}\par "That's fine," Nolan told him, still not taking his eyes away. "She's better off not knowing."{&1310}\par The older man shrugged his shoulders behind, puffing out at his white beard and moustaches. Then, without another word, he bent over beside Weir and put his hands above the girl.{&1310}\par Nolan waited as patiently as he could while Thaddeus closed his eyes and mumbled his supplications to the ether. It took some time, but then he was watching as pink, healthy flesh swarmed over the burned and cracked ribs mended underneath. Hair that had been burned away regrew until all those seared holes and patches were filled. A minute passed, and it was suddenly as if nothing had happened to her at all.{&1310}\par Weir looked up.{&1310}\par "Thank you."{&1310}\par By then, Hal Fengler was jogging back over toward them. He had another man in tow. That one hung back a step at the sight of Nolan Weir's daughter sprawled out looking lifeless, but whole now, on the deck. Hal did a double-take of his own on coming back over.{&1310}\par "Found the hatch to the maintenance tunnels open," the man said, sticking a thumb back over his shoulder. "Looks like someone cracked the combo on it."{&1310}\par Nolan looked to Fitzpatrick and the bay manager bobbed his head at Fengler. "Thanks, Hal," he said. And dismissed the men. {&1310}\par He stood.{&1310}\par "I'll call the Warden and have him get some boys down there to check it out."{&1310}\par "Please do, Dane," Thaddeus chimed in then, glancing up at him from under those thick, white eyebrows. When the bay manager was gone, he turned them back on Nolan. He lowered that rasping voice even further.{&1310}\par "This will escalate quickly, Nolan. Whoever did this has been waiting some time to strike."{&1310}\par "Twenty years is hardly a short time, Thaddeus," the younger of the two old men grunted back. "But you're right. I knew thing would move quickly once they did."{&1310}\par "I doubt that your enemies have merely waited all this time," the other chided him once more.{&1310}\par "No," Weir agreed. Then reached down and swept the unconscious girl up from the ground. "But neither have I." He carried her back over toward where they had a shuttle prepared and waiting, only stopping long enough to grab the backpack she had been carrying. The other two bags he left witha  look for Thaddeus. The older man nodded.{&1310}\par "Have you decided where you will go yet?" the Head Archivist asked, hanging near the shuttle's open hatch while Nolan moved around inside. He glanced up, briefly.{&1310}\par "Dreggor's Door," he told the other, still entering commands and hovering over consoles. "We can lose ourselves in the crowds there." It was a simple enough plan, to be sure. Thaddeus agreed.{&1310}\par "And what if they anticipate you fleeing Riftwatch at the first sign of trouble?" he probed.{&1310}\par "Doubtful," Nolan said, continuing. "They'll assume that their sleeper agent did the job or else that we'd be tied up worrying about her safety. Either way, they couldn't expect us to react so quickly as this." He went to work strapping the unconscious girl now into a chair.{&1310}\par "You are assuming, of course," the other pressed with an arched brow, "that they are not as clever or prepared as you, Nolan. Or that they did not spend the same twenty years plotting every move the other would make when the time came," he chided. And Weir looked up at him over the girl.{&1310}\par "I know that."{&1310}\par "I wish you luck, Nolan," Thaddeus said then with a wave of his hand beyond the rear hatch. It began to swing shut to a soft mechanical whine.{&1310}\par "Thank you," Weir told him through the shrinking hole. He did not join him in that wave. "I doubt we'll see each other again." The last, the other did not hear. The hatch had swallowed him up whole.{&1310}\par Nolan returned to the pilot's chair and strapped himself in.{&1310}\par }{&1310}
