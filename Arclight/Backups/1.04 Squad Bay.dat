It was a little cubby in the squad bay with our two racks facing opposite around a shared terminal hookup for reading up on course material and calling home, mostly. Not that Komi ever used it.

I skimmed through the messages on the terminal, but they were almost all from Tess. Komi didn't get messages on it.

But it was the worn-out laugh of a cadet who'd been in the field on exercises all week. We'd just gotten back last night and who knew how long it would be until Morisant would come stomping into the squad bay again. No one was silly enough to believe the training schedules they issued anymore except in broad strokes.{&1310}\par "They'll let you come back," she told me, gently. "If you still want to come back."{&1310}\par I pulled back from gliding over Tess' latest message, though, sighing. "No they won't. Morisant already pretty much told me I'm not getting picked up for any advanced training."{&1310}\par "What?" she rolled over off her rack and waved a hand at the door and it slid shut. She looked at me and got serious. "He said \i that\i0 ?"{&1310}\par I shrugged. "I haven't shown any potential."{&1310}\par It was mostly true. I hadn't shown any signs of talent, and even though not everyone did in basic training - most did. Almost everyone else had in our cadet unit. Morisant had made some veiled threats about me staying home after leave that didn't sound very fake either.{&1310}\par "Neither has Sully!"{&1310}\par Again, I shrugged.

Don't you even know why they give us this week off before final evaluations?"{&1310}\par "What do you mean?"{&1310}\par "They \i know\i0  most cadets get their breakthrough right before they come back if they haven't made it by then.

I'd kept myself as busy as I could studying tactics, military principles, and advanced psychokinetic techniques in the assigned text compilation on my terminal. For what good it might do. It mostly just helped me feel less like the unwanted stepchild thrown back on the ship because she couldn't cut it. But that was exactly why.{&1310}\par The other cadets swarmed back into the squad bay. I'd tried to preoccupy myself and look busy, but I didn't feel it. That familiar dread and self-awareness came flooding back in with them. They all looked tired, and that made me feel tired. But it was empathetic and didn't help me feel less like the biggest PoS in the unit for being the only one freshly dressed and rested while everyone else had been roughing it so hard out in the field.{&1310}\par I got out of my bunk when Kominshk practically fell into the entryway to our shared cubby. Her whole body slumped and her brown, drooping eyes blinked exhaustedly at me out of her sweaty, brown face.{&1310}\par "You missed a hell of a run, Weir."{&1310}\par "I know."{&1310}\par She actually did fall into her bunk on the opposite side of the terminal we shared between them. And she laid there without making a sound, looking like she'd just passed out. I could see the rest of the cadets getting undressed from the field or lounging about outside our bunkhole and I thought about going out there. I felt like I needed to be seen to be remembered, but I didn't want anyone to see me. Not after how I'd fallen behind. The choice got taken away from me, though. A familiar, loud, booming voice erupted into the squad bay calling everyone to attention.{&1310}\par I heard Kominshk groan on the bed behind me, but that didn't stop her from catapulting herself back onto her feet on the deck. I strode out and came to attention to one side of our bunks, and she appeared a second later on the other side. We were staring at Hammar and Stevens across from us, rigid and frozen in place.

It was a little cubby in the squad bay with our two racks facing opposite around a shared terminal hookup for reading up on course material and calling home, mostly. Not that Komi ever used it. Her parents had paid to put one of those newer implants in her head. You could always tell when she was linked in because her brown eyes lit up an iridiscent blue.{&1310}\par "What'd they say?"{&1310}\par "Nothing new." I skimmed through the messages on the terminal, but they were almost all from Tess. Komi didn't get messages on it. They got sent straight to her head.{&1310}\par She was lying on her rack, staring up at the ceiling with a blank look on her face. When she was done, she switched off and her eyes changes colors. She looked at me.{&1310}\par "You know we're going home next week, right?"{&1310}\par "I know."{&1310}\par "You don't seem too excited."{&1310}\par "I am."{&1310}\par She laughed. But it was the worn-out laugh of a cadet who'd been in the field on exercises all week. We'd just gotten back last night and who knew how long it would be until Morisant would come stomping into the squad bay again. No one was silly enough to believe the training schedules they issued anymore except in broad strokes.{&1310}\par "They'll let you come back," she told me, gently. "If you still want to come back."{&1310}\par I pulled back from gliding over Tess' latest message, though, sighing. "No they won't. Morisant already pretty much told me I'm not getting picked up for any advanced training."{&1310}\par "What?" she rolled over off her rack and waved a hand at the door and it slid shut. She looked at me and got serious. "He said \i that\i0 ?"{&1310}\par I shrugged. "I haven't shown any potential."{&1310}\par It was mostly true. I hadn't shown any signs of talent, and even though not everyone did in basic training - most did. Almost everyone else had in our cadet unit. Morisant had made some veiled threats about me staying home after leave that didn't sound very fake either.{&1310}\par "Neither has Sully!"{&1310}\par Again, I shrugged. I wasn't really sure what else to say. I wasn't thinking about Morisant or the next level of training at all really. I was thinking about back home and what it would be like to step off knowing I wouldn't be leaving again.{&1310}\par "Come on, Weir," Kominshk "Your dad's like one of the top private contractors in the sector! I mean, you grew \i up\i0  on Riftwatch station ... how could they \i not\i0  pick you up?"{&1310}\par "You know, none of that stuff about radiation has actually been proven, right?"{&1310}\par "You've still got it in your genes. Only implants guarantee talent more than that."{&1310}\par "Well, I don't have any. You know that."{&1310}\par "Oh my god. You keep saying that and making it true. You've barely even tried!"{&1310}\par "I've tried, okay? Just because it's easy for you doesn't mean it has to be easy for me."{&1310}\par "Look. You're going to be fine. Go home and stop worrying about it so much. It's the stress that's blocking you, just like it blocks everyone else. Don't you even know why they give us this week off before final evaluations?"{&1310}\par "What do you mean?"{&1310}\par "They \i know\i0  most cadets get their breakthrough right before they come back if they haven't made it by then. You should read up on this stuff more. You'd worry about it less."{&1310}\par "Is that really true?"{&1310}\par "Uh, yeah. You really should look into it. A \i lot\i0  of people go through the same thing you're going through.{&1310}\par {&1310}\par {&1310}\par I heard Kominshk groan on the bed behind me, but that didn't stop her from catapulting herself back onto her feet on the deck. I strode out and came to attention to one side of our bunks, and she appeared a second later on the other side. We were staring at Hammar and Stevens across from us, rigid and frozen in place. Like toy soldiers completely devoid of life and emotion. But you could see it in their eyes. Those were alive and full of thoughts about whatever was coming next as the lieutenant stood smartly and impatiently at the head of the squad bay.{&1310}\par Stevens' eyes met mine and stuck there for a second.
