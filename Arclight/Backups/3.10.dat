That Eluvian man was standing in front of me.{&1310}\par I'd been spacing out ... or something. Everyone was suddenly somewhere different like I'd leapt forward in time. Julian was giving me a scrutinizing look.{&1310}\par "Weir," he continued. At first, I thought I'd heard dad's voice. It changed to Julian's way too fast.{&1310}\par "That\i  is\i0  your name. Right?"{&1310}\par I looked over at Tess, slumped in one of the control chairs and staring at nothing. That security officer - Richter, he'd said his name was, Herman Richter - looked like he'd found an emergency medkit and was trying to figure out what was wrong with that comatose engineer. I hoped we could keep that train going without him because he looked like a corpse already decomposing. We'd managed to get the thing started and moving, at least.{&1310}\par "What?" I came back around to Julian again. I'd forgotten what he'd said.{&1310}\par "Evelyn Weir," he asked again with some tried patience. "If that's right, then this had you identified by name."{&1310}\par He held up that comm unit he'd taken from the dead man back at the bar who'd attacked Tess. His voice was low and he kept his back to the others. I realized he was trying not to let them see it or hear him of a sudden.{&1310}\par "They were after you, and someone knew exactly what planet you'd be on. You crashed here, didn't you?"{&1310}\par "We were ... I was attacked." I shrugged. "The life pod took me here."{&1310}\par "Well this is old. Older than your attack I'd guess, by at least a few weeks. Those two must have been waiting here in the main port all this time. For you, specifically.{&1310}\par "What ...?"{&1310}\par It was hard to make sense of at first. Too much, too fast, on top of everything else, and I was still reeling. He didn't bother to answer me or clarify, though, and I felt suddenly overwhelmed and completely out of sorts. He just studied my face for that reaction. I guess I must have looked confused.{&1310}\par Eventually, he turned away.{&1310}\par The town hovered on the horizon for a moment before being swallowed up by some gaping maw. It closed in all around us almost instantly, cutting off the morning light but for a perfectly circular hole in the end. Then that squeezed shut too.{&1310}\par We entered a tunnel. One that sealed off the outside world and sucked out all the atmosphere from around the train to the placid, accented tones of a female voice over the comms. I only paid it half a mind. We picked up speed once we were in vacuum, and the gentle lilting of before vanished. Gravitonic plating activated to compensate, and then there was nothing to let us know we were moving at all. Looking out the front port before it finished closing, though, made me want to vomit.{&1310}\par "What's wrong with him?" {&1310}\par Julian had rounded back on Richter by the time I plopped myself down in one of the revolving control chairs. If I didn't concentrate too hard, I wouldn't feel the subtle sensation of sliding.{&1310}\par The security officer shook his head quickly. "I'm not really, ah ... trained, for this sort of thing," he stammered out, swiping a shaky hand back through his sweaty, blond hair. Julian might not have had a gun pointed at him at the moment, but he still had three to the other man's none, with the pistol resting easy in one hand.{&1310}\par The Eluvian looked the engineer over again. I suppose he looked worse than before. The veins on his arms looked black as they poked out from his paper skin beneath a ripped and bloody shirt. I imagined he'd come running out of the town when that thing attacked, and tried to escape on the train by himself. The crew must have been staying for the night while they loaded up. {&1310}\par "Do you know?" Richter ventured with a tentative look. Julian met him with his usual hard-faced glare.{&1310}\par "He's dead, one way or another," was what Julian told him, tracing the air above those blackened veins with a fingertip. "Get rid of him. We should have tossed the body back before we left."{&1310}\par "But he might still be ..."{&1310}\par The other man protested at first. But he stopped at the sight of the pistol clapping down on the engineer's body.{&1310}\par "Do it."{&1310}\par While they worked on getting that almost-corpse out of the control car, I studied Tess. She didn't notice, slouched over there and staring at the floor. I thought I should say something to her, but the right words wouldn't come and she was better than me at that sort of thing. What were you supposed to say after all that? I wished she'd never come out there with us. I wished she'd stayed safe back home with Bertram instead of chasing off after dad and me.{&1310}\par I thought about that and those thoughts inevitably turned around to her headless body back in the room. I'd seen it. I'd \i felt\i0  it. She had been dead in my arms. But now she wasn't, and I couldn't begin to figure out why. I wanted to chase it out as just a delusional nightmare, but I couldn't for long. Something about it had felt way too real, and, somehow, her sitting there now did not.{&1310}\par As I watched, a funny thing happened, though. The more I focused on that thought, the more I noticed something else. It was subtle at first - console lights seeming to flicker out of turn. The feel of the cabin vibrating, and not in the way it was from shooting through that tunnel. No ... it was like the fibers of things were trying to stand apart from each other right there in front of me the longer and harder I stared at them.{&1310}\par A hand stretched out in front of me and it took me a minute to realize whose it was. Mine. I pulled back, but not before I noticed how it didn't pop out and tremble like everything else around me just then. It was almost see-through, like it belonged to some kind of ephemeral ghost. And I might have just stared in detached shock and horror at that forever had I not noticed everything else around me doubling and tripling and quadrupling with ghosts and shades of their own in hundreds - thousands - of slightly differing pieces all stacked up on top of each other until anything and everything was suddenly buried in a rising cacophony of visual white noise and-{&1310}\par "Estimated arrival time ... fifteen minutes and fifty-two seconds."{&1310}\par That robotic female voice chimed and thundered with a hundred different numbers and sounds from a thousand different directions. It hit me abruptly like the onset of gravity, and I felt myself hurtled back down into place. Everything settled around me again in an angry, violent rush.{&1310}\par And I did throw up then.\cf2\f1 {&1310}\par }{&1310}
