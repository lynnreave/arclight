All kinds of freaks and perverts might end up with your comm address ..."{&1310}\par I ran my hands back through my hair, throwing it out loose from the ponytail I kept for regulation. I wasn't awake enough yet to answer that kind of veiled threat in kind.{&1310}\par "Did you just wake up?" she chirped, reading my groggy thoughts. There was no one to impress by cleaning up each morning here in the lonely squad bay, but I did it anyways. {&1310}\par "Yeah. You can't tell?" I was pretty sure that holo imaging could broadcast just how ugly and tired I looked. I never got enough sleep while training, and now being restricted to my bunk had me getting too much for my body to handle.{&1310}\par "You always look sick and tired when you call," she told me, shrugging her shoulders in the holo. "Anyways - what happened this time?"{&1310}\par I told her about the episode in the anti-grav pod. Another life-like nightmare, and another series of splitting headaches ebbing my performance to death. It was bad enough I'd shown no talent when they accepted me into the program or in the months since. I was pretty sure that Dad was the only reason I'd gotten in at all.{&1310}\par "Sorry," she said without really meaning it much. I think she leaned in, but the holo stayed with her. I could make out faint traces of her room back on Riftwatch station in the residual imaging. {&1310}\par "What are they having you do now?"{&1310}\par "Wait around for Morisant and the other cadets to get back." I shook my head. "I'm not supposed to leave the command ship. How are things back home?"{&1310}\par "Pffft, like you really care. If it wasn't for Lieutenant More-Asshat, you'd never even want to come back."{&1310}\par "Oh I know, right?" I dipped my head to the flattop hosting the terminal and rolled my forehead against it. The less time I got to think about it, the less depressing the whole situation was. And I had nothing but time right now. I think they meant it that way - as a sort of punishment. I might end up thinking myself to death.{&1310}\par "It won't matter, though," I grumbled through my hands, heaving out a sigh. "I can't \i do\i0  anything. My scores are terrible and everyone in command hates me." I looked up at her. "I'm pretty sure all my squadmates do too."{&1310}\par "I know your favorite commanding officer has been trying to get rid of you for a while now." She laughed, because \i she\i0  wasn't the one who had to deal with it. She had no idea what kind of a living hell he could make my life each day before I even woke up. "You should hear what he says about you to \i his\i0  boss."{&1310}\par "Oh God, I don't even want to think about it," I groaned. And I tried not to. But then I blinked back up at her. "You went into his private comms?"{&1310}\par She bobbed her head with that little smirk she gave me whenever she managed to do anything she could brag about because she didn't get caught. When she \i did\i0  get caught, it was a whole lot more "fuck that guy"'s and "I'm gonna start fucking with him so hard"'s tumbling vengefully out of her mouth instead. {&1310}\par "Oh yeah," she said instead this time, though. She was proud of herself for finding her way into a commissioned officer's private correspondence. "And I might have made a few improvements to his reports," she added. "You'd like them."{&1310}\par "Oh my God, what did you do? You didn't touch them, did you?" {&1310}\par A stupid question, and I'd get a stupid answer. I already knew what she'd done by that look on her face.{&1310}\par She shook her head, still grinning at me way too big. She really didn't understand how much she could screw me over doing that kind of shit. "I don't think they'll be kicking you out anytime soon," she told me happily, however, being purposefully vague. But I just got this suddenly overwhelming sinking feeling all over like I'd been doused with a bucket of ice water and dread. I would have reached out and shook her if the holo had been real instead of transmitting her from a hundred million kilometers away.{&1310}\par "Do you know what they'll do to you if they find out?" I demanded, incredulously. "Do you know what they'll do to \i me\i0 ?" Throw me out of the training program for sure. Maybe even throw me off the station. What the hell could I even \i say \i0 to Dad if that happened?{&1310}\par "It doesn't matter. They won't."{&1310}\par "Tess ..."{&1310}\par "Hey, shut up," she said. "I did you a favor, okay? And it wasn't easy either, so ... just go with it." She shrugged. "Just pretend like I never said anything to you about it. You know?"{&1310}\par I shook my head, squeezing my eyes shut. It wasn't like this was the first time she'd found her way into somewhere she didn't belong and dragged me along with her. It was usually harmless, most of the time funny to see what fucked up thing she managed to do. But she'd never fucked with military accounts before. Not like this.{&1310}\par "Don't make that face at me, Ev. It's ugly."{&1310}\par I finally just sighed. There was nothing I could do about it now anyways.{&1310}\par "I'll be back in a few days. You want to wait up for me?"{&1310}\par "If I don't have anything better to do, I guess." She shrugged her shoulders at me. "It's not like your Dad will."{&1310}\par I let out another drawn-out sigh, and looked away. {&1310}\par No. He probably wouldn't.{&1310}\par "Hey," she said. "I'll wait for you. Alright?"{&1310}\par "Yeah ..."{&1310}\par I put the terminal back in standby when we were done talking.

I woke up after a few minutes of that. That, and the glowing blue light punching right through my eyelid into dreamless sleep.{&1310}\par "Dad! Something's happened. Please call me."{&1310}\par That was the message I'd left fifteen - no, almost sixteen - hours ago. Simple. Too short to cut off early. Too vague to just dismiss. At least, I had thought so.{&1310}\par I'd passed out sitting in front of the terminal a couple hours ago. Once I realized that beeping was an incoming transmission, I started stabbing drunkenly at the screen to accept it. I inflated and then quickly deflated again as soon as I saw who it was.{&1310}\par "Ugh. Don't get too excited to see me, Ev."{&1310}\par A holo of a woman from the shoulders up appeared in the air in front of me. I hadn't bothered to check the sender before accepting, but I'd have recognized that chirrupy sarcasm anywhere. Those bright green eyes stung in the dark of my bunkroom, and I winced back at her.{&1310}\par "Sorry, Tess." I still slumped, but tried harder not to let it show. "I'd hoped he would call back this time."{&1310}\par "Ol' Wier-do?" she shook her head, tossing that loose pink hair of hers around light-heartedly. "Don't you screen your calls?"{&1310}\par "No."{&1310}\par "You should, you know. All kinds of freaks and perverts might end up with your comm address ..."{&1310}\par I ran my hands back through my hair, throwing it out loose from the ponytail I kept for regulation. I wasn't awake enough yet to answer that kind of veiled threat in kind.{&1310}\par "Did you just wake up?" she chirped, reading my groggy thoughts.
