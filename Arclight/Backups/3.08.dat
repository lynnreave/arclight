I'm not sure how and I'm not sure why - but that thing didn't come back for us right away. Julian led us back down the stairs again, pistol free and tracking every shadow that moved. It had been fast. I thought - too fast for even him. But there was that paranoid, selfish hope that he might give us the chance to run again if it caught him first, and I couldn't rationalize that away from me in that moment.{&1310}\par Some of the people from downstairs had been alive when Tess and I took off. We found one of them still bleeding out, his face smeared in choked up blood and belly ripped wide open. There was nothing we could do for him, was all Julian had said. When he'd caught us staring. I didn't think there was anything I could have done for him, but his pain-stricken, terrified eyes followed us all the way out the front door - pleading. A part of me was too scared to care. A large part.{&1310}\par I didn't undestand why we made it out of there alive. Not until I heard the not-so-distant screaming in the town.{&1310}\par "Oh my god," Tess had gasped out when she heard them, staring off into the night. "W-what is ...?" She'd had one hand pointed out that way, turning a shock-frozen look of desperation back on Julian.{&1310}\par "We killed them," I'd breathed out loud beside her. I'm not sure where the thought came from, but it had weighed down so right on me of a sudden that I felt it crushing my guts. My hands had started trembling all on their own.{&1310}\par "I killed them."{&1310}\par "How did it find us?" Tess had whimpered right over me like she hadn't heard. She was still pleading with Julian. "How did it follow us all the way here?"{&1310}\par "Jules!" she'd snapped wildly at him when he didn't answer right away. He had been looking the other way and only gave the screams a passing glance.{&1310}\par "I don't know, but you'd better forget them if you want to stay alive."{&1310}\par That had thrown Tess for a second. Her face had frozen again in that distraught, horrified expression for a few seconds before she could open her mouth.

I'd broken in instead.{&1310}\par "We have to do is get back to that train."{&1310}\par She argued with him. Unbalanced and overwhelmed by everything going through her head, she yelled at him. I just stared off into the town for my part, ignoring them both until she grabbed at my arm.{&1310}\par "Right, Ev?" the other woman demanded of a sudden, her voice shaking.{&1310}\par I looked at her.

Slow, and then fast. I stared down at my feet - looked up, and an hour had passed. Landmarks had already faded behind. Then seconds would crawl by so slowly that I thought they'd choke the life out of me. The air felt thick, and heavy, and never stopped moving. It made it hard to catch a breath.{&1310}\par "Are you okay?" Tess tugged at my elbow somewhere along the bleak way of rocky hills sprouting up and leaving those less bumpy flatlands behind. I jerked at the touch without realizing it, forgetting again that she was even there and real. I managed to ask her as much while the nerve took me.{&1310}\par "I kinda followed you," she mumbled abashedly sometime later. We were trudgin beside that stony bluff Julian had said the train tunnel ran right through. So strange.{&1310}\par "I hid in one of the storage closets for two days. Just, uh ... don't ask me how I got to the toilet. You know Old Weir-do never sleeps."{&1310}\par "He never did."{&1310}\par Tess laughed it off, but I could tell her heart just wasn't in it either. I almost wished that I could even fake it like she did, but the thought still cut too deep.{&1310}\par She decided to tell me all about Julian to change the subject fast. She called him Jules, but I could tell he hated that. Eluvian - was what she said he was. I hadn't seen it, though I could see it in his profile and features now. Tall, and well-proportioned. Handsome in a timeless sort of way, even through the harshness and grime.{&1310}\par "I don't think they're supposed ta be carrying around guns, fighting monsters on some moon in the middle of nowhere, though," she mused aloud. "I think he was hunting pirates. Or something ..."{&1310}\par She'd always been into those things more than me, reading and watching everything she could get her hands on. And I guess it was hard for her to bury all that excitement in thinking about what had happened. She had wanted to get away from Riftwatch even more than me. It was probably why she had snuck along in the first place. Too bad Dad had ...{&1310}\par "Why is he here?" I asked her. Stuck there on that moon running for his life seemed like the last place anyone should have wanted to be. And he didn't know us at all.{&1310}\par "Here?" She blinked. "You mean - with us? Oh, he wouldn't be if he didn't have to," she whispered to me behind a hand, giving the Eluvian a furtive glance ahead where he was setting our breakneck marching pace. "I think. He tried to leave us behind a couple times anyways."{&1310}\par She didn't really explain that. But I had seen him take a swing at her back at the station, so I knew he wasn't all good. Still, I had seen him nearly get himself killed putting himself between us and that thing back on the train too.{&1310}\par "Do you know what that ... it was?" Tess eventually asked at some point. I had just tried to forget it since the whispering had stopped. Moved on, maybe. Either way, I shook my head.{&1310}\par "I saw something like it," I managed. And swallowed down the bile in my throat. "Back on the transport ship. Lots of them."{&1310}\par Tess' face blanched at that, and I gave her a sidelong look. {&1310}\par We slowed enough a little while later for her to catch up and ask Julian what it was, but his answer was even less heartening.{&1310}\par "No," he grunted back at her, keeping his rifle low and to the dirt as he moved. "But it didn't belong here."{&1310}\par "What the hell's that supposed to mean?"{&1310}\par He didn't answer her for a time, preoccupied with everything else around him. I listened in just the same when he did finally open his mouth again.{&1310}\par "I could just feel it," he continued in a low, absent voice. "Like a nail scratching on steel," he mused, almost uncharactistically of him - from what I had seen. Then he just repeated himself. {&1310}\par "It didn't belong here."\cf2\highlight0\f2 {&1310}\par }{&1310}
