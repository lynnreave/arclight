I liked reading in the dark. For some reason, it usually kept me awake. Not today, though.{&1310}\par "Another dream?" he asked aloud after a moment. The doubt was heavy in his voice. He probably thought I was just making up an excuse for actually falling asleep. It didn't really matter that it wasn't like I had just gone to sleep like a normal person. That might have been something, and really hard to do sitting in my chair. No, I knew. I must have been staring blankly at those screens until they went to sleep themselves, and blacked out.

"Just the same one with that man getting chased and finding the woman in the river."{&1310}\par "Brennan," he offered, and I nodded. "And her name?"{&1310}\par "Nope."{&1310}\par "Still seen through his eyes?"{&1310}\par "Like I was right there." I waved my free hand out irritably. "And inside his head." {&1310}\par The usual, thoughtful frown flashed across his face. That always troubled him the most, I knew. Something about dreaming someone else's thoughts entirely. I guess it would have unnerved me too, if I hadn't just tried to ignore it all.{&1310}\par He sighed.
