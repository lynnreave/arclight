Nothing took. That I could see, at least. When things settled down quickly after that without a sound, I looked at the Eluvian man in the dirt.{&1310}\par "Jules?"{&1310}\par I tried my quaky voice again. But he didn't bother to move on my account.{&1310}\par Oh god. {&1310}\par I'd killed him.{&1310}\par "... Jules!"{&1310}\par This time, it came out as barely more than a squeak.{&1310}\par He suddenly turned his head to one side, and spat out some blood into the dirt.{&1310}\par "Stop," he grunted, and growled, breathing hard, "calling me that."{&1310}\par I just stared at him, wide-eyed - suddenly wanting to laugh. But I couldn't. He started trying to pick himself up from the ground and crawl over my way. After an awkward moment, unsure what to do, I scrambled over to help.{&1310}\par "What the hell was \i that\i0 ?" I all but shrieked in his face when I got a hand on him. I forgot about it as soon as I got a good look at his face and the holes in him, though. It was tricky in the flickering light, but I could see the blood running down from his forehead, soaking his eyebrow, and the stained puncture in his jacket. "Are you all right?" I whispered frantically at him instead.{&1310}\par "I ... I don't know," he struggled with that, and I freaked out a bit more until I realized it was the answer to the first question. He pushed me away in response to the second, and hobbled over toward the fire. "Lucky you aren't any good with that," he mumbled under his breath.{&1310}\par Jules winced and plopped himself back down next to his pack, and I kept glancing back over toward the woods. No singe marks. I thought, frantically looking his beaten body over. Maybe I hadn't even hit him.{&1310}\par Small favors.{&1310}\par "We need to move," he said aloud at me, pulling something out of his things after wrestling, one-handed with it for a few seconds. It looked like one of those needles he had stuck Ev with the other night.{&1310}\par "What? How?" I babbled at him. "You can't even walk!"{&1310}\par He stabbed himself with that needle under his jacket near the hole that had been punched through it before I could do anything else. I gasped in surprise, but he got too busy convulsing violently. A couple seconds of that and then settled back down, stiff as a board.{&1310}\par "I'll be fine," he growled at me when he was done, his voice thin and strained.{&1310}\par "What about Ev!"{&1310}\par He was leaning back against the cliffside at a rigid angle, bloody face turned up and not seeing me as those hard eyes stared away into space. "I'll get her," he said simply. "Grab one of the," he twitched abruptly, wincing again, "logs from the fire."{&1310}\par "What? I'm not touching that!"{&1310}\par "Do it!" he hissed, eyes squeezing shut. He hefted his rifle awkwardly in one hand, the other pressed tight to the side of his chest with that hole. I don't know if he would have shot me for almost blowing his head off this time, but I dove toward the fire without thinking just the same, and dithered with one of those flaming pieces of wood a few seconds before I got a grip on it.{&1310}\par "Okay ..." I sat there with that flaming stick of wood in one hand, and my wide-eyed, terrified self in the other. "What do I do now?"{&1310}\par He chose that moment to come back to life, pulling himself back up and slowly climbing to his feet. {&1310}\par "Get behind me." {&1310}\par He stumbled over toward Ev, still comatose with her eyes open on the ground. That gave him a second's pause before he bent down to swing her up over one shoulder. {&1310}\par "Keep that ... sidearm ready," he grunted under the raven-haired woman's weight. She almost took him down, but he pushed right through it and had her up again. I just got in around behind him, shaking all over with the gun wobbling in hand. He canted his head.{&1310}\par "This way. Move."{&1310}\par \pard\fi720\sl480\slmult1 And we started off into that black wood. But I never stopped looking back.\cf2\highlight0\f2 {&1310}\par }{&1310}
