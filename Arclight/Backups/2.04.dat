I'd already twisted around before Tess could even finish.{&1310}\par We were sitting at Bertram's bar out front. After a lot of long-overdue snipes, jokes, and chiding remarks -- mostly Tess and Bertram going at it -- the old man finally calmed down enough to practically strangle me to death in a bearhug while saying how pale and half-starved I looked.

"Bless her heart for putting up with a fat, old man a little longer," he'd also added once she was out of earshot like always, "I'd probably have died if I'd seen the both of you go off all at once."{&1310}\par I followed Tess out front while Bertram promised to have something for us to eat as quick as he could. I found the other woman lounging at the bar, still smoking, and we hadn't been there three minutes when she finally said \i that\i0 .{&1310}\par At first I couldn't even tell what she was talking about. There were plenty of people scattered around the room for the afternoon crowd, coming and going, eating and drinking in the sometimes-bright-sometimes-dark, off-color mood lighting. Tess muttered something under her breath I couldn't make out, but it sounded frustrated. Then I figured it out. Some guy in a ruffled jacket over a tech coat was standing just inside the front doors, looking around. He found me and Tess at the bar and started forward in a rush.{&1310}\par "He's coming over here, isn't he?" Tess hissed across the not-so-clean counter at me, head hunched low.{&1310}\par "Yeah ..." I told her, coming back around.{&1310}\par "Fuck!"{&1310}\par "Who the hell is he?"{&1310}\par "Ughhhh ..." she just growled disgust in her throat. And before she could think to actually answer me, that guy was suddenly looming over her other shoulder.{&1310}\par "You haven't called me," he blurted out almost immediately, before she even got the chance to acknowledge him. Like they knew each other pretty well. Which was funny because I was pretty damn sure Tess would have said something if she'd met anyone like that. It should have been the \i first\i0  thing out of her mouth after I got off the transport.{&1310}\par Tess tilted her head back, puffing out exaggeratedly as she looked up at the ceiling and sighed.{&1310}\par "I've been busy."{&1310}\par "For three weeks," was the flat, rhetorical question out of his mouth. But she answered it anyways.{&1310}\par "Uh -- \i yeah\i0 ."{&1310}\par "Doing what?"{&1310}\par "None of your fucking business, that's what."{&1310}\par There was a pause as he seemed to gauge her and I got a better look at him without being too obvious. Tall, thin, dark-trimmed hair and sallow cheeks, that jacket he was hiding -- definitely a lab rat on the station. His collar beneath the civvie coat said naval lieutenant commander in rank, and he looked in his thirties -- maybe a ten years older than Tess. He had a practiced sort of calm on the surface but there was ... \i something\i0  ... I don't know -- \i off\i0 .{&1310}\par "I left you plenty of messages," he continued, and Tess waved a hand.{&1310}\par "Yeah, well, I must've missed 'em."{&1310}\par He snatched her arm in midair and twisted it over, exposing her comm unit beneath the sleeve. "No, you didn't. You've been deliberately ignoring me."{&1310}\par "Hey, what the fuck!" she yanked her hand back.{&1310}\par "Theresa-" he started.{&1310}\par "Don't freaking call me that!"{&1310}\par "I don't think you understand how important this is -- I," he glanced around quickly -- still not noticing me there at all, I guess -- and then ducked in closer like he had some big secret, "... I told you all about the implications. It ... I mean, it'll be revolutionary! You understand that right?" He was pushing in close to whisper excitedly at her, and didn't seem to notice her pulling herself even further back away from him. "Please, you \i have\i0  to come see my latest work in the lab. I need someone to--," he caught himself, and then continued, "I need \i you\i0  to be there this time."{&1310}\par He was excited, bristling all over with that energized, all-consuming look that his type sometimes got whenever they'd do something new and were so full of themselves and what they did that they simply \i had\i0  to tell everyone. Or at least someone. In this case, I guess -- Tess.{&1310}\par She just gave him a shifty look.{&1310}\par "Uh, well -- I mean, I would, but ..." And she abruptly snatched me up by the arm, pulling me halfway right out of my seat.{&1310}\par "\i Hey\i0 -"{&1310}\par "But my best friend just got back from basic training and I, um ... promised to hang out with her for the next two weeks. So I'll be \i way\i0  too busy for a while.{&1310}\par "Uh, hi," I managed, but Tess still wouldn't let me go. {&1310}\par I cleared my throat and still, she hung on.{&1310}\par "Two weeks," the guy started to say, not even really caring that I was there. Not that that bothered me at all since I was pretty sure I didn't want to meet him anyways. But then he did look at me, while I was trying to pull myself free of Tess weirdly vicious deathgrip. He saw the motion and followed her hand to my arm up to my face and stopped in midsentence, and stared. All that nervous energy went right out of him and he was suddenly still.{&1310}\par Tess had her mouth open like she was already getting ready to say something back, but didn't. She noticed him and then slowly looked from that guy to me with a slow turn of her pink head. Her eyes bounced back and forth in a "what the fuck?" sort of way a few times before she finally did something, the whole while with me sitting there suddenly being eyeballed by her creepy-as-fuck wannabe boyfriend.{&1310}\par "Brant-?"{&1310}\par "Excuse me." His words practically jumped on top of hers in a rush to get out of his mouth. Then he was gone. Just ... gone. Just - a hasty, awkward scramble to climb over himself back toward the exit. We both watched him go.{&1310}\par "Woah," was all Tess could say about that for a few seconds. I glanced around the bar once he was gone to see if anyone else had noticed how fucking weird that way. I guess I was the only one, though. And Tess too.{&1310}\par "I can't figure out if he likes you," Tess finally continued, still staring, "or hates you."{&1310}\par "What is \i that\i0  supposed to mean?"{&1310}\par She ignored me, just shaking her head. Eventually she shrugged. "Either way, I guess he won't be bugging me as much if I keep you around. Oh \i god\i0 ," she abruptly slumped on her stool, "you'll be gone again \i way\i0  too soon."{&1310}\par  Before I could even get irritated at the fact that she was more worried about that guy harassing her than me \i leaving\i0  again, she had already pulled another cigarette and started to light up.{&1310}\par "Who the hell even \i was\i0  that guy?" I asked instead.{&1310}\par "I don't know," she shook her head, "or care." She breathed out smoke. "Not seeing me or anything, if that's what you think."{&1310}\par "I hope not."{&1310}\par "No fucking way. He just came in here some night a while ago and started hitting on me. I think I told you about him in one of those messages I sent you."{&1310}\par I remembered now. {&1310}\par "Yeah, I think so."{&1310}\par "He, uh, well I found out he was working in one of the more 'restricted' areas," she crooked her fingers in the air as she said it, "and I, well, I thought I'd get a closer look since he offered ..."{&1310}\par I almost burst out laughing, but I caught myself before the whole room heard it. Tess had a way too innocent look on her face as she said it not to laugh. "Anything interesting?" I managed to ask.{&1310}\par "Not really," she sighed, and deflated. Then she turned and tapped out ash from her cigarette on Bertram's side of the bar while he wasn't there and looking. "Not enough to put up with him creepin' on me all the time now. Fucking weirdo."{&1310}\par The kitchen doors flashed open and Tess' hand instantly withdrew from across the bar like it'd never been there. Too bad the first thing Bertram noticed as he came out with two steaming plates of what was supposed to look like beef, potatoes, and corn -- but was really just gussied up nutrient rations -- was that ash on the deck as he stepped in it.{&1310}\par "What the-"{&1310}\par He jumped back, looking sharply at his shoes. Then he stuck a fat finger in Tess' face. His own scrunched up into a craggy, pudgy mass. "I'm gonna leave that for your shift tonight!"{&1310}\par "Whaaat."{&1310}\par "Yeah, that's right, girl. Done more than my fair share of cleaning up after you. This one can wait. Just for \i you\i0 ."{&1310}\par "You mean I have to come in to\i night\i0 ? It's Ev's first day back!"{&1310}\par "I don't care if it's her fucking \i birthday\i0  you ..."{&1310}\par {&1310}\par \pard\sl480\slmult1\qc *\tab *\tab *{&1310}\par \pard\fi720\sl480\slmult1 "Tess ..." I mumbled to myself in the dark. "Dad? Bertram ... where are you?"{&1310}\par I was moving down the hallway toward where that scream had come from and I stumbled, pitching forward. A sharp pain lanced through my head like someone had just burned a hole between the backs of my eyes and-{&1310}\par "GET OUT!"{&1310}\par My face was squished up against the floor, some voice ringing in my ears. There was anger, flaring up and burning all the fear to ash. It drowned me inside it.{&1310}\par I worked to curl up into a little ball there against the deck -- to disappear intot he metal and vanish forever. I tried to cry out but nothing would come from my mouth. My eyes watered until I couldn't see and then I squeezed them shut.{&1310}\par Then, just as quickly as that pain had started -- it stopped.{&1310}\par I was lying on the floor, tears in my eyes, and struggling tob reathe.{&1310}\par What ...{&1310}\par ... the ...{&1310}\par I couldn't even finish the thought. It felt like someone had punched me right in the stomach and knocked the wind out of me except replace stomach with brain and wind with ... I didn't even know. Sanity? Consciousness? Probably that, since I lost time there, curled up int he dark. It was dizzying and enervating and for too long I couldn't even move -- didn't \i want\i0  to move.{&1310}\par If some pirate had come up and shot me right then and there I probably wouldn't have cared. I felt sick to my ... \i everything\i0 .{&1310}\par It passed, though. Eventually, it passed.{&1310}\par I half threw up as I tried to pick myself back up from the deck. Drool was leaking out of the side of my mouth back down to the floor. I had to blink exasperatedly to clear my eyes and even that didn't do it so I tried scrubbign at them with an unresponsive hand. I ended up toppling over to one side.{&1310}\par \i You're going to die. The station is under attack and you're going to die. Get up or you're going to die here\i0 -{&1310}\par It must have taken me five whole minutes to slowly pick myself back up again. All the while I started to remember that scream and how close it had probably been. And how it had cut off.{&1310}\par I hobbled along a few steps forward. I had to catch my balance against the bulkhead. There were more labs here, branching off to either side and swimming in view as my brain felt like it was still trying to flop around inside my head. It took me a little while and another  meter or so of stumbling over myself to realize how much more wrecked these labs were than the ones in the next deck. Equipment was scattered all over the place like someone had raged out in one. I staggered to the other side of the corridor and noticed the shattered glass and blood in another. No body, though. I didn't find the first body until after I'd felt my hand scrape against the plasma scoring on the wall.{&1310}\par More than one. I came up short in the next corridor and found at least half a dozen littered around the deck. Marines. \i Dead\i0  marines. They looked like they'd died defending the station.{&1310}\par I felt sick, seeing those bodies there. I could easily remember what this place looked like without them, and that had just been today. Yesterday? My head hurt and it was hard to tell. I had to fight the instinct to dry heave again as I dropped down to get a better look at the closest one.{&1310}\par He was heavy in full body armor and what must have a lot of augments. A corporal. I managed to turn him over and found his gun where he'd collapsed down face-first on top of it. I checked the rifle but it was even deader than that officer's pistol.{&1310}\par "What the \i fuck \i0 ..."{&1310}\par It was \i hard \i0 not to sound hopeless and lost. There was no reason why a fully-loaded marine would have a dead weapon. \i No\i0  reason. No fucking reason at all!{&1310}\par Then I noticed how cut up he was.{&1310}\par Freshly coagulating blood was leaking slowly onto the deck. I stared at it for a second with one hand holding his oversized bulk back from where his gun had lay, frowning. Then his LBV ripped just a bit more, armor cracked, and his whole body fell apart.{&1310}\par I fell over myself scrambling back away. That wet squelching noise ehcoed in the dim corridor, but all I could see was the silhouette of that fleshy viscera that had fallen out whent he dead marine disintegrated. My brain stopped working for a few seconds while it tried to process what it was looking at right in front of it.{&1310}\par Then, "what the fuck kind of weapon could do that?" was the only thought in my head for a long time. There weren't any holes like a firebolt would have left -- molten plasma punched right through stinking flesh. I couldn't even bring myself to tauch the armor and look for small arms scoring. It didn't matter. A knife? He'd been \i gutted\i0  right through his armor so fast and so badly that it was only the pieces keeping \i his\i0  pieces together. What kind of knife could do that? And who the hell would stab him that many times to kill him?{&1310}\par \i Fuck\i0 !{&1310}\par I found myself backed up against the wall again without realizing it. I was too numb and light-headed to puke, so I just got back up and teetered there. The rest of the bodies seemed just as bad off from a distance, but I couldn't think about it. I stumbled around and checked them for live weapons in a haze. {&1310}\par I did manage to find one that was only \i mostly\i0  depleted and I couldn't help wondering what the hell kind of good it would even do if a squad of marines with a hell of a lot more real combat experience than some fucking loser cadet couldn't survive whatever it was that had happened. An entire squad!{&1310}\par This deck was no better than the last one. \i Worse\i0 , really -- assuming mutilated bodies was worse than no bodies left at all. Was it? I didn't know what else I could possibly do, though. The maintenance tubes were locked down -- there was probably vacuum between me and everything else for all I fucking knew -- the power was out, the fucking lifts were fucking useless so I was trapped in here with whatever had killed those marines and-{&1310}\par I stopped again, and slumped back against one wall, mostly-dead pulse rifle in one hand and growled aloud in a helpless whisper, "What the fuck am I supposed to do!" It was hard not to collapse back down again. I guess keep going? Until I ran out of air. Or found someone who wasn't dead. Or found whatever it was that killed these marines.{&1310}\par A scream again. It echoed so loudly and suddenly that I jumped into the wall and nearly fell over one of the bodies. "Fuck you!" I hissed at it. My hands got the rifle back up way too late to do anything but hate myself for it. To bad there wasn't a fucking drill instructor around to scream at me for being fucking useless!{&1310}\par I swallowed. Hard. Then I tried to listen.{&1310}\par Nothing. {&1310}\par No ... movement. {&1310}\par Maybe?{&1310}\par Those creepy structural sounds you heard in vids when there was some freaky Tau monster around the corner, deeper in the abandoned colony or mining station or something. If you'd only seen vids you'd wonder why that whole system didn't just fall apart with all the genetic mutations and secret monstrosities and DNA resequencing gone wrong that'd then be unleashed on some terrified fictional people. But ... I'd never seen anything but vids. I only knew that they did do a lot of genetic research and the Navy knew firsthand how well they could weaponize it. They always said stuff like the pirates were secretly funded by Tau military sects. And if anyone was going to lose a real, live monster on anyone -- it was Tau.{&1310}\par No, no, no -- I didn't like where that thought was going.{&1310}\par I readjusted the pulse rifle in my hands. It felt good there. Of course it did. After six months of never being far away from my training issue one, I hadn't even realized how naked I'd felt stepping onto the station. At least this one was live. I needed it. I really fucking did.{&1310}\par As much as I would've rather just stayed there, the better half of my brain kept reminding me how stupid that was. It was also the half that thought keeping whatever it was that had butchered those marines ahead of me was better than not knowing where it was at all.  That didn't mean I was going to chase it, though. I'd seen just how good a squad of trained grunts could do so I was pretty damn sure I had no chance by myself. {&1310}\par Stepping quietly and carefully down the corridor gave me something to focus on other than how close that scream had sounded. My shoes squelched fresh gore on the deck and I felt stale bile in my throat. I was sweating, and I was cold. Every muscle was pulled so tight I was sure it would snap. But somehow I reached the next bend with only my rattled breathing in the dark for company. No more screams.{&1310}\par I had to keep going.{&1310}\par I peeked around, holding what little I could of my breath. I had a deathgrip on the rifle in my hands. The scream, I was pretty sure, had come from around there.{&1310}\par Another corridor opened up beyond. This one had more labs marching along to either side of it -- biotics a half-dead, glimmering sign said. I was still in the research towers, and I had no idea how far up or down. The habitats were where I needed to go.{&1310}\par Bodies. On the floor. More of them.{&1310}\par I could just make out the silhouetted corpses, squinting. It took me a few seconds to realize that they even \i were\i0  bodies. Bits and pieces were scattered everywhere. On the walls. The ceiling. I could see splattered chunks blotting out the emergency lights. If I hadn't stumbled across those dead marines, I would have wondered what they were. But no. I knew.{&1310}\par I might have thrown up again then -- as that sickly, sweet smell washed over me like it had just been waiting for someone to stumble on by -- except something moved in the dark. I froze as something whispered at me from the shadows cast by those diced up corpses. A sound like ripping flesh and crackling bone. Like everything horrible that had ever come up out of my nightmares ont he cusp of waking that I could never remember. That I would never \i let\i0  myself remember. It murmured out of the black, and I froze.{&1310}\par I don't know how long I stood there, one hand and one eye creeping around the corner of the bulkhead and staring into nothing while that something kept on without noticing. Too scared to move. Too scared to make a sound. Too scared to \i think\i0 .{&1310}\par My feet wanted to pull back away from that next corridor, but I wouldn't let them. I wasn't going to let it know I was there. I'd wait until I breathed up all the air left and died first. And then I'd make sure I hit the ground so softly it never knew I'd ever been alive.{&1310}\par Something sparked on the wall, and the corridor lit up in a brief, desperate flash as I stared.{&1310}\par I would have thrown up then, but something was moving at the end of the hall.{&1310}\par I only caught a glimpse. There was a bloody, wailing mass of a girl on the ground ahead through the door at the end. Something lumbered over to her, and it made a sound as it scraped her up off the ground. A sound like ripping flesh and crackling bone. Like everything horrible that had ever come out my nightmares on the cusp of waking that I could never remember. That I would never let myself remember. I only caught a glimpse, and that was all I ever needed. {&1310}\par I did throw up then. I puked into a bloody, helpless hand. {&1310}\par Somehow, my back was against the wall again, and I was out of sight. I felt like my lungs had seized up, both legs stiff and stuck at awkward angles to the floor. My knees shook, and I just sat there, unable to move. Everything was ice, chills creeping up like tiny talons along my spine. Another second like that - and all the lights flickered out.{&1310}\par I might have cried again there in the dark. I know I laughed. An insane, helpless laugh. But in the end, I just squeezed my eyes shut.{&1310}\par Every dream came screaming back from where I had buried it, howling and clawing right through my brain. Every hook, claw, and talon. Every severed head, punctured gut, and limb torn free. Every ounce of blood splattered everywhere. Everything that I had kept hidden and locked away from the waking world and Dr. Sweeney's probing interrogations. It all flashed in my head in an instant. But it wasn't real. It wasn't ... \i real\i0 .{&1310}\par "It's not real."{&1310}\par I took a deep, shuddering breath. Somehow. And opened my eyes again, slowly. Emergency lights had come on, painting the passage with specks of dim red. They didn't do much at all. But it was enough, for a moment just then, not to be lost in the dark down there.{&1310}\par When I came back, though, something very real loomed right next to my head.\cf2\f1 {&1310}\par }{&1310}

Her eyes bounced back and forth in a "what the fuck?" sort of way a few times before she finally did something, the whole while with me sitting there suddenly being eyeballed by her creepy-as-fuck wannabe boyfriend.{&1310}\par "Brant-?"{&1310}\par "Excuse me." His words practically jumped on top of hers in a rush to get out of his mouth. Then he was gone. Just ... gone. Just - a hasty, awkward scramble to climb over himself back toward the exit. We both watched him go.{&1310}\par "Woah," was all Tess could say about that for a few seconds. I glanced around the bar once he was gone to see if anyone else had noticed how fucking weird that way. I guess I was the only one, though. And Tess too.{&1310}\par "I can't figure out if he likes you," Tess finally continued, still staring, "or hates you."{&1310}\par "What is \i that\i0  supposed to mean?"{&1310}\par She ignored me, just shaking her head. Eventually she shrugged. "Either way, I guess he won't be bugging me as much if I keep you around. Oh \i god\i0 ," she abruptly slumped on her stool, "you'll be gone again \i way\i0  too soon."{&1310}\par  Before I could even get irritated at the fact that she was more worried about that guy harassing her than me \i leaving\i0  again, she had already pulled another cigarette and started to light up.{&1310}\par "Who the hell even \i was\i0  that guy?" I asked instead.{&1310}\par "I don't know," she shook her head, "or care." She breathed out smoke. "Not seeing me or anything, if that's what you think."{&1310}\par "I hope not."{&1310}\par "No fucking way. He just came in here some night a while ago and started hitting on me. I think I told you about him in one of those messages I sent you."{&1310}\par I remembered now. {&1310}\par "Yeah, I think so."{&1310}\par "He, uh, well I found out he was working in one of the more 'restricted' areas," she crooked her fingers in the air as she said it, "and I, well, I thought I'd get a closer look since he offered ..."{&1310}\par I almost burst out laughing, but I caught myself before the whole room heard it. Tess had a way too innocent look on her face as she said it not to laugh. "Anything interesting?" I managed to ask.{&1310}\par "Not really," she sighed, and deflated. Then she turned and tapped out ash from her cigarette on Bertram's side of the bar while he wasn't there and looking. "Not enough to put up with him creepin' on me all the time now. Fucking weirdo."{&1310}\par The kitchen doors flashed open and Tess' hand instantly withdrew from across the bar like it'd never been there. Too bad the first thing Bertram noticed as he came out with two steaming plates of what was supposed to look like beef, potatoes, and corn -- but was really just gussied up nutrient rations -- was that ash on the deck as he stepped in it.{&1310}\par "What the-"{&1310}\par He jumped back, looking sharply at his shoes. Then he stuck a fat finger in Tess' face. His own scrunched up into a craggy, pudgy mass. "I'm gonna leave that for your shift tonight!"{&1310}\par "Whaaat."{&1310}\par "Yeah, that's right, girl. Done more than my fair share of cleaning up after you. This one can wait. Just for \i you\i0 ."{&1310}\par "You mean I have to come in to\i night\i0 ? It's Ev's first day back!"{&1310}\par "I don't care if it's her fucking \i birthday\i0  you ..."{&1310}\par {&1310}\par \pard\sl480\slmult1\qc *\tab *\tab *{&1310}\par \pard\fi720\sl480\slmult1 "Tess ..." I mumbled to myself in the dark. "Dad? Bertram ... where are you?"{&1310}\par I was moving down the hallway toward where that scream had come from and I stumbled, pitching forward. A sharp pain lanced through my head like someone had just burned a hole between the backs of my eyes and-{&1310}\par "GET OUT!"{&1310}\par My face was squished up against the floor, some voice ringing in my ears. There was anger, flaring up and burning all the fear to ash. It drowned me inside it.{&1310}\par I worked to curl up into a little ball there against the deck -- to disappear intot he metal and vanish forever. I tried to cry out but nothing would come from my mouth. My eyes watered until I couldn't see and then I squeezed them shut.{&1310}\par Then, just as quickly as that pain had started -- it stopped.{&1310}\par I was lying on the floor, tears in my eyes, and struggling tob reathe.{&1310}\par What ...{&1310}\par ... the ...{&1310}\par I couldn't even finish the thought. It felt like someone had punched me right in the stomach and knocked the wind out of me except replace stomach with brain and wind with ... I didn't even know. Sanity? Consciousness? Probably that, since I lost time there, curled up int he dark. It was dizzying and enervating and for too long I couldn't even move -- didn't \i want\i0  to move.{&1310}\par If some pirate had come up and shot me right then and there I probably wouldn't have cared. I felt sick to my ... \i everything\i0 .{&1310}\par It passed, though. Eventually, it passed.{&1310}\par I half threw up as I tried to pick myself back up from the deck. Drool was leaking out of the side of my mouth back down to the floor. I had to blink exasperatedly to clear my eyes and even that didn't do it so I tried scrubbign at them with an unresponsive hand. I ended up toppling over to one side.{&1310}\par \i You're going to die. The station is under attack and you're going to die. Get up or you're going to die here\i0 -{&1310}\par It must have taken me five whole minutes to slowly pick myself back up again. All the while I started to remember that scream and how close it had probably been. And how it had cut off.{&1310}\par I hobbled along a few steps forward. I had to catch my balance against the bulkhead. There were more labs here, branching off to either side and swimming in view as my brain felt like it was still trying to flop around inside my head. It took me a little while and another  meter or so of stumbling over myself to realize how much more wrecked these labs were than the ones in the next deck. Equipment was scattered all over the place like someone had raged out in one. I staggered to the other side of the corridor and noticed the shattered glass and blood in another. No body, though. I didn't find the first body until after I'd felt my hand scrape against the plasma scoring on the wall.{&1310}\par More than one. I came up short in the next corridor and found at least half a dozen littered around the deck. Marines. \i Dead\i0  marines. They looked like they'd died defending the station.{&1310}\par I felt sick, seeing those bodies there. I could easily remember what this place looked like without them, and that had just been today. Yesterday? My head hurt and it was hard to tell. I had to fight the instinct to dry heave again as I dropped down to get a better look at the closest one.{&1310}\par He was heavy in full body armor and what must have a lot of augments. A corporal. I managed to turn him over and found his gun where he'd collapsed down face-first on top of it. I checked the rifle but it was even deader than that officer's pistol.{&1310}\par "What the \i fuck \i0 ..."{&1310}\par It was \i hard \i0 not to sound hopeless and lost. There was no reason why a fully-loaded marine would have a dead weapon. \i No\i0  reason. No fucking reason at all!{&1310}\par Then I noticed how cut up he was.{&1310}\par Freshly coagulating blood was leaking slowly onto the deck. I stared at it for a second with one hand holding his oversized bulk back from where his gun had lay, frowning. Then his LBV ripped just a bit more, armor cracked, and his whole body fell apart.{&1310}\par I fell over myself scrambling back away. That wet squelching noise ehcoed in the dim corridor, but all I could see was the silhouette of that fleshy viscera that had fallen out whent he dead marine disintegrated. My brain stopped working for a few seconds while it tried to process what it was looking at right in front of it.{&1310}\par Then, "what the fuck kind of weapon could do that?" was the only thought in my head for a long time. There weren't any holes like a firebolt would have left -- molten plasma punched right through stinking flesh. I couldn't even bring myself to tauch the armor and look for small arms scoring. It didn't matter. A knife? He'd been \i gutted\i0  right through his armor so fast and so badly that it was only the pieces keeping \i his\i0  pieces together. What kind of knife could do that? And who the hell would stab him that many times to kill him?{&1310}\par \i Fuck\i0 !{&1310}\par I found myself backed up against the wall again without realizing it. I was too numb and light-headed to puke, so I just got back up and teetered there. The rest of the bodies seemed just as bad off from a distance, but I couldn't think about it. I stumbled around and checked them for live weapons in a haze. {&1310}\par I did manage to find one that was only \i mostly\i0  depleted and I couldn't help wondering what the hell kind of good it would even do if a squad of marines with a hell of a lot more real combat experience than some fucking loser cadet couldn't survive whatever it was that had happened. An entire squad!{&1310}\par This deck was no better than the last one. \i Worse\i0 , really -- assuming mutilated bodies was worse than no bodies left at all. Was it? I didn't know what else I could possibly do, though. The maintenance tubes were locked down -- there was probably vacuum between me and everything else for all I fucking knew -- the power was out, the fucking lifts were fucking useless so I was trapped in here with whatever had killed those marines and-{&1310}\par I stopped again, and slumped back against one wall, mostly-dead pulse rifle in one hand and growled aloud in a helpless whisper, "What the fuck am I supposed to do!" It was hard not to collapse back down again. I guess keep going? Until I ran out of air. Or found someone who wasn't dead. Or found whatever it was that killed these marines.{&1310}\par A scream again. It echoed so loudly and suddenly that I jumped into the wall and nearly fell over one of the bodies. "Fuck you!" I hissed at it. My hands got the rifle back up way too late to do anything but hate myself for it. To bad there wasn't a fucking drill instructor around to scream at me for being fucking useless!{&1310}\par I swallowed. Hard. Then I tried to listen.{&1310}\par Nothing. {&1310}\par No ... movement. {&1310}\par Maybe?{&1310}\par Those creepy structural sounds you heard in vids when there was some freaky Tau monster around the corner, deeper in the abandoned colony or mining station or something. If you'd only seen vids you'd wonder why that whole system didn't just fall apart with all the genetic mutations and secret monstrosities and DNA resequencing gone wrong that'd then be unleashed on some terrified fictional people. But ... I'd never seen anything but vids. I only knew that they did do a lot of genetic research and the Navy knew firsthand how well they could weaponize it. They always said stuff like the pirates were secretly funded by Tau military sects. And if anyone was going to lose a real, live monster on anyone -- it was Tau.{&1310}\par No, no, no -- I didn't like where that thought was going.\cf2\f1 {&1310}\par }{&1310}

I'd already twisted around before Tess could even finish.{&1310}\par We were sitting at Bertram's bar out front. After a lot of long-overdue snipes, jokes, and chiding remarks -- mostly Tess and Bertram going at it -- the old man finally calmed down enough to practically strangle me to death in a bearhug while saying how pale and half-starved I looked. Once the excitement started to wear down, it was hard to get him to let me go until Tess interjected something about me being the favorite even though he hadn't adopted \i me\i0 .{&1310}\par "To hell with ya I would have if I'd know how much damned troubled you'd be, girl!" he'd snapped at her and she laughed before getting chased out of the kitchen. "Bless her heart for putting up with a fat, old man a little longer," he'd also added once she was out of earshot like always, "I'd probably have died if I'd seen the both of you go off all at once."{&1310}\par I followed Tess out front while Bertram promised to have something for us to eat as quick as he could. I found the other woman lounging at the bar, still smoking, and we hadn't been there three minutes when she finally said \i that\i0 .{&1310}\par At first I couldn't even tell what she was talking about. There were plenty of people scattered around the room for the afternoon crowd, coming and going, eating and drinking in the sometimes-bright-sometimes-dark, off-color mood lighting. Tess muttered something under her breath I couldn't make out, but it sounded frustrated. Then I figured it out. Some guy in a ruffled jacket over a tech coat was standing just inside the front doors, looking around. He found me and Tess at the bar and started forward in a rush.{&1310}\par "He's coming over here, isn't he?" Tess hissed across the not-so-clean counter at me, head hunched low.{&1310}\par "Yeah ..." I told her, coming back around.{&1310}\par "Fuck!"{&1310}\par "Who the hell is he?"{&1310}\par "Ughhhh ..." she just growled disgust in her throat. And before she could think to actually answer me, that guy was suddenly looming over her other shoulder.{&1310}\par "You haven't called me," he blurted out almost immediately, before she even got the chance to acknowledge him. Like they knew each other pretty well. Which was funny because I was pretty damn sure Tess would have said something if she'd met anyone like that. It should have been the \i first\i0  thing out of her mouth after I got off the transport.{&1310}\par Tess tilted her head back, puffing out exaggeratedly as she looked up at the ceiling and sighed.{&1310}\par "I've been busy."{&1310}\par "For three weeks," was the flat, rhetorical question out of his mouth. But she answered it anyways.{&1310}\par "Uh -- \i yeah\i0 ."{&1310}\par "Doing what?"{&1310}\par "None of your fucking business, that's what."{&1310}\par There was a pause as he seemed to gauge her and I got a better look at him without being too obvious. Tall, thin, dark-trimmed hair and sallow cheeks, that jacket he was hiding -- definitely a lab rat on the station. His collar beneath the civvie coat said naval lieutenant commander in rank, and he looked in his thirties -- maybe a ten years older than Tess. He had a practiced sort of calm on the surface but there was ... \i something\i0  ... I don't know -- \i off\i0 .{&1310}\par "I left you plenty of messages," he continued, and Tess waved a hand.{&1310}\par "Yeah, well, I must've missed 'em."{&1310}\par He snatched her arm in midair and twisted it over, exposing her comm unit beneath the sleeve. "No, you didn't. You've been deliberately ignoring me."{&1310}\par "Hey, what the fuck!" she yanked her hand back.{&1310}\par "Theresa-" he started.{&1310}\par "Don't freaking call me that!"{&1310}\par "I don't think you understand how important this is -- I," he glanced around quickly -- still not noticing me there at all, I guess -- and then ducked in closer like he had some big secret, "... I told you all about the implications. It ... I mean, it'll be revolutionary! You understand that right?" He was pushing in close to whisper excitedly at her, and didn't seem to notice her pulling herself even further back away from him. "Please, you \i have\i0  to come see my latest work in the lab. I need someone to--," he caught himself, and then continued, "I need \i you\i0  to be there this time."{&1310}\par He was excited, bristling all over with that energized, all-consuming look that his type sometimes got whenever they'd do something new and were so full of themselves and what they did that they simply \i had\i0  to tell everyone. Or at least someone. In this case, I guess -- Tess.{&1310}\par She just gave him a shifty look.{&1310}\par "Uh, well -- I mean, I would, but ..." And she abruptly snatched me up by the arm, pulling me halfway right out of my seat.{&1310}\par "\i Hey\i0 -"{&1310}\par "But my best friend just got back from basic training and I, um ... promised to hang out with her for the next two weeks. So I'll be \i way\i0  too busy for a while.{&1310}\par "Uh, hi," I managed, but Tess still wouldn't let me go. {&1310}\par I cleared my throat and still, she hung on.{&1310}\par "Two weeks," the guy started to say, not even really caring that I was there. Not that that bothered me at all since I was pretty sure I didn't want to meet him anyways. But then he did look at me, while I was trying to pull myself free of Tess weirdly vicious deathgrip. He saw the motion and followed her hand to my arm up to my face and stopped in midsentence, and stared. All that nervous energy went right out of him and he was suddenly still.{&1310}\par Tess had her mouth open like she was already getting ready to say something back, but didn't. She noticed him and then slowly looked from that guy to me with a slow turn of her pink head. Her eyes bounced back and forth in a "what the fuck?" sort of way a few times before she finally did something, the whole while with me sitting there suddenly being eyeballed by her creepy-as-fuck wannabe boyfriend.{&1310}\par "Brant-?"{&1310}\par "Excuse me." His words practically jumped on top of hers in a rush to get out of his mouth. Then he was gone. Just ... gone. Just - a hasty, awkward scramble to climb over himself back toward the exit. We both watched him go.{&1310}\par "Woah," was all Tess could say about that for a few seconds. I glanced around the bar once he was gone to see if anyone else had noticed how fucking weird that way. I guess I was the only one, though. And Tess too.{&1310}\par "I can't figure out if he likes you," Tess finally continued, still staring, "or hates you."{&1310}\par "What is \i that\i0  supposed to mean?"{&1310}\par She ignored me, just shaking her head. Eventually she shrugged. "Either way, I guess he won't be bugging me as much if I keep you around. Oh \i god\i0 ," she abruptly slumped on her stool, "you'll be gone again \i way\i0  too soon."{&1310}\par  Before I could even get irritated at the fact that she was more worried about that guy harassing her than me \i leaving\i0  again, she had already pulled another cigarette and started to light up.{&1310}\par "Who the hell even \i was\i0  that guy?" I asked instead.{&1310}\par "I don't know," she shook her head, "or care." She breathed out smoke. "Not seeing me or anything, if that's what you think."{&1310}\par "I hope not."{&1310}\par "No fucking way. He just came in here some night a while ago and started hitting on me. I think I told you about him in one of those messages I sent you."{&1310}\par I remembered now. {&1310}\par "Yeah, I think so."{&1310}\par "He, uh, well I found out he was working in one of the more 'restricted' areas," she crooked her fingers in the air as she said it, "and I, well, I thought I'd get a closer look since he offered ..."{&1310}\par I almost burst out laughing, but I caught myself before the whole room heard it. Tess had a way too innocent look on her face as she said it not to laugh. "Anything interesting?" I managed to ask.{&1310}\par "Not really," she sighed, and deflated. Then she turned and tapped out ash from her cigarette on Bertram's side of the bar while he wasn't there and looking. "Not enough to put up with him creepin' on me all the time now. Fucking weirdo."{&1310}\par The kitchen doors flashed open and Tess' hand instantly withdrew from across the bar like it'd never been there. Too bad the first thing Bertram noticed as he came out with two steaming plates of what was supposed to look like beef, potatoes, and corn -- but was really just gussied up nutrient rations -- was that ash on the deck as he stepped in it.{&1310}\par "What the-"{&1310}\par He jumped back, looking sharply at his shoes. Then he stuck a fat finger in Tess' face. His own scrunched up into a craggy, pudgy mass. "I'm gonna leave that for your shift tonight!"{&1310}\par "Whaaat."{&1310}\par "Yeah, that's right, girl. Done more than my fair share of cleaning up after you. This one can wait. Just for \i you\i0 ."{&1310}\par "You mean I have to come in to\i night\i0 ?

I mumbled to myself in the dark. "Dad? Bertram ... where are you?"{&1310}\par I was moving down the hallway toward where that scream had come from and I stumbled, pitching forward. A sharp pain lanced through my head like someone had just burned a hole between the backs of my eyes and-{&1310}\par "GET OUT!"{&1310}\par My face was squished up against the floor, some voice ringing in my ears. There was anger, flaring up and burning all the fear to ash. It drowned me inside it.{&1310}\par I worked to curl up into a little ball there against the deck -- to disappear intot he metal and vanish forever. I tried to cry out but nothing would come from my mouth. My eyes watered until I couldn't see and then I squeezed them shut.{&1310}\par Then, just as quickly as that pain had started -- it stopped.{&1310}\par I was lying on the floor, tears in my eyes, and struggling tob reathe.{&1310}\par What ...{&1310}\par ... the ...{&1310}\par I couldn't even finish the thought. It felt like someone had punched me right in the stomach and knocked the wind out of me except replace stomach with brain and wind with ... I didn't even know. Sanity? Consciousness?

It was dizzying and enervating and for too long I couldn't even move -- didn't \i want\i0  to move.{&1310}\par If some pirate had come up and shot me right then and there I probably wouldn't have cared. I felt sick to my ... \i everything\i0 .{&1310}\par It passed, though. Eventually, it passed.{&1310}\par I half threw up as I tried to pick myself back up from the deck. Drool was leaking out of the side of my mouth back down to the floor. I had to blink exasperatedly to clear my eyes and even that didn't do it so I tried scrubbign at them with an unresponsive hand. I ended up toppling over to one side.{&1310}\par \i You're going to die. The station is under attack and you're going to die. Get up or you're going to die here\i0 -{&1310}\par It must have taken me five whole minutes to slowly pick myself back up again. All the while I started to remember that scream and how close it had probably been. And how it had cut off.{&1310}\par I hobbled along a few steps forward. I had to catch my balance against the bulkhead. There were more labs here, branching off to either side and swimming in view as my brain felt like it was still trying to flop around inside my head. It took me a little while and another  meter or so of stumbling over myself to realize how much more wrecked these labs were than the ones in the next deck. Equipment was scattered all over the place like someone had raged out in one. I staggered to the other side of the corridor and noticed the shattered glass and blood in another. No body, though. I didn't find the first body until after I'd felt my hand scrape against the plasma scoring on the wall.\cf2\f1 {&1310}\par }{&1310}

There were plenty of people scattered around the room for the afternoon crowd, coming and going, eating and drinking in the sometimes-bright-sometimes-dark, off-color mood lighting. Tess muttered something under her breath I couldn't make out, but it sounded frustrated. Then I figured it out. Some guy in a ruffled jacket over a tech coat was standing just inside the front doors, looking around.

Her eyes bounced back and forth in a "what the fuck?" sort of way a few times before she finally did something, the whole while with me sitting there suddenly being eyeballed by her creepy-as-fuck wannabe boyfriend.{&1310}\par "Brant-?"{&1310}\par "Excuse me." His words practically jumped on top of hers in a rush to get out of his mouth. Then he was gone. Just ... gone. Just - a hasty, awkward scramble to climb over himself back toward the exit. We both watched him go.{&1310}\par "Woah," was all Tess could say about that for a few seconds. I glanced around the bar once he was gone to see if anyone else had noticed how fucking weird that way. I guess I was the only one, though. And Tess too.{&1310}\par "I can't figure out if he likes you," Tess finally continued, still staring, "or hates you."{&1310}\par "What is \i that\i0  supposed to mean?"{&1310}\par She ignored me, just shaking her head. Eventually she shrugged. "Either way, I guess he won't be bugging me as much if I keep you around. Oh \i god\i0 ," she abruptly slumped on her stool, "you'll be gone again \i way\i0  too soon."{&1310}\par  Before I could even get irritated at the fact that she was more worried about that guy harassing her than me \i leaving\i0  again, she had already pulled another cigarette and started to light up.{&1310}\par "Who the hell even \i was\i0  that guy?" I asked instead.{&1310}\par "I don't know," she shook her head, "or care." She breathed out smoke. "Not seeing me or anything, if that's what you think."{&1310}\par "I hope not."{&1310}\par "No fucking way. He just came in here some night a while ago and started hitting on me. I think I told you about him in one of those messages I sent you."{&1310}\par I remembered now. {&1310}\par "Yeah, I think so."{&1310}\par "He, uh, well I found out he was working in one of the more 'restricted' areas," she crooked her fingers in the air as she said it, "and I, well, I thought I'd get a closer look since he offered ..."{&1310}\par I almost burst out laughing, but I caught myself before the whole room heard it. Tess had a way too innocent look on her face as she said it not to laugh. "Anything interesting?" I managed to ask.{&1310}\par "Not really," she sighed, and deflated. Then she turned and tapped out ash from her cigarette on Bertram's side of the bar while he wasn't there and looking. "Not enough to put up with him creepin' on me all the time now. Fucking weirdo."{&1310}\par The kitchen doors flashed open and Tess' hand instantly withdrew from across the bar like it'd never been there. Too bad the first thing Bertram noticed as he came out with two steaming plates of what was supposed to look like beef, potatoes, and corn -- but was really just gussied up nutrient rations -- was that ash on the deck as he stepped in it.{&1310}\par "What the-"{&1310}\par He jumped back, looking sharply at his shoes. Then he stuck a fat finger in Tess' face. His own scrunched up into a craggy, pudgy mass. "I'm gonna leave that for your shift tonight!"{&1310}\par "Whaaat."{&1310}\par "Yeah, that's right, girl. Done more than my fair share of cleaning up after you. This one can wait. Just for \i you\i0 ."{&1310}\par "You mean I have to come in to\i night\i0 ? It's Ev's first day back!"{&1310}\par "I don't care if it's her fucking \i birthday\i0  you ..."{&1310}\par {&1310}\par \pard\sl480\slmult1\qc *\tab *\tab *{&1310}\par \pard\fi720\sl480\slmult1 "Tess ..." I mumbled to myself in the dark. "Dad? Bertram ... where are you?"{&1310}\par I was moving down the hallway toward where that scream had come from and I stumbled, pitching forward. A sharp pain lanced through my head like someone had just burned a hole between the backs of my eyes and-{&1310}\par "GET OUT!"{&1310}\par My face was squished up against the floor, some voice ringing in my ears. There was anger, flaring up and burning all the fear to ash. It drowned me inside it.{&1310}\par I worked to curl up into a little ball there against the deck -- to disappear intot he metal and vanish forever. I tried to cry out but nothing would come from my mouth. My eyes watered until I couldn't see and then I squeezed them shut.{&1310}\par Then, just as quickly as that pain had started -- it stopped.{&1310}\par I was lying on the floor, tears in my eyes, and struggling tob reathe.{&1310}\par What ...{&1310}\par ... the ...{&1310}\par I couldn't even finish the thought. It felt like someone had punched me right in the stomach and knocked the wind out of me except replace stomach with brain and wind with ... I didn't even know. Sanity? Consciousness? Probably that, since I lost time there, curled up int he dark. It was dizzying and enervating and for too long I couldn't even move -- didn't \i want\i0  to move.{&1310}\par If some pirate had come up and shot me right then and there I probably wouldn't have cared. I felt sick to my ... \i everything\i0 .{&1310}\par It passed, though. Eventually, it passed.{&1310}\par I half threw up as I tried to pick myself back up from the deck. Drool was leaking out of the side of my mouth back down to the floor. I had to blink exasperatedly to clear my eyes and even that didn't do it so I tried scrubbign at them with an unresponsive hand. I ended up toppling over to one side.{&1310}\par \i You're going to die. The station is under attack and you're going to die. Get up or you're going to die here\i0 -{&1310}\par It must have taken me five whole minutes to slowly pick myself back up again. All the while I started to remember that scream and how close it had probably been. And how it had cut off.{&1310}\par I hobbled along a few steps forward. I had to catch my balance against the bulkhead. There were more labs here, branching off to either side and swimming in view as my brain felt like it was still trying to flop around inside my head. It took me a little while and another  meter or so of stumbling over myself to realize how much more wrecked these labs were than the ones in the next deck. Equipment was scattered all over the place like someone had raged out in one. I staggered to the other side of the corridor and noticed the shattered glass and blood in another. No body, though. I didn't find the first body until after I'd felt my hand scrape against the plasma scoring on the wall.{&1310}\par More than one. I came up short in the next corridor and found at least half a dozen littered around the deck. Marines. \i Dead\i0  marines. They looked like they'd died defending the station.{&1310}\par I felt sick, seeing those bodies there. I could easily remember what this place looked like without them, and that had just been today. Yesterday? My head hurt and it was hard to tell. I had to fight the instinct to dry heave again as I dropped down to get a better look at the closest one.{&1310}\par He was heavy in full body armor and what must have a lot of augments. A corporal. I managed to turn him over and found his gun where he'd collapsed down face-first on top of it. I checked the rifle but it was even deader than that officer's pistol.{&1310}\par "What the \i fuck \i0 ..."{&1310}\par It was \i hard \i0 not to sound hopeless and lost. There was no reason why a fully-loaded marine would have a dead weapon. \i No\i0  reason. No fucking reason at all!{&1310}\par Then I noticed how cut up he was.{&1310}\par Freshly coagulating blood was leaking slowly onto the deck. I stared at it for a second with one hand holding his oversized bulk back from where his gun had lay, frowning. Then his LBV ripped just a bit more, armor cracked, and his whole body fell apart.{&1310}\par I fell over myself scrambling back away. That wet squelching noise ehcoed in the dim corridor, but all I could see was the silhouette of that fleshy viscera that had fallen out whent he dead marine disintegrated. My brain stopped working for a few seconds while it tried to process what it was looking at right in front of it.{&1310}\par Then, "what the fuck kind of weapon could do that?" was the only thought in my head for a long time. There weren't any holes like a firebolt would have left -- molten plasma punched right through stinking flesh. I couldn't even bring myself to tauch the armor and look for small arms scoring. It didn't matter. A knife? He'd been \i gutted\i0  right through his armor so fast and so badly that it was only the pieces keeping \i his\i0  pieces together. What kind of knife could do that? And who the hell would stab him that many times to kill him?{&1310}\par \i Fuck\i0 !{&1310}\par I found myself backed up against the wall again without realizing it. I was too numb and light-headed to puke, so I just got back up and teetered there. The rest of the bodies seemed just as bad off from a distance, but I couldn't think about it. I stumbled around and checked them for live weapons in a haze. {&1310}\par I did manage to find one that was only \i mostly\i0  depleted and I couldn't help wondering what the hell kind of good it would even do if a squad of marines with a hell of a lot more real combat experience than some fucking loser cadet couldn't survive whatever it was that had happened. An entire squad!{&1310}\par This deck was no better than the last one. \i Worse\i0 , really -- assuming mutilated bodies was worse than no bodies left at all. Was it? I didn't know what else I could possibly do, though. The maintenance tubes were locked down -- there was probably vacuum between me and everything else for all I fucking knew -- the power was out, the fucking lifts were fucking useless so I was trapped in here with whatever had killed those marines and-{&1310}\par I stopped again, and slumped back against one wall, mostly-dead pulse rifle in one hand and growled aloud in a helpless whisper, "What the fuck am I supposed to do!" It was hard not to collapse back down again. I guess keep going? Until I ran out of air. Or found someone who wasn't dead. Or found whatever it was that killed these marines.{&1310}\par A scream again. It echoed so loudly and suddenly that I jumped into the wall and nearly fell over one of the bodies. "Fuck you!" I hissed at it. My hands got the rifle back up way too late to do anything but hate myself for it. To bad there wasn't a fucking drill instructor around to scream at me for being fucking useless!{&1310}\par I swallowed. Hard. Then I tried to listen.{&1310}\par Nothing. {&1310}\par No ... movement. {&1310}\par Maybe?{&1310}\par Those creepy structural sounds you heard in vids when there was some freaky Tau monster around the corner, deeper in the abandoned colony or mining station or something. If you'd only seen vids you'd wonder why that whole system didn't just fall apart with all the genetic mutations and secret monstrosities and DNA resequencing gone wrong that'd then be unleashed on some terrified fictional people. But ... I'd never seen anything but vids. I only knew that they did do a lot of genetic research and the Navy knew firsthand how well they could weaponize it. They always said stuff like the pirates were secretly funded by Tau military sects. And if anyone was going to lose a real, live monster on anyone -- it was Tau.{&1310}\par No, no, no -- I didn't like where that thought was going.\cf2\f1 {&1310}\par }{&1310}
