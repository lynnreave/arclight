Let alone, wandering out of that wood."{&1310}\par I blinked up from my half-sleep daze at the old man, swiping a hand at my eyes when he refused to go away and let me just collapse in on myself right there.{&1310}\par "What?"{&1310}\par "I said - it's been some time since I've seen a single person out these parts," he repeated. I even caught a little of it this time. I bobbed my head, still trying to be out of it in the front seat.{&1310}\par "Uh huh."{&1310}\par That road was little better than gravel and dirt. It certainly wasn't making it any easier to nod off while sitting up. Another jagged hole in it jarred me abruptly up again as the whole car bounced into the air. The old man gave me an apologetic look.{&1310}\par "Sorry 'bout that, miss."{&1310}\par He replaced a pipe in between his teeth as I just sat there too tired to even be miserable and wishing that it were anything like the planetside roads I always saw in the vids. You never saw the people in the tossed around like wet sacks, even sitting in a backwards little automotive like that. Somehow, it had always seemed more ... romantic.{&1310}\par "While I've got you awake," he mumbled around that pipe at me, "I've been meanin' to ask before we get back to town. What were y'all doin' out here anyhow? Not a soul around for a hundred miles out that way that I've heard of. It just be luck that I was on my way back from looking in on an old friend of mine."{&1310}\par He kept driving, though he threw a couple looks my way.{&1310}\par "What?" I groaned out again, having a hard time following him what with running all through the day and night without any sleep. Whatever Jules had said about shorter cycles, I couldn't believe it right then. {&1310}\par "We were ... we crashed out in the woods," I managed with a trying grunt. I could almost wish the eluvian man hadn't passed out so quickly from his wounds when we just happened upon that old man in his antique vehicle. It was still the dead of night, but we saw the lights at the head of the thing for a whole kilometer off. Somehow ... somehow we had found some old backwater road after all that non-stop running through the boonies.{&1310}\par "You and that tattooed fella with the girl back there?" He nodded his head at the mirror between us, where he had a good look at Jules and Ev in the back seat. "You doin' all right back there, young lady?"{&1310}\par The eluvian man was unconscious, though I couldn't tell if he was still bleeding bad. I think the run with Ev had just finally taken its toll on him after fighting that ... whatever it was, out in the woods. But Ev was awake. If you could call it that. She was staring dully out into the space outside a window back behind me. She hadn't opened her mouth or seemed to register any of us since coming back last night.{&1310}\par "She talk much?" the old man asked me with a cheerful wink that just made me groan with how absolutely exhausted I was. I shook my head. {&1310}\par "Nope. Never has before."{&1310}\par It was hard to be too grateful for him saving us from an even longer walk with how he just wouldn't let me pass out.{&1310}\par I guess I must have without realizing it, though, because another bump in the road knocked me roughly back awake and I realized we were somewhere different. I glared out the window, confused, for a few seconds. Then I glanced back at the old man.{&1310}\par "Are those, uh, farms?" I stuck a finger toward the sprawling, plowed-looking fields out to either side of us as we drove.{&1310}\par "Sure are, miss," he gave me another wink. How long had I been passed out? "You all on your way to Dreggoran and the Door?"{&1310}\par I nodded, as much because I didn't care as I didn't know. Maybe that's where old Weir and Ev had been headed. That message I'd seen in his private communications box hadn't said much about it. But ...{&1310}\par "Where are we?"{&1310}\par I rounded on the old man again, even though he'd been chattering on about something else again. I hadn't heard a word of it.{&1310}\par He frowned, interrupting whatever thought he had been chewing on with his pipe out loud. "You don't know?" he asked, surprised. But then he just shrugged it off, and gave a little wave of his hand inside that cramped cabin.{&1310}\par "I like to call this little piece of rural paradise - Lyricum." He smild at me around that pipe, and flipped the red cap on his head with his free hand real quick. "But don't you mind what the rest of these folks'll tell you. It's not so bad once you get to know it."{&1310}\par I just settled back in my chair, trying to remember everything from that message to old Weir. Something about Lyricum, I remembered. There'd been two people staying there that were supposed to know him. I wouldn't think the transport cruiser would have stopped at a little place like that, but they were supposed to be hanging around there, waiting for something, I guess. And whoever sent the thing to Ev's dad sounded like they must have been friends. He only signed with his initials, anyways.{&1310}\par "You'll probably be wanting to head on out toward the big, old port then," he continued agreeably with another flounce of his hat, "I'd imagine. No other way to get out toward the Door."{&1310}\par Again, I nodded, staring out at those fields now. If I kept looking too hard, I thought I would see a familiar, black figure out there in those wavy threshes. The automotive wasn't moving too quick, but certainly a lot faster than we had been doing on foot. And I had no idea what Jules might have done to that \i thing\i0  out in the woods. He had gotten away alive anyways. {&1310}\par I would blink again, and it would be gone. I was seeing things, and daydreaming between sleeping fits.{&1310}\par The next time I woke up it was because the old man was shaking my shoulder. My eyes snapped back open, but this time I had a headache. I grabbed at my forehead with one hand, giving him a dirty look.{&1310}\par "We're here, miss," was all he said. Then I looked up and around, and we were suddenly in some kind of dirty little town.{&1310}\par "Where the hell are we?" I asked, fighting back that throbbing in my skull. Jules was suddenly at my hatch, though, pulling it open.{&1310}\par "Come on," he grunted down at me before moving on to Ev in the back.{&1310}\par I got a good look at all those planetside buildings thrusting up from the ground into the sky without a care for bulkheads or running out of space in that airy emptiness.{&1310}\par Eventually, I remembered the old man, and rounded back on him after I had already started closing the passenger-side hatch. I caught it with a hip, instantly regretting it, and pushed the thing back open with a wince. I ducked down inside where he was waiting with a kind look on his face.{&1310}\par "Thank you, Mr. Anders," I managed rather graciously, despite my mood and my sudden headache. He smiled back, and turned to his steering wheel.{&1310}\par "Don't mention it, miss. Theresa was it? Just trying to do my part." He puffed out his beard and mustaches, swiping at that pipe. "And it's just Anders." He stuck it out at me. "You take care of that friend of yours, you hear?"{&1310}\par I groaned inwardly as I pulled back out and let him drive off elsewhere into that town. When had I told him \i that\i0 ? No one ever called me that. Why the hell would I tell him? I must have \i really\i0  been out of it.{&1310}\par "We'll have to find the rail station," Jules was saying, giving that dusty, old place a hard, unwelcoming look. It didn't soften much when it swept over me and Ev. "Get moving."{&1310}\par "Come on," I mumbled in Ev's ear, taking her arm in one hand. I had to drag her a bit to get her moving. She didn't say a single thing - just kept staring off into space with those tears in her eyes.{&1310}\par I followed Jules.\cf2\f1 {&1310}\par }{&1310}

It didn't help that we were all covered in old blood and Ev was like a walking corpse.{&1310}\par "Come on," I mumbled in Ev's ear, taking her arm in one hand. She didn't say a single thing - just kept staring off into space with those tears in her eyes.

That message I'd seen in his private communications box hadn't said much about it. But ...{&1310}\par "Where are we?"{&1310}\par I rounded on the old man again, even though he'd been chattering on about something else again. I hadn't heard a word of it.{&1310}\par He frowned, interrupting whatever thought he had been chewing on with his pipe out loud. "You don't know?" he asked, surprised. But then he just shrugged it off, and gave a little wave of his hand inside that cramped cabin.{&1310}\par "I like to call this little piece of rural paradise - Lyricum." He smild at me around that pipe, and flipped the red cap on his head with his free hand real quick. "But don't you mind what the rest of these folks'll tell you. It's not so bad once you get to know it."{&1310}\par I just settled back in my chair, trying to remember everything from that message to old Weir. Something about Lyricum, I remembered. There'd been two people staying there that were supposed to know him. I wouldn't think the transport cruiser would have stopped at a little place like that, but they were supposed to be hanging around there, waiting for something, I guess. And whoever sent the thing to Ev's dad sounded like they must have been friends. He only signed with his initials, anyways.{&1310}\par "You'll probably be wanting to head on out toward the big, old port then," he continued agreeably with another flounce of his hat, "I'd imagine. No other way to get out toward the Door."{&1310}\par Again, I nodded, staring out at those fields now. If I kept looking too hard, I thought I would see a familiar, black figure out there in those wavy threshes. The automotive wasn't moving too quick, but certainly a lot faster than we had been doing on foot. And I had no idea what Jules might have done to that \i thing\i0  out in the woods. He had gotten away alive anyways. {&1310}\par I would blink again, and it would be gone. I was seeing things, and daydreaming between sleeping fits.{&1310}\par The next time I woke up it was because the old man was shaking my shoulder. My eyes snapped back open, but this time I had a headache. I grabbed at my forehead with one hand, giving him a dirty look.{&1310}\par "We're here, miss," was all he said. Then I looked up and around, and we were suddenly in some kind of dirty little town.{&1310}\par "Where the hell are we?" I asked, fighting back that throbbing in my skull. Jules was suddenly at my hatch, though, pulling it open.{&1310}\par "Come on," he grunted down at me before moving on to Ev in the back.{&1310}\par I got a good look at all those planetside buildings thrusting up from the ground into the sky without a care for bulkheads or running out of space in that airy emptiness.{&1310}\par Eventually, I remembered the old man, and rounded back on him after I had already started closing the passenger-side hatch. I caught it with a hip, instantly regretting it, and pushed the thing back open with a wince. I ducked down inside where he was waiting with a kind look on his face.{&1310}\par "Thank you, Mr. Anders," I managed rather graciously, despite my mood and my sudden headache. He smiled back, and turned to his steering wheel.{&1310}\par "Don't mention it, miss. Theresa was it? Just trying to do my part." He puffed out his beard and mustaches, swiping at that pipe. "And it's just Anders." He stuck it out at me. "You take care of that friend of yours, you hear?"{&1310}\par I groaned inwardly as I pulled back out and let him drive off elsewhere into that town. When had I told him \i that\i0 ? No one ever called me that. Why the hell would I tell him? I must have \i really\i0  been out of it.{&1310}\par "We'll have to find the rail station," Jules was saying, giving that dusty, old place a hard, unwelcoming look. It didn't soften much when it swept over me and Ev. "Get moving."{&1310}\par "Come on," I mumbled in Ev's ear, taking her arm in one hand. I had to drag her a bit to get her moving. She didn't say a single thing - just kept staring off into space with those tears in her eyes.{&1310}\par I followed Jules.\cf2\f1 {&1310}\par }{&1310}
