Not that there was anything to clean up for, but it was hard not to enjoy being able to bathe regularly after the transport cruiser and getting lost in the wilderness. As small as it was, Richter's shower looked much less risky than Matthias' back in Shtess. At least, before the other day it had.{&1310}\par "Is that it?" Tess abruptly butted in from behind, pointing at what the man had carried in under one arm.{&1310}\par "Oh. Yes." He glanced down at the bundle before holding it up for us. "They're the latest from Dreggoran, and quite popular right now."{&1310}\par "Ugh."{&1310}\par Tess made a sound in her throat as her face twisted. She unfolded the coat she'd snatched from him, looking less than happy about wearing it. It certainly didn't compare to the clothes she usually liked to throw on.{&1310}\par Richter handed me the other one and I unfolded it to see what Tess didn't like. It was long, tight-fighting, and fairly starched compared to what were used to back home. The neck was high, and it was a stark, conservative black. Plain and utilitarian, but still a little elegant with those fine scrolls on the hem you almost didn't notice. It was subtle. Not really Tess' style at all.{&1310}\par I hadn't paid much attention to Dreggoran fashion in the vids, but it seemed to fit, and most of the people I'd seen around there so far wore something similar at least. I supposed wearing those things would make us a bit less noticeable anyways. {&1310}\par "Hey, Ev ... look."{&1310}\par I glanced over at Tess having slipped into her Dreggoran coat. Or I guess that wasn't quite right. She'd done it up so tight it looked more like someone had \i stuffed \i0 her into it.{&1310}\par "Tax evasion is treason!" she stood stock still with a too-somber, too-earnest look on her spaced-out face. "All men twenty years or older must register with the DFB for mandatory enlistment!"{&1310}\par I laughed, and I couldn't help it. The image struck me so hard that I nearly doubled over, the sound bursting out of my mouth before I could catch it. Richter's face flushed bright red beneath his flaxen hair as I saw him get truly angry for the first time since I'd met him. I tried to cover my mouth to hide since I don't think he liked her impression of those government-sponsored messages they flashed around here.{&1310}\par "Sectarians!" he snapped, looking awkward even doing that like he suddenly had all that anger and wasn't sure just what to even do with it. His lip quivered as he ranted. "It might all be a big fucking joke to you, but you won't be laughing when the day comes the Grand Admirals decide to throw your part of the sector to the void."{&1310}\par He glared at us both, flushed and angry. Our laughter died down into ragged, punctuated peals. I look at Tess.{&1310}\par "What did he call us?"{&1310}\par She shrugged.{&1310}\par "I couldn't hear him over this collar!" {&1310}\par She pretened to gasp, pulling at the thing tight on her neck with her fingers. I lost it again.{&1310}\par Richter eventually had enough and stormed off to the side of the room that served as both the kitchen and dining room. Tess and I kept laughing for a bit at his expense while he downed some of that non-alcoholic tonic he seemed to love so much, looking embarassed and put off. For a few minutes, I forgot everything else that had happened, and it was just like being back home. For a few minutes.{&1310}\par \pard\fi720\sl480\slmult1 {&1310}\par }{&1310}
