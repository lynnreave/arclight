Screaming into the air, Julian flung her out. I jumped ahead of him before he could turn on me. I looked, tucked in, and hit the ground in a rush, rolling and tumbling over into a flurry of dirt. I missed the tracks. Tess didn't. And she was out cold when we picked her up a few minutes later.{&1310}\par Julian said it was fine.{&1310}\par It was pitch black in there, like falling into an endless void, as I watched the train leave us quickly behind. I didn't know where we had been going, or why, and a sudden despair of being utterly lost rushed in to choke me with unseen hands as soon as that thundering machine was gone.{&1310}\par I think I blacked out to nightmares for a minute, because the next thing I knew that man was crouching down and shining a light inmy eyes.{&1310}\par We found Tess after that, looking like she'd tried to crack her skull open on the way down to the ground. But Julian said she was fine. We just rested there in sudden silence for a little longer as the echoes of the train faded away into the distance. Then he heaved her up with a groan, and started off. I followed.{&1310}\par We were drowning in a sea of blackness. But for that light Julian had. He climbed up out of the pit where the rail tracks lay onto a narrow concrete platform. We followed that for a long time in the dark and the quiet of nothing but small scurrying things out of sight. Then a rusted old hatch opened up to our right of a sudden. A few bolts from his rifle and Julian had it back open.{&1310}\par His light flickered over some steps leading up in the dark. Spiderwebs covered the landing. And so did the biggest spider I had ever seen.{&1310}\par I froze up, skin crawling all over as it slinked up and away from the light. Even after Julian let loose a shot to to fry the thing, my skin itched and I couldn't shake the thought of it crawling. I swear it shrieked at us as that bolt of fire turned it into smoldering cinders with legs curling in.{&1310}\par The room above was small, cluttered with decayed furniture and garbage. Julian siad it looked like an abandoned service station. I suppose that made sense. He found the door and revealed night settled on sparse, rocky fields outside.{&1310}\par I got a good look at the sky when he said it would be morning again soon. A big, luminescent orb hung there toward one horizon, swirling with more color and life than anything else against the starry black void. One of the most beautiful things I had ever seen in my life.{&1310}\par "Dreggoran," Julian grunted when he caught me staring. Then turned around and headed back inside without another thought.{&1310}\par Somewhere safe. That was where Dad had said we were going.{&1310}\par That planet loomed up in the dark sky on an alien world and I could almost see the shards of my life still splintering around me into even tinier fragments. And they just cut my hands if I tried to grab them.{&1310}\par Tess' head was all puffy and swollen beside a gash on the side of it. Julian checked her again, briefly. I came back in and knelt down across from him with her between us.{&1310}\par "Who are you?" I asked when he was done. {&1310}\par He barely more than glanced my way. "Does it matter?" he grunted back.{&1310}\par I guessed not.{&1310}\par Another few minutes passed into an hour of just sitting there doing nothing. Resting, maybe. Julian got up and made sure to close that hatch again behind us at one point. He even braced it with random junk from around the room, and I wondered why he bothered. That thing was long gone.{&1310}\par It got lighter outside. The sun came up, I think. That tattooed man was up and moving before then, though. I didn't have much reason not to just do as he said and follow.{&1310}\par Tess woke up, groggy and complaining about her head. Julian had poured something over the gash and bandaged it while she was out. It might have looked funny - red-stained white popping out of the side of her mussed, pink hair - if I had felt like laughing. I didn't.{&1310}\par That complaining quickly turned to freaking out, though. When she realized she had been cut and bleeding. She started shrieking something about infection, and Julian told her he cleaned it as quickly as he could. He wasn't very convincing, I supposed, because Tess didn't look too convinced by that. And she kept fretting about it the rest of the day as we started up trudging along the outside of the train tunnel toward wherever that tattooed man decided we should go.{&1310}\par Time passed by in jerking spurts. Slow. And the fast. I stared down at my feet - looked up, and an hour had passed. Landmarks had already faded behind. Then seconds would crawl by so slowly. I thought they'd choke the life out of me. The air felt thick, and heavy, and never stopped moving. It made it hard to breath.{&1310}\par "Are you okay, Ev?" Tess tugged at my elbow somewhere along the bleak way of rocky hills sprouting up and leaving those less bumpy flatlands behind.{&1310}\par I jerked at the touch without realizing it, forgetting she was even there and real for a while. Then I abruptly wondered why she was.{&1310}\par "I kind of ... followed you," she told me later, trudging beside that stony bluff Julian had said the train tunnel ran right through. So strange.{&1310}\par "I hid in one of the storage closets for two days. Just don't ask me how I got ot the head. You know Old Weir-do never sleeps."{&1310}\par He does now, I thought suddenly then. Tess laughed it off, but I could tell her heart just wasn't in it. I almost wished that I could laugh. But the thought of it still cut so deep.{&1310}\par I asked about the tattooed man when she told me about crashing on the moon, and she said he was Eluvian. I hadn't see in it, though I supposed he had the profile and features. Tall, and well-proportioned. Handsome, in a timeless sort of way if you squinted through the harshness and grime. Tess had always been more into that stuff than me. But I had always thought the Eluvians were supposed to be very peaceful. Not carrying around guns and fighting monsters on some moon in the middle of nowhere.{&1310}\par "I know, right?" Tess shook her head at me. "I think he was hunting pirates. Or something."{&1310}\par It was hard for her to bury all that excitement in misery. She had wanted to go planetside as much as I had. It was probably why she had snuck along in the first place. Too bad things had turned out worse than either of us could have ever imagined back in Riftwatch. I think Dad had tried to tell me that.{&1310}\par "Why is he here then?"{&1310}\par Stuck there on that moon running for their lives seemed like the last place anyone else should have been. He didn't know us.{&1310}\par Apparently Tess had put up a distress beacon as soon as she found me, though, and that had lured him in.{&1310}\par "I don't think he really wanted to help us," she whispered to me behind his back as he set a breakneck marching pace ahead.{&1310}\par "Then why is he?"{&1310}\par She just shrugged.{&1310}\par "If I were him, I'd have left us behind a long time ago."{&1310}\par She didn't really explain that, or why he might be so eager to abandon us - comlete and total strangers or otherwise. But I had seen Tess provoke him back at the station. I knew her well enough to suppose at what she might have done to piss him off. Still, I had seen him nearly get himself killed putting hismelf between us and that thing back on the train too.{&1310}\par "Do you know what that ... it was?" Tess asked, reading my mind. Or maybe she just saw the white in my face at the memory. Either way, I shook my head.{&1310}\par "I saw something like it," I managed. And swallowed down the bile in my throat. "Back on the transport ship."{&1310}\par We slowed enough at one point for her to catch up and ask Julian what it was as well, but his answer was even less helpful.{&1310}\par "No," he grunted at her, keeping his rifle low and to the dirt as he moved. "But it didn't belong here."{&1310}\par "What the hell's that supposed to mean?"{&1310}\par He didn't answer her for a time, preoccupied with everything else around him. I listened in just the same when he did.{&1310}\par "I could feel it," he continued in a low, absent voice. "Like a nail scratching on steel." And then he just repeated himself. "It didn't belong here."{&1310}\par And that was as much as she got out of him. It reminded me a little of how Dad had sounded before we ran off into that man and he -{&1310}\par I don't know how long we walked. Everything dimmed as that planet in the sky dipped down toward the horizon. I saw stars in empty space, but the formations weren't familiar anymore. The air was thick, moist, and made my tongue taste like twigs and weeds. It made me dizzy sometimes. Tess, too, I could tell. But Julian kept on hard.{&1310}\par I was tired, and breathless, when he finally stopped again. Not that it mattered. Wherever we were going - we were finally there.{&1310}\par The tunnel must have ended, because tracks came shooting out of the ground beside us and through a gate off into the distance.{&1310}\par "Is that the space port?"{&1310}\par It was Tess who asked. Flagging and hunched over, with her arms flopping listlessly at her sides, she managed to throw one that way and cough a few words out. Julian just shook his head.{&1310}\par "No."{&1310}\par "So - " Tess huffed back at him, twisting her head around forlornly. "What the hell ... What's it then?"{&1310}\par It was a step up from the washed-out town we left behind. A lot of long, squat, and port-less buildings with large doors. Too large for people. Further on there were some different kinds clustered at the middle of it all, looking packed-in but much more live-able. A huge toward stretched up from the middle of them into the sky there. I lost the top of it in the clouds.{&1310}\par "That will go to the port," Julian said, canting his head toward the tower.{&1310}\par It was more for himself than us, though. Some reassurance. Because he started down toward that place without another word. Tess just groaned, and stumbled after.\cf2\f2 {&1310}\par }{&1310}

A big, luminescent orb hung there toward one horizon, swirling with more color and life than anything else against the starry black void. One of the most beautiful things I had ever seen in my life.{&1310}\par "Dreggoran," Julian grunted when he caught me staring.

"Does it matter?" he grunted back.{&1310}\par I guessed not.{&1310}\par Another few minutes passed into an hour of just sitting there doing nothing. Resting, maybe. Julian got up and made sure to close that hatch again behind us at one point. He even braced it with random junk from around the room, and I wondered why he bothered. That thing was long gone.{&1310}\par It got lighter outside. The sun came up, I think. That tattooed man was up and moving before then, though. I didn't have much reason not to just do as he said and follow.{&1310}\par Tess woke up, groggy and complaining about her head.

It might have looked funny - red-stained white popping out of the side of her mussed, pink hair - if I had felt like laughing. I didn't.{&1310}\par That complaining quickly turned to freaking out, though. When she realized she had been cut and bleeding. She started shrieking something about infection, and Julian told her he cleaned it as quickly as he could. He wasn't very convincing, I supposed, because Tess didn't look too convinced by that. And she kept fretting about it the rest of the day as we started up trudging along the outside of the train tunnel toward wherever that tattooed man decided we should go.{&1310}\par Time passed by in jerking spurts.

But I had seen Tess provoke him back at the station. I knew her well enough to suppose at what she might have done to piss him off. Still, I had seen him nearly get himself killed putting hismelf between us and that thing back on the train too.{&1310}\par "Do you know what that ... it was?" Tess asked, reading my mind. Or maybe she just saw the white in my face at the memory. Either way, I shook my head.{&1310}\par "I saw something like it," I managed. And swallowed down the bile in my throat. "Back on the transport ship."{&1310}\par We slowed enough at one point for her to catch up and ask Julian what it was as well, but his answer was even less helpful.{&1310}\par "No," he grunted at her, keeping his rifle low and to the dirt as he moved. "But it didn't belong here."{&1310}\par "What the hell's that supposed to mean?"{&1310}\par He didn't answer her for a time, preoccupied with everything else around him. I listened in just the same when he did.{&1310}\par "I could feel it," he continued in a low, absent voice. "Like a nail scratching on steel." And then he just repeated himself. "It didn't belong here."{&1310}\par And that was as much as she got out of him. It reminded me a little of how Dad had sounded before we ran off into that man and he -{&1310}\par I don't know how long we walked. Everything dimmed as that planet in the sky dipped down toward the horizon. I saw stars in empty space, but the formations weren't familiar anymore. The air was thick, moist, and made my tongue taste like twigs and weeds. It made me dizzy sometimes. Tess, too, I could tell. But Julian kept on hard.{&1310}\par I was tired, and breathless, when he finally stopped again. Not that it mattered. Wherever we were going - we were finally there.{&1310}\par The tunnel must have ended, because tracks came shooting out of the ground beside us and through a gate off into the distance.{&1310}\par "Is that the space port?"{&1310}\par It was Tess who asked. Flagging and hunched over, with her arms flopping listlessly at her sides, she managed to throw one that way and cough a few words out. Julian just shook his head.{&1310}\par "No."{&1310}\par "So - " Tess huffed back at him, twisting her head around forlornly. "What the hell ... What's it then?"{&1310}\par It was a step up from the washed-out town we left behind. A lot of long, squat, and port-less buildings with large doors. Too large for people. Further on there were some different kinds clustered at the middle of it all, looking packed-in but much more live-able. A huge toward stretched up from the middle of them into the sky there. I lost the top of it in the clouds.{&1310}\par "That will go to the port," Julian said, canting his head toward the tower.{&1310}\par It was more for himself than us, though. Some reassurance. Because he started down toward that place without another word. Tess just groaned, and stumbled after.\cf2\f2 {&1310}\par }{&1310}
