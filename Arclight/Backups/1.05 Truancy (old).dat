I guess I was getting real good at that.{&1310}\par Ressler might have been small, but he was a lot of wiry, corded muscle. I could still hear him shouting at the top of his lungs behind me when I made it to the central archive offices. He would have caught me there, too, if I hadn't found one I recognized and slipped quickly inside.{&1310}\par I guess it was just my luck that it wouldn't be empty today.{&1310}\par "Ms. Wier," a tall, old woman in thick glasses sitting behind a too-small desk greeted with no small amount of admonishment for the sweating and puffing young woman with an armful of carrying bags that burst into her office. She stopped what she was writing out on her screen, and looked up at me.{&1310}\par "I don't rememer any lessons scheduled for today. Is there something I can help you with?"{&1310}\par I didn't give her much of an answer, though. It was too late to turn back now. So I just shook my head as vigorously as I could and leapt around the shelf by the door, squeezing into the corner without a word.{&1310}\par The old woman was still staring at me sternly over her glasses as I tried to maneuver my bags better into the space to hide. I didn't get very far by the time I heard heavy footsteps clomping past just outside. I just put a finger to my lips for the woman, and held my breath.{&1310}\par The door hadn't closed. And Ressler must have taken that for an invitation. The old woman's eyes flashed back toward the open doorway as the short man puffed his way up to it. He caught himself there.{&1310}\par "Sorry to bother you, Eleanor," he started after a moment, the polite tone contrasting harshly enough with the past few minutes for me to scowl there in the corner. "Mrs. Sweeney," he amended. "But did you see that black-eyed brat run through here just now?"{&1310}\par The old woman just folded her wrinkled hands carefully with a small smile.{&1310}\par "And which brat would that be, Ressler?"{&1310}\par I could hear him sigh loudly in the door. He made it sound more like a grunt.{&1310}\par "Nolan's kid. Not the other one."{&1310}\par "Oh." Eleanor shook her head ever so slightly. Then turned her attention back to whatever she had been working on before I showed up.{&1310}\par "No. I can't say that I have."{&1310}\par Ressler stood there for a few moments longer. I would have sighed in relief, had I dared. But I settled for shouting how much I loved that old woman inside my head instead. I hoped Elle even heard me.{&1310}\par "Then why was your door open?"{&1310}\par That caught me up. I stiffened, and nearly blurted something out before I could stop it. I didn't, though.{&1310}\par Elle didn't even miss a beat. She just looked leisurely back toward Ressler at the door, and smiled.{&1310}\par "I like the fresh air."{&1310}\par I guess that was enough for him. I waited on pins and needles while he sighed heartily at the door. Then apologized and left.{&1310}\par "Now, tell me, Evelyn," the old woman was demanding after he had gone. "Why did I just lie to poor Ressler?" Her tone had turned harsh again. "He works so hard to keep this place in working order ..."{&1310}\par I was too busy sliding down against the bulkhead with my back in relief. The bags touched down around me, and I just sat there for a few seconds, feeling much better.{&1310}\par "Evelyn."{&1310}\par "What? Oh." I blinked my eyes back open. "I forgot to do something for him," came the tentative excuse. "But it's really too late now."{&1310}\par Surprisingly, the old woman took that for what it was.{&1310}\par "Ah. Your father told me you were leaving today." She looked back to her work, as if the matter was done. I just leapt back to my feet at that.{&1310}\par "He was here?"{&1310}\par She nodded at me, glancing up once more. {&1310}\par "About an hour ago. Just picked up some of his work from the past few months and said his goodbyes," she waved a spotted hand aside. "Seemed like he was in quite a hurry."{&1310}\par "Where did he go?" I had the edge of her desk clutched under my knuckles at that, leaning forward.{&1310}\par She regarded me for a moment. I guess I was being a bit overbearing, and I eased back a bit. She took off her glasses to wipe at them with a sleeve. {&1310}\par "I'm not sure. But if he's planning on leaving the station," she gave me that wise, old thoughtful tone, "I would think he would have to go through the shuttle bay at some point. Wouldn't you agree?"{&1310}\par "Oh my god ... Yes."{&1310}\par I twisted away, frustrated. It made perfect sense, of course. But I hadn't thought of it. Not in all those hours I spent running around looking uselessly.{&1310}\par And he would have assumed I was smarter than that. His mistake.{&1310}\par "Thanks, Elle!"{&1310}\par I was almost out the door again without a second thought. Almost. I ended up smacking straight into a wall, though, instead. An invisible one.{&1310}\par I managed to stumble back a step without falling flat on my ass. When I came back around, Elle was sitting there smirking in that patient way she had. She extended an elegant finger back toward the corner.{&1310}\par "I hope you're not planning on leaving those here with me."{&1310}\par "Oh. Right."{&1310}\par As I trudged back over and grabbed my bags again, she squinted hard with her eyes. And when I got back to the door, that wall was gone.{&1310}\par "Evelyn?"{&1310}\par "Yes?"{&1310}\par I came back around at the last before slipping all the way out. The older woman didn't say anything, though. Just smiled at me and shook her head. I smiled back.{&1310}\par Then I left.{&1310}\par }{&1310}

He made it sound more like a grunt.{&1310}\par "Nolan's kid. Not the other one."{&1310}\par "Oh." Eleanor shook her head ever so slightly. Then turned her attention back to whatever she had been working on before I showed up.{&1310}\par "No. I can't say that I have."{&1310}\par Ressler stood there for a few moments longer. I would have sighed in relief, had I dared. But I settled for shouting how much I loved that old woman inside my head instead. I hoped Elle even heard me.{&1310}\par "Then why was your door open?"{&1310}\par That caught me up. I stiffened, and nearly blurted something out before I could stop it. I didn't, though.{&1310}\par Elle didn't even miss a beat. She just looked leisurely back toward Ressler at the door, and smiled.{&1310}\par "I like the fresh air."{&1310}\par I guess that was enough for him. I waited on pins and needles while he sighed heartily at the door. Then apologized and left.{&1310}\par "Now, tell me, Evelyn," the old woman was demanding after he had gone. "Why did I just lie to poor Ressler?" Her tone had turned harsh again. "He works so hard to keep this place in working order ..."{&1310}\par I was too busy sliding down against the bulkhead with my back in relief. The bags touched down around me, and I just sat there for a few seconds, feeling much better.{&1310}\par "Evelyn."{&1310}\par "What? Oh." I blinked my eyes back open. "I forgot to do something for him," came the tentative excuse. "But it's really too late now."{&1310}\par Surprisingly, the old woman took that for what it was.{&1310}\par "Ah. Your father told me you were leaving today." She looked back to her work, as if the matter was done. I just leapt back to my feet at that.{&1310}\par "He was here?"{&1310}\par She nodded at me, glancing up once more. {&1310}\par "About an hour ago. Just picked up some of his work from the past few months and said his goodbyes," she waved a spotted hand aside. "Seemed like he was in quite a hurry."{&1310}\par "Where did he go?" I had the edge of her desk clutched under my knuckles at that, leaning forward.{&1310}\par She regarded me for a moment. I guess I was being a bit overbearing, and I eased back a bit. She took off her glasses to wipe at them with a sleeve. {&1310}\par "I'm not sure. But if he's planning on leaving the station," she gave me that wise, old thoughtful tone, "I would think he would have to go through the shuttle bay at some point. Wouldn't you agree?"{&1310}\par "Oh my god ... Yes."{&1310}\par I twisted away, frustrated. It made perfect sense, of course. But I hadn't thought of it. Not in all those hours I spent running around looking uselessly.{&1310}\par And he would have assumed I was smarter than that. His mistake.{&1310}\par "Thanks, Elle!"{&1310}\par I was almost out the door again without a second thought. Almost. I ended up smacking straight into a wall, though, instead. An invisible one.{&1310}\par I managed to stumble back a step without falling flat on my ass. When I came back around, Elle was sitting there smirking in that patient way she had. She extended an elegant finger back toward the corner.{&1310}\par "I hope you're not planning on leaving those here with me."{&1310}\par "Oh. Right."{&1310}\par As I trudged back over and grabbed my bags again, she squinted hard with her eyes. And when I got back to the door, that wall was gone.{&1310}\par "Evelyn?"{&1310}\par "Yes?"{&1310}\par I came back around at the last before slipping all the way out. The older woman didn't say anything, though. Just smiled at me and shook her head. I smiled back.{&1310}\par Then I left.{&1310}\par }{&1310}
