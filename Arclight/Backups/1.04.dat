I was just lucky they didn't try to use any Peekay on me up there on the ramparts criss-crossing the courtyards. There must have been enough people close by not to risk. I knew for a fact they would have been worse than expelled if they tried anything like that on me outside of class. Dad would have made sure of it.{&1310}\par I had passed out on the floor this time - barely making it through the door to my room before I just didn't feel like walking anymore. For that, I got a bunch of red creases on the side of my face to sport around for the next couple hours after I woke up. My legs were all but boneless too. I managed to shower, get dressed, and drag myself back out the door an hour later.{&1310}\par Jonathon didn't put me through too many paces when I finally showed up at his place, feeling forlorn and about ready for the final blow to come crashing down. He surprised me by just having us do a lot of stretches. Mostly to make up for how wrecked yesterday had made me, I realized after a while of guessing at what new game he was playing to torture me. Assuming that was actually true, I guess he wasn't as much of a hard-ass as he would have liked me to think. Still, it had been pretty rough.{&1310}\par I was in Dr. Sweeney's office a few hours after that, just sitting back in one of her big, easy chairs and trying not to fall asleep. I almost had a few times on Jonathon with how slow some of those stretches could end up being. After asking me a bit about how I was doing and feeling and getting a rambling account of why I was so dead-tired, she pulled out a pad on me.{&1310}\par "So. You collapsed in Holloway's class again," she read. And then glanced up at me. "Another dream?"{&1310}\par Elle was over six feet tall and I was almost lying down, so it was really glancing down for her. But I nodded my head, keeping my eyes shut for the most part.{&1310}\par "Something new? Or another of the same from before?"{&1310}\par I told her it was nothing knew. I'd had that one about the man getting chased by whatever those things were and finding the woman in the river. All the details were the same. Everything black, and dead or dying. She ran me through them, over and over. Just like always. I thought maybe she was trying to see if I would say something different, but I wasn't sure what that would tell her.{&1310}\par "Still seen through his eyes?" she asked, leaning back with her eyes on me and sipping at some tea or coffee in her mug.{&1310}\par "Like I was right there," I told her with a flippant wave of my hand. "Like I was him doing it."{&1310}\par I could feel every shot fired, and the recoil up my arm. Every friend of his butchered right there in the woods in front me was mine. The weight of that woman as he charged through the trees, running. Even the dank, slimy feel of that muck from the dead river he got on his hands after pulling her out.{&1310}\par I felt his thoughts like they were my own. I knew him then, like I knew myself. But I'd never met him, or any of them, before in my life. I guess that was just as well because I was pretty sure they were all dead now anyways.{&1310}\par That dream always left me rubbing just beneath my shoulder for a few days afterwards. Where the thing had stabbed him right through. I kept expecting to find a bleeding hole.{&1310}\par "So what were you doing just before it happened?"{&1310}\par The episode, she meant. They didn't happen so frequently that anyone could ever give a good explanation, though Elle tried. My last one had been months ago.{&1310}\par I shrugged my shoulders. I could never really remember afterwards.{&1310}\par "Was Dr. Holloway talking?"{&1310}\par "I guess so."{&1310}\par "About what?"{&1310}\par Again, I shrugged. I'd heard most of it all before over the course of seven semesters. He only spiced a few details up in his lectures, so I mostly spaced out a lot of the time. Sometimes I imagined levitating one of those practice balls and tossing it right at his balding head.{&1310}\par "I don't know. Maybe something about ... subspace particles, I think?"{&1310}\par "Subspace ... \i particles\i0  ..."{&1310}\par She looked at me, hard. {&1310}\par "That's the best you could come up with? Really?"{&1310}\par And sighed, looking down at her pad.{&1310}\par "I'm beginning to see why Dr. Holloway gets so frustrated with you."{&1310}\par "He \i hates\i0  me because I can't \i do\i0  anything," I threw back at her.{&1310}\par "Maybe you're not trying hard enough."{&1310}\par "I am! I've tried everything he's told me to do! I've taken the course seven times! Nothing works!"{&1310}\par She opened her mouth, but I shut her down quickly.{&1310}\par "Dad just keeps making me go because he wants me to prove I can do \i something \i0 ...\i  \i0 Anything! {&1310}\par "Because the alternative would be ...?" she offered.{&1310}\par "That I'm just mundane."{&1310}\par "And you think he's afraid of that being true?"{&1310}\par And there it was.{&1310}\par "Yes."{&1310}\par "Hm."{&1310}\par Elle sat there for a while with her fists balled under her chin and a thoughtful look on her face. I had opened my eyes again, giving her a tired, irritated stare. It was obvious to me - the whole thing, that is. Maybe dad didn't even realize it. He certainly never would have admitted it to me, that's for sure.{&1310}\par Eventually, Elle came out of that introspection and gently dipped her clasped fingers in my direction.{&1310}\par "Maybe he has a different reason for putting you through all that," she ventured, drawing the words out slowly and with some weight. I just shook my head.{&1310}\par My watch beeped.{&1310}\par "Time's up," I sighed wearily at that. "Anything else?"{&1310}\par "Do you have anything else for \i me\i0 , Evelyn," she countered with a genuine smile.{&1310}\par "No. I don't think so."{&1310}\par "What about things with ..."{&1310}\par I felt my face flush hard before she could even finish the sentence. And I stomped all over it before she could.{&1310}\par "Nope. Nothing new."{&1310}\par "Hmm," she mused. "Well, alright then. You are free to go," she joked at my expense.{&1310}\par I got up, said my thank you's and goodbyes, and left.\cf2\highlight0\f2 {&1310}\par }{&1310}

Once. Walking opposite me across the causeway. There were too many people between us, though. Scholars poured out of various halls, shuffling arthritic feet toward one of the central mess halls. It was around noon. Lunchtime. And I hadn't eaten since breakfast. But I was too busy for that right now.{&1310}\par I lost sight of him. He vanished like a ghost. I was almost to Bertram's hostel, though, and I gave it up for a moment. I would find him. I had that something else to do real quick.{&1310}\par I stopped outside the fat, old man's front door, though. I think it was the first time I ever got nervous about going in there. Ever. And I took a moment to lean against the bulkheads. All the excitement had me a little drained.{&1310}\par I still managed to push my way inside a minute later. And came up quickly enough. There were a lot of people in the open room that greeted me - monks and scholars who apparently thought something of Bertram's cooking. It \i was\i0  probably better than in the mess. But it wasn't much good for me.{&1310}\par That lump in my pocket didn't feel very well hidden under my jacket. It felt like everyone in the whole room could see it. A bunch of heads turned on me when I entered, and I froze up. For what must have been the longest moment in my life I stood there, stuck like pins held my back tight to the door behind. Then it passed. They looked away, not very interested at all. And I could breathe again.{&1310}\par "Well hello there, Evelyn!"{&1310}\par I jumped again. This time it was at Bertram's pudgy face suddenly sticking out of the kitchen and shouting at me from across the room with a grin. I caught myself, squeezing both eyes shut. Stupid. But my nerves were more than shot. Another few seconds and I even worked up the courtesy to wave back at the old man.{&1310}\par "Come to see your old pal, Bertram, have you?" he grinned on, throwing a food-stained rag over one aproned shoulder as I made my way uneasily across the room. "Well, you know I charge a hundred bancors for the first time, but the second time is free."{&1310}\par That caught me up for a second. And I breathed a laugh when I started up again and came up to him outside the kitchen. He could get something out of me even at the worst of time. I think he enjoyed that.{&1310}\par He must have noticed, though, because he shook his head ruefully at me next.{&1310}\par "Just have a little bit of fun with you, young lady," he smiled just the same. "Those monks might be walking around with sticks up their asses, but you and Tess are better than that. Nolan did right by you, and so did I. Now," he clapped his hands together and rubbed them briskly, "what can I do for you?"{&1310}\par I opened my mouth, but he beat me to it.{&1310}\par "Say, you haven't seen that horrible little bitch of a girl of mine, have you?" he broke in without missing a beat. "She skipped out on me again and hasn't been back all \i day\i0 ."{&1310}\par I clapped my mouth shut. Thought about it. And shook my head.{&1310}\par He gave me a long, skeptical look. But that was it.{&1310}\par "You look tired, Eve," he said then. "You fall asleep again during lessons? Speaking of that, what are you doing here? Shouldn't you be studying? You just \i wait\i0  until I tell your father you snuck off to visit old Bertram, he'll have you so deep in books all day, you won't see straight for a week!"{&1310}\par "Bertram."{&1310}\par "Oh, right. Where are my manners? Come on in, Evelyn."{&1310}\par Never mind that I was already in. He waved me into the kitchen and scurried off just the same. Someone shouted after from the bar, but he just threw a pudgy arm back with a dismissive grunt.{&1310}\par {&1310}\par Someone came hopping lackadaisically down the back steps, and I looked to see who it was. A now infamous mop of rosy-pink hair flopped around as whoever it was leapt the last few feet, muted music blaring loud about her head. Then that someone came up short, gaping at both of us.{&1310}\par "Eve!" Tess blurted out in surprise, tearing her earphones out with a hand. Her own undoing.{&1310}\par "What are you doing here? Shouldn't you be-"{&1310}\par "\i Hey\i0 !" Bertram twisted his fat mass around in the chair in an instant. He barked so loud the other woman fell back a step.  "What the hell do you think you're doing, girl?"{&1310}\par "Uh ..."{&1310}\par But the old man was already bounding back to his feet.{&1310}\par "I may not be your father but that don't mean I won't beat your scrawny ass 'til it bleeds! Get over here!"{&1310}\par Tess didn't, though. She spun right around and bolted for the back door, slapping the control and scurrying through. Bertram trudged a few steps after, but there no use for it. She was already gone. So he just shook a fat fist after her and shouted down the hall.{&1310}\par He let out a long sigh, out of breath, when he finally came back. The chair groaned under him again as he leaned back hard.{&1310}\par "Damn me, but I love that girl," he lamented wistfully for a moment. "Don't know what I'll do when she finally gets it in her head to leave. Not like you, Eve," he shook his head at me. "If Nolan had never gotten around to dragging you off you would of grown old and fat here like me." He slapped his stomach so it bounced.{&1310}\par I must have winced, because he laughed. He reached across the counter and slapped my shoulder too.{&1310}\par "Just playing with you, girl!" he grinned with all his teeth. And settled back again. "Neither of you two were meant to stay here this long. Just luck that your time came first."\cf2\f2 {&1310}\par }{&1310}
