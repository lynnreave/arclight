Just a heavy orange-yellow glow as they billowed out like steam from a covered pot.

Flames whipped off it and scorched the tops of trees above me, filling the air all around me with a shrill screaming whine that drowned out everything else. It roared just overhead, and I sucked in 'til my lungs were bursting, wide-eyed before it passed. It shrieked off somewhere else and plunged into the forest.

The sun poured in without me blocking its way. And suddenly those dark smudges all over the place weren't just shadows' play on the inside. It was blood.{&1310}\par I reeled. Everything started to recede from outside me, like the blood was seeping its way back in close to the heart. First slow. Then faster and faster. I drowned in a whitewash of white noise and, the next thing I knew, I was on the ground in the dirt.{&1310}\par Things started to slowly push back out from where they were trapped inside my skull.

I shook my head so hard it almost came off. I started to wish it would.{&1310}\par No.{&1310}\par They had gotten out of there. I was already been too late. I must have been. They were free and out and already making their way through the forest back to somewhere safe.{&1310}\par I clawed my way back up to my feet.{&1310}\par I scrounged around the pod, desperate for any tracks.

I made five runs around the steaming pod and cinders of fallen trees and ... nothing.{&1310}\par Giving up might have started to seem pretty good right about then. Maybe to someone else. Anyone else.

Eventually. {&1310}\par I was grasping at straws and fading hopes when I reached the edge of the clearing, arms wrapped tight around me to ward of the inevitable realization and hopelessness.

There were no other tracks around it. They just started up there, a dozen meters away from the pod, and tore away into the woods. Nothing like shoeprints anyways.{&1310}\par I looked up that way, gradually. And it made the hairs on the back of my neck perk up. For a while, all I could do was stare into those shadows hidden away from the blinding sun beneath the trees. And breathe.{&1310}\par It got real quiet. All I could hear was myself and that emptiness between me in the whitewashed clearing and that darkness that managed to find somewhere to hide beneath that light. Then something else abruptly broke the silence from behind.{&1310}\par Thunder cracked loud in the clouds above some distance off. No rain, though, or lightning. Just a heavy orange-yellow glow as they billowed out like steam from a covered pot. It blocked out the sun, stretching a long shadow down across the forest and the ground until it swallowed all three of us.{&1310}\par I looked up, forgeting to close my mouth. Somehow, I didn't think that was normal. Not with the way those clouds were boiling and rolling over like that. What did I know, though? And before I could wonder what the hell was even going on, they sudden belched up a flaming ball of molten metal with another thunderous clap that knocked me flat to the ground.{&1310}\par I got a good view of that thing howling out of that hole in the sky then, as it flashed down toward the ground. Flames whipped off it and scorched the tops of trees above me, filling the air all around me with a shrill screaming whine that drowned out everything else. It roared just overhead, and I sucked in 'til my lungs were bursting, wide-eyed before it passed. It shrieked off somewhere else and plunged into the forest. I felt the ground rattle underneath me.{&1310}\par When it was all over, I just lay there for a few seconds, swallowing hard.
