"What do you mean?"{&1310}\par Those crystalline blue eyes caught the light and glinted like ice when I twisted back around to look at him. Hard and cold beneath his white brow, the skin around drawn tight and wrinkled. He had been an old man for more than twenty years. And never got tired of reminding me of that. Still, twenty-some years. And still, I couldn't meet that gaze for long.\b {&1310}\par \b0 It was how he kept questions at bay. He hated explaining himself. Especially to me.

Then abruptly rushed forward.{&1310}\par "It's time to leave."{&1310}\par He had almost made it to the door before I got my mouth back shut. I just stared for a few, long moments. Stared at him.
