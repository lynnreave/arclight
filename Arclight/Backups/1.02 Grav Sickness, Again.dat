It was bad enough that Lieutenant Morisant always tried to play it down like an excuse and medical could never find anything wrong with me. "Chief."{&1310}\par A corpsman had already checked me over in the field before they shipped me back, but I barely remembered it. My brain had felt like it was swimming inside my skull trying to get out, and I didn't like remembering that feeling. Field bio-scanners couldn't figure out what was wrong, though. They never could. It was why Morisant always thought I was just trying to cause problems for him. Like I wanted any more of his attention than I already got - which was a \i lot\i0 .{&1310}\par The chief pushed a finger to his temple. "Dynamo, get me something for grav-sickness in here, please." He said aloud to the air.{&1310}\par We were stuck in the back of the tiny sick bay of the command ship for that week's training exercises. I was the only one in there and the rest of the ship was mostly empty since all the other cadets were down on the rock. Just a skeleton crew with a small command staff watching over things on the bridge. I'd been in this spot plenty of times before, and there was nothing like being stuck alone with a bunch of senior enlisted and officers to make a first-year cadet feel like even more of a nobody.{&1310}\par "It's \i not\i0  grav-sickness, Chief," I tried to tell him, fighting for that small recognition. He just smiled back at me.{&1310}\par "How's the implant?"{&1310}\par I groaned. "Still ... off. I think. I guess. I don't know." I shook my head.{&1310}\par They'd had to disable it almost as soon as they'd stuffed it inside my head. I never even knew by the time I woke up - days later. It was kind of uncommon for people not to have \i some\i0  complications. Mine, though, had apparently been really bad.{&1310}\par "What's that, cadet?"{&1310}\par "I said I don't really know."{&1310}\par "Hm. That's when these headaches started, though. Right? I think I remember something about that in your file."{&1310}\par "Yeah. I guess so." They were supposed to remove it too. Eventually. It was bad enough I hadn't had any say in it getting shoved in there in the first place.{&1310}\par He gave me a mildly amused look. "Better not let your unit commander hear you talk to any of the service members like that." To which I had to repress the urge to roll my eyes.{&1310}\par "Sorry, Chief," I corrected myself. "I meant: 'Aye, Chief'."{&1310}\par "Well, your scans didn't show anything," he sighed. "So, you can get up out of that- woah, wait a minute ..."{&1310}\par He'd been about to turn away from his readouts when something caught his eye. He snapped back around and promptly forgot about the cadet lying on his examination table.{&1310}\par I almost jumped right out of it.{&1310}\par "What? What is it? Did you see something?"{&1310}\par He frowned, tapping a few holographic buttons in mid-air. A spinning image of my skull blew up in front of him. He grabbed it with both hands before panning it around.{&1310}\par "I thought I saw something," he finally said, still distracted with it. Then started shaking his head. "Maybe a spot of interference in the lenses. Looks fine now."{&1310}\par "Are you sure?" I pushed my way up from the table and the live view of my head flickered and died in his hands. The chief sighed and gave me a look.{&1310}\par "Not anymore I'm not."{&1310}\par "Oh."{&1310}\par "I'll have Dynamo take a look at it later and see if I missed anything." {&1310}\par "Sorry, Chief."{&1310}\par The door breathed open behind us and the robotic med-tech rolled in as if on cue. Holloway took an applicator from him.{&1310}\par "Hopefully, this will help alleviate the symptoms. Reactions to transit pressures are common, despite the pods. Especially on drops."{&1310}\par "It's not grav-sickness," I repeated, sagging back down against the table and looking away.{&1310}\par "Humor me."{&1310}\par I felt a pressure against the vein in my arm. I tried to think about other things, but I just kept coming back around to that dream and how real it had felt. Just like the others. I wondered when they were going to stop.{&1310}\par "You'll have to stay aboard until the rest of your unit gets back from exercises," he said with too much bedside manner. {&1310}\par "That's not until the end of the week!"{&1310}\par He shrugged. "Not much I can do there, cadet. You might be medically sound as far as I can tell, but they're already underway and I won't be able to release you until well after they've left safe drop ranges. You know Lieutenant Morisant won't make an exception in your case."{&1310}\par No. He wouldn't.{&1310}\par He stood up to a whirr of biomechanisms from his artificial leg. Even through his service trousers, you still knew it was there by the sound of it. The newer models weren't supposed to be quite so loud.{&1310}\par "Should've waited a little longer to get that headache," he said with another smile for me. It wasn't forced or condescending like some of the other service members. Just indifferent. Another cadet with another problem.

Again?" {&1310}\par Chief Petty Officer Holloway's chair slipped away from the examination table back toward his readouts. He laughed a little, but he had a thoughtful look on his face. {&1310}\par "Seems like you're always in here during field exercises with headaches, Weir. If I didn't know any better, I'd say that you were-"{&1310}\par "\i Severe \i0 headaches," I corrected him quickly. I had to pull back from sounding too edgy with an effort. It was bad enough that Lieutenant Morisant always tried to play it down like an excuse and medical could never find anything wrong with me. "Chief."{&1310}\par A corpsman had already checked me over in the field before they shipped me back, but I barely remembered it. My brain had felt like it was swimming inside my skull trying to get out, and I didn't like remembering that feeling. Field bio-scanners couldn't figure out what was wrong, though. They never could. It was why Morisant always thought I was just trying to cause problems for him. Like I wanted any more of his attention than I already got - which was a \i lot\i0 .{&1310}\par The chief pushed a finger to his temple. "Dynamo, get me something for grav-sickness in here, please." He said aloud to the air.{&1310}\par We were stuck in the back of the tiny sick bay of the command ship for that week's training exercises. I was the only one in there and the rest of the ship was mostly empty since all the other cadets were down on the rock. Just a skeleton crew with a small command staff watching over things on the bridge. I'd been in this spot plenty of times before, and there was nothing like being stuck alone with a bunch of senior enlisted and officers to make a first-year cadet feel like even more of a nobody.{&1310}\par "It's \i not\i0  grav-sickness, Chief," I tried to tell him, fighting for that small recognition. He just smiled back at me.{&1310}\par "How's the implant?"{&1310}\par I groaned. "Still ... off. I think. I guess. I don't know." I shook my head.{&1310}\par They'd had to disable it almost as soon as they'd stuffed it inside my head. I never even knew by the time I woke up - days later. It was kind of uncommon for people not to have \i some\i0  complications. Mine, though, had apparently been really bad.{&1310}\par "What's that, cadet?"{&1310}\par "I said I don't really know."{&1310}\par "Hm. That's when these headaches started, though. Right? I think I remember something about that in your file."{&1310}\par "Yeah. I guess so." They were supposed to remove it too. Eventually. It was bad enough I hadn't had any say in it getting shoved in there in the first place.{&1310}\par He gave me a mildly amused look. "Better not let your unit commander hear you talk to any of the service members like that." To which I had to repress the urge to roll my eyes.{&1310}\par "Sorry, Chief," I corrected myself. "I meant: 'Aye, Chief'."{&1310}\par "Well, your scans didn't show anything," he sighed. "So, you can get up out of that- woah, wait a minute ..."{&1310}\par He'd been about to turn away from his readouts when something caught his eye. He snapped back around and promptly forgot about the cadet lying on his examination table.{&1310}\par I almost jumped right out of it.{&1310}\par "What? What is it? Did you see something?"{&1310}\par He frowned, tapping a few holographic buttons in mid-air. A spinning image of my skull blew up in front of him. He grabbed it with both hands before panning it around.{&1310}\par "I thought I saw something," he finally said, still distracted with it. Then started shaking his head. "Maybe a spot of interference in the lenses. Looks fine now."{&1310}\par "Are you sure?" I pushed my way up from the table and the live view of my head flickered and died in his hands. The chief sighed and gave me a look.{&1310}\par "Not anymore I'm not."{&1310}\par "Oh."{&1310}\par "I'll have Dynamo take a look at it later and see if I missed anything." {&1310}\par "Sorry, Chief."{&1310}\par The door breathed open behind us and the robotic med-tech rolled in as if on cue. Holloway took an applicator from him.{&1310}\par "Hopefully, this will help alleviate the symptoms. Reactions to transit pressures are common, despite the pods. Especially on drops."{&1310}\par "It's not grav-sickness," I repeated, sagging back down against the table and looking away.{&1310}\par "Humor me."{&1310}\par I felt a pressure against the vein in my arm.
