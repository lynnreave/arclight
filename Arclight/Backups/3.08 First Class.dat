He had been looking the other way and only gave the screams a passing glance.{&1310}\par "I don't know, but you'd better forget about them if you want to stay alive."{&1310}\par That threw Tess again. Like him executing that man back there had. Her face froze again in that distraught, horrified expression for a few seconds before she could open her mouth. And when she did, it was like she hadn't even heard a word he said - her brain had just reset.{&1310}\par "How did it \i get\i0  here?"{&1310}\par "What do you want us to do?" I broke in instead.{&1310}\par "We have to get back to that train."{&1310}\par "We have to do something!" Tess wailed at him, stabbing a hand back at the town. "We can't just ... just ..."{&1310}\par His brow lowered, and those flint-like eyes leveled on her. They clamped her mouth shut.{&1310}\par "Come on," Julian growled, grabbing her bodily. She was too stunned to struggle. He just gave me a look and I fell in behind.{&1310}\par We spent the rest of that night in one of the cars of the train.{&1310}\par I'd never seen a locomotive before in person. The real thing was somehow more impressive than I imagined and less than I thought it should be. Neither Tess nor me got too excited about that idle metal behemoth hovering suspended from the ground in a near-frictionless state, though. Julian said it was a light freight model, built for carrying tons of cargo. Thick, durable, titanium alloys. Tess just pulled out her pad and tried to get a door open despite her numb, shaky fingers.{&1310}\par My skin crawled all over while we waited. I felt like that thing would come hurtling out of the darkness at us at any moment while she did, and I tried to put my back to the steel monster with Julian between me and the dark of night. We heard screams. Heart-wrenching screams from the town, as people died. Too bad most of us were far too gone to notice, or care.{&1310}\par Tess did eventually manage to get the thing open, and we never saw anything more of that thing before we got inside. Julian locked us in one of the front cars that managed to open and we bunkered down for the rest of the night to the muted sounds of death outside.{&1310}\par After an hour or two, we just stopped hearing them any more.\cf2\f1 {&1310}\par }{&1310}
