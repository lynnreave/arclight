My old home. She was giving me a judgmental look out of the corner of her eye as we walked. "Did they even let you sleep on that ship?"{&1310}\par "Eight hours everyday. But I had to spend at least half of them getting ready for the next day, so ... No, not really."{&1310}\par God that was true, and it was terrible now that I thought about it being sort of behind me. They always said you had enough time to get all the sleep you needed but that was BS. They'd give you too much crap to do before the next day for you to get more than three or four hours of sleep at best.{&1310}\par "Yeah, and that new murder-only diet isn't doing much for your face either. You look fucking horrible, so I guess you didn't get a second look from any of those eager, young cadets, huh?"{&1310}\par "Nope. But at least I got to give them all the second looks \i I\i0  felt like," I told her, straight-faced. "Especially in those unisex showers."{&1310}\par "You are such a \i fucking \i0 liar!"{&1310}\par And I got to laugh at that sudden mix of snarky attitude and red-faced gall from being outmaneuvered by me on her face.{&1310}\par "Anyways -- if they were half as hideous as the guys I watched come off that ship with you, I wasn't missing anything. Better off getting eyeballed by an officer with old balls and a pedigree here than some testosterone-junkie barely out of puberty, I guess."{&1310}\par "I think you were the only reason Bertram's was so popular."{&1310}\par "Well my dad wasn't a retired admiral in the Navy, so ... And what do you mean '\i were\i0 '? I still am, bitch. Way to not call me back, by the way. You have \i no\i0  idea how boring it's been here since you left. I swear I never thought messing with these asshat labcoats and their freaky military experiments would ever get boring but holy hell it kinda did. You'd think more of them wouldn't be just plain, well ... \i stupid\i0 ."{&1310}\par She waggled her fingers in the air and threw her voice sarcastically when she said "freaky" so suddenly that I started laughing again. It gave her a chance to snag a cigarette out of her coat inside pocket and light up there while we walked.{&1310}\par "So," she mumbled around the stem, and then puffed out a lungful of smoke to one side, "anything interesting happen that you couldn't tell me while you were being monitored?"{&1310}\par "Who says I'm not being monitored right \i now\i0 ?"{&1310}\par "\i Shut \i0 up." She shook her head, not believing that for a second. And then again, "Anything?"{&1310}\par I thought about it, but there wasn't really all that much that came to mind. I ended up sighing and shrugging instead. {&1310}\par "It really all just kind of ... sucked."{&1310}\par "Oh, come on. Really? "{&1310}\par "Yeah. It really did."{&1310}\par "How long'd it take you to figure that out? I told you it was a fucking horrible idea back when you still had a chance to back out."{&1310}\par She puffed and gave me a look full of chagrine out of the corner of her eye. I just shrugged again.{&1310}\par "I guess you should've listened to your BFF instead of old \i Weir\i0 do, huh? Yeah? You remember that for next time."{&1310}\par The Academy was all dad's idea in the first place, not that I'd ever told her that. She'd thought it was mine, and he'd just been really supportive and excited about the whole thing. Oh, he'd never said anything directly at first, but I had picked up on the hints. He probably thought they'd been subtle, but he was getting old now and I'd caught onto him a long time ago. Not that I'd ever tell him that either, though.{&1310}\par "I know, I know," Tess waved both hands in front of her as we slipped down one of the side alleys from the main causeway -- a shortcut to my old apartment with dad, "following in his footsteps or something like that, but -- come on. He barely even let you go to public class with all the other military brats on station."{&1310}\par She gave me this exasperated look that only she could manage with me. Bertram had made her to go public schooling her whole life and she always gave me shit about being "protected" from it by dad. She might have even resented me a little bit for it, but she never let that really show. Either way, she brought it up now and couldn't help poking fun at me and everything we did as kids all the way back to my old home, laughing it up about anything and everything we could remember before I'd disappeared away to some hellhole out of her life for six whole months.{&1310}\par {&1310}\par \pard\sl480\slmult1\qc\f1\fs20 *\tab *\tab *\f0\fs22 {&1310}\par \pard\fi720\sl480\slmult1\cf2\f2 {&1310}\par \cf1\f0 That moment stuck in my head of a sudden as I followed that trail of blood up and over the dead readout consoles into the lab. There had been a viewport there that must have been regular glass and not steelglass because it was shattered like whoever it was bleeding all over the place had broken right through it. {&1310}\par Other memories tried to swirl up and around inside my skull but they were jumbled, nonsensical images that made my forehead start throbbing. I put the heel of my hand to it before I remembered the slimy blood still caked there. Then it was suddenly impossible not to dry heave at the floor.{&1310}\par The smell. I'd never smelled so much blood in one place before. I'd seen plenty of cadets bleed during training -- I'm pretty sure they wouldn't have let you graduate without getting some minimum amount of blood punched right out of you by the instructors -- but not like this. It was like someone had been sliced open and dragged across the open deck.{&1310}\par Why? Just ... \i why\i0 ?{&1310}\par Why would anyone do that?{&1310}\par I didn't want to look in there. There wasn't going to be anyone alive, that's for sure. Not with all the blood they'd left behind. And if they were ...{&1310}\par I didn't want to look in there.{&1310}\par But I did.{&1310}\par And there was nothing.{&1310}\par It must have taken me a couple minutes of just standing there, breathing short, shallow breaths in the dark before I forced myself to step forward and look. My boots clopped on the floor a few steps and I was gazing over inside. I followed the trail all the way in to where it finally just pooled and disappeared there. No body. Nothing even inside the lab. It looked like it had been completely empty and unused before someone had gone up and died in the middle of it. Except they weren't there anymore.{&1310}\par Where was the bleeder?{&1310}\par I looked around in the dark. The emergency lights really didn't help for shit. Maybe they'd taken him away? That made sense if someone had been wounded in some kind of accident and they suddenly had to evacuate the level. The \i whole\i0  level, though? I guess I couldn't know without checking the whole place but ... the silence was eerie. You'd think ghosts would stick to planets and the colonies. Terrestrial places. There was too much metal and technology here for that superstitious crap. But no. Somehow that whole place I'd grown up and spent my entire life in just suddenly felt dead and empty and haunted all around me.{&1310}\par It was just this deck. I \i had \i0 to get off this deck. There would still be people on the other decks. Right?{&1310}\par Something caught my eye on the floor and I found a relatively bloodless spot between the jagged shards of broken glass still sticking up from the port hole to lean up on and get a closer look inside. I could have just used the door but ... there was no fucking way I was going in there. So I stuck my head closer, trying to see, and saw it. A mark on the floor.{&1310}\par It was in the blood. I was pretty sure of that. And -- I couldn't be sure without getting in there and looking closer but -- I think it was part of a footprint. A bootheel of blood. I didn't bother trying to go inside and look. I just crouched down next to the door and looked for any more.{&1310}\par I found them. Smears of liquid against the deck that the low light turned black. I had a sudden image in my head of a half-dead man getting up out of that pool of his own blood and staggering out into the hallway. How could someone who'd lost that much blood even do that? Too many horror vids stuck in the back of my head were telling me zombie. Is that what had happened? Some weird experiment up here finally went wrong and caused a contagion outbreak? What about me? Oh my god was I infected now?{&1310}\par No. They had biocontamination mechanisms in place for that. I know they did. {&1310}\par But what if they failed?{&1310}\par Wait. No.{&1310}\par This was a psychokinetics research deck. The biotics facilities had the bigger, reinforced  labs that none of that shit could get out of if things went wrong. And they didn't have a post on the wall indicating "PK Labs 81-120" on the bulkhead.{&1310}\par It was just above my head when I stood back up, barely legible there in the dark. But these were psychokinetics labs -- \i not\i0  biotics. So that threw that whole insanely fictional worry right out the airlock.{&1310}\par But there was a creeping certainty in the back of my head that I couldn't get rid of so easily. I was trying to ignore it as hard as I could. I didn't want to think about it. \i Couldn't\i0  think about it. But those memory-like dreams were too vivid and lodged inside like an infection of their own. All I could see was that alien world through Sergeant Brennan's eyes when I tried to squeeze my own shut.{&1310}\par The urge to just sit there, plant myself firmly in a corner and tighten up into a ball waiting for someone -- \i anyone\i0  -- to come and help me, tell me what the hell had happened to everyone else and left me here all alone in the dark, was overwhelming. Training won out, though. Training and all those horror vids me and Tess used to watch growing up. I wasn't going to die here and no one was going to come save \i me\i0 .{&1310}\par Nothing had changed. I had to get off this deck. I had to find \i someone\i0 . {&1310}\par I got up to follow those bloody footprints. Not because I wanted to -- following obviously terrible clues like that was how the dumb people always got killed in the vids -- Because I \i had\i0  to. I had a feeling they would lead me to a way off that deck and I was right.{&1310}\par I found the lifts, but the lifts were dead just like everything else. Those smudges of blood from some half-dead guy's feet led that way. As I'd followed them the image of someone else picking him up by one shoulder and helping him limp and shuffle his way toward escape popped into my head. Didn't that make more sense? More sense than zombies or monsters, I guess. Maybe I was imagining how terrible that much blood really was because there was just so much of it on the floor. {&1310}\par It was a comforting thought because I started to calm down. The shadows seemed less thick and stifling, more empty and unthreatening. This wasn't some horrible experiment gone wrong or some kind of attack -- it was just some terrible accident, and they'd had to evacuate this level. That's all.{&1310}\par See? And that wasn't so hard to get under control, was it?{&1310}\par But ... why did they leave \i me\i0 ?{&1310}\par \i Maybe they didn't\i0 .{&1310}\par I don't know where that thought came from but it was weird, and I couldn't shake it as I looked around wondering how the hell I was going to get off this level when the lifts were down. This time, thankfully, without so much of that harried panic that'd followed me out of the lab and down the halls. I got a little frustrated staring at those closed lift doors instead.{&1310}\par Well? What now?{&1310}\par If I'd had anything on me but a busted comm and some casual civvies I might have been able to do something. That got me checking any pockets I had in a rush. {&1310}\par "What ..."{&1310}\par Something in the butt pocket of my jeans slipped out of my hand when I tried to pull it out. That slick, oozy feel of old blood I could almost forget about but not really. Whatever it was, it clattered to the floor and I doubled over after it without thinking. Like that little sound would suddenly wake up the angry dead in these empty halls with too much noise.{&1310}\par "... the hell?"{&1310}\par I picked the thing back up and twisted it around in my fingers, trying to get a better look. Some kind of datachip, I thought, but it was hard to tell in the dark. Probably just something Tess had given me or I'd picked up after getting back home. I slipped it back inside that pocket, but there was nothing else.{&1310}\par So prying the door open with my fingers was what I was left with, and that didn't work out too well. I struggled with each of the doors for a few seconds, trying to peel it back with just my fingertips, before moving onto the next. I lost my grip on one and ended up falling over into the wall, and I almost didn't bother with the last lift -- which was the one I ended up getting open. Not that it mattered that much in the end. {&1310}\par I yanked away until the powered-down lift door was open, but there was only empty space inside. No lift. I wondered if \i that\i0  would have mattered either. What was I going to do with a dead box of steel that wouldn't go anywhere? I don't know. It's not like I knew how to hotwire something like that or anything. Or had any power source to get it moving even if I did.{&1310}\par There were support braces, rivets, and tons of mechanisms that would've been whirring about along the sides of the tube the lift moved through to get to the other decks of the station, but I couldn't climb them. Even powered down and safe, I couldn't climb them. The bulkhead sealed just a little ways down between this deck and the next and I was pretty sure that was some kind of security lockdown against potential hull breaches.{&1310}\par "Well ... \i shit\i0 !"{&1310}\par Panic again. Frustrated panic.{&1310}\par What the hell was I going to do now? The bulkheads being sealed between decks couldn't have been a good sign. It probably meant I couldn't even get off this fucking deck at all!{&1310}\par I slumped back against the wall, wringing my hands back through my hair. I forgot the blood on one of them.{&1310}\par \i What the hell am I supposed to do\i0 ?{&1310}\par I couldn't just die in here. I couldn't. Right?{&1310}\par The thought of that started freaking me out on a whole new level that I could barely even comprehend.{&1310}\par \i Don't think about it. Don't think about it.\i0 {&1310}\par Wait.{&1310}\par I stopped clawing at my scalp and looked up.{&1310}\par There were emergency access tubes, right? For the maintenance guys? Christ, there \i had\i0  to be.{&1310}\par Yes! I'd overheard people working down for Chief Fitzpatrick talking about climbing in there -- the "bowels" or "arteries" of the station or something cute and stupid like that. I'd just never really cared or paid much attention to them before, and certainly never climbed inside myself. And they tried to teach you to pay attention to \i everything\i0  in a life or death situation at the Academy.{&1310}\par I got up and started scrambling around along the walls near the lifts -- I just guessed they might be there, but who knew, it was a place to start at least -- and started chasing that down like a lifeline. It probably was. I'd die in here otherwise, I was sure of it. Chances are the environmental systems wouldn't be giving me any fresh air and I'd die slowly of carbon dioxide poisoning. And if it wasn't that -- dehydration. How did I know anyone would ever even come for me? What if no one was even left alive?{&1310}\par \i Don't think about that\i0 .{&1310}\par Shit. Right. It's not helping.{&1310}\par That hope and that task kept me occupied enough again not to just lose it. I suppose training at the Academy helped a little too, even though I'd never really thought about getting stuck in a situation that might kill me while I was there. You just \i didn't\i0 , not really. I don't care what anybody said. {&1310}\par I spent what felt like hours pawing along the bulkheads for anything that might have been an access hatch to what I was imagining were a complicated, interlacing network that ran throughout the entire station. I knew they were. They had to be. And one of them had to lead to the next deck.{&1310}\par The emergency lighting didn't help. Who designed those things anyways? I could understand why they barely used anything but shenlizite fuel cells for everything else. This backup lighting sucked and I almost didn't realize it when I finally came across exactly what I was looking for.{&1310}\par I felt for the release after I barely missed what the thing was with my searching hands entirely. Just a bit of the bulkhead sticking out but still all but seamless and smooth. I crouched down, squinted to get a good look, and immediately tugged on that release. {&1310}\par Considering everything else around here, I'd half-expected the thing to make me fight it open. I guess it must have been mechanical, and that made sense if it was supposed to be used in emergencies. This was \i definitely\i0  an emergency too, so I ignored the warning and threw it open.{&1310}\par I was ready for the dark, and the claustrophobic insides. I hadn't thought much about it but I was definitely prepared to claw my way through there if it meant getting off this haunted level and down to the next deck without being left to rot. What I wasn't ready for, though, was the body I found inside.\cf2\f2 {&1310}\par }{&1310}

Maybe I was imagining how terrible that much blood really was because there was just so much of it on the floor. {&1310}\par It was a comforting thought because I started to calm down. The shadows seemed less thick and stifling, more empty and unthreatening. This wasn't some horrible experiment gone wrong or some kind of attack -- it was just some terrible accident, and they'd had to evacuate this level. That's all.{&1310}\par See? And that wasn't so hard to get under control, was it?{&1310}\par But ... why did they leave \i me\i0 ?{&1310}\par \i Maybe they didn't\i0 .{&1310}\par I don't know where that thought came from but it was weird, and I couldn't shake it as I looked around wondering how the hell I was going to get off this level when the lifts were down. This time, thankfully, without so much of that harried panic that'd followed me out of the lab and down the halls. I got a little frustrated staring at those closed lift doors instead.{&1310}\par Well? What now?{&1310}\par If I'd had anything on me but a busted comm and some casual civvies I might have been able to do something. That got me checking any pockets I had in a rush. {&1310}\par "What ..."{&1310}\par Something in the butt pocket of my jeans slipped out of my hand when I tried to pull it out. That slick, oozy feel of old blood I could almost forget about but not really. Whatever it was, it clattered to the floor and I doubled over after it without thinking. Like that little sound would suddenly wake up the angry dead in these empty halls with too much noise.{&1310}\par "... the hell?"{&1310}\par I picked the thing back up and twisted it around in my fingers, trying to get a better look. Some kind of datachip, I thought, but it was hard to tell in the dark. Probably just something Tess had given me or I'd picked up after getting back home. I slipped it back inside that pocket, but there was nothing else.{&1310}\par So prying the door open with my fingers was what I was left with, and that didn't work out too well. I struggled with each of the doors for a few seconds, trying to peel it back with just my fingertips, before moving onto the next. I lost my grip on one and ended up falling over into the wall, and I almost didn't bother with the last lift -- which was the one I ended up getting open. Not that it mattered that much in the end. {&1310}\par I yanked away until the powered-down lift door was open, but there was only empty space inside. No lift. I wondered if \i that\i0  would have mattered either. What was I going to do with a dead box of steel that wouldn't go anywhere? I don't know. It's not like I knew how to hotwire something like that or anything. Or had any power source to get it moving even if I did.{&1310}\par There were support braces, rivets, and tons of mechanisms that would've been whirring about along the sides of the tube the lift moved through to get to the other decks of the station, but I couldn't climb them. Even powered down and safe, I couldn't climb them. The bulkhead sealed just a little ways down between this deck and the next and I was pretty sure that was some kind of security lockdown against potential hull breaches.{&1310}\par "Well ... \i shit\i0 !"{&1310}\par Panic again. Frustrated panic.{&1310}\par What the hell was I going to do now? The bulkheads being sealed between decks couldn't have been a good sign. It probably meant I couldn't even get off this fucking deck at all!{&1310}\par I slumped back against the wall, wringing my hands back through my hair. I forgot the blood on one of them.{&1310}\par \i What the hell am I supposed to do\i0 ?{&1310}\par I couldn't just die in here. I couldn't. Right?{&1310}\par The thought of that started freaking me out on a whole new level that I could barely even comprehend.{&1310}\par \i Don't think about it. Don't think about it.\i0 {&1310}\par Wait.{&1310}\par I stopped clawing at my scalp and looked up.{&1310}\par There were emergency access tubes, right? For the maintenance guys? Christ, there \i had\i0  to be.{&1310}\par Yes! I'd overheard people working down for Chief Fitzpatrick talking about climbing in there -- the "bowels" or "arteries" of the station or something cute and stupid like that. I'd just never really cared or paid much attention to them before, and certainly never climbed inside myself. And they tried to teach you to pay attention to \i everything\i0  in a life or death situation at the Academy.{&1310}\par I got up and started scrambling around along the walls near the lifts -- I just guessed they might be there, but who knew, it was a place to start at least -- and started chasing that down like a lifeline. It probably was. I'd die in here otherwise, I was sure of it. Chances are the environmental systems wouldn't be giving me any fresh air and I'd die slowly of carbon dioxide poisoning. And if it wasn't that -- dehydration. How did I know anyone would ever even come for me? What if no one was even left alive?{&1310}\par \i Don't think about that\i0 .{&1310}\par Shit. Right. It's not helping.{&1310}\par That hope and that task kept me occupied enough again not to just lose it. I suppose training at the Academy helped a little too, even though I'd never really thought about getting stuck in a situation that might kill me while I was there. You just \i didn't\i0 , not really. I don't care what anybody said. {&1310}\par I spent what felt like hours pawing along the bulkheads for anything that might have been an access hatch to what I was imagining were a complicated, interlacing network that ran throughout the entire station. I knew they were. They had to be. And one of them had to lead to the next deck.{&1310}\par The emergency lighting didn't help. Who designed those things anyways? I could understand why they barely used anything but shenlizite fuel cells for everything else. This backup lighting sucked and I almost didn't realize it when I finally came across exactly what I was looking for.{&1310}\par I felt for the release after I barely missed what the thing was with my searching hands entirely. Just a bit of the bulkhead sticking out but still all but seamless and smooth. I crouched down, squinted to get a good look, and immediately tugged on that release. {&1310}\par Considering everything else around here, I'd half-expected the thing to make me fight it open. I guess it must have been mechanical, and that made sense if it was supposed to be used in emergencies. This was \i definitely\i0  an emergency too, so I ignored the warning and threw it open.{&1310}\par I was ready for the dark, and the claustrophobic insides. I hadn't thought much about it but I was definitely prepared to claw my way through there if it meant getting off this haunted level and down to the next deck without being left to rot. What I wasn't ready for, though, was the body I found inside.\cf2\f2 {&1310}\par }{&1310}

My old home. "You have \i no\i0  idea how terrible it's been here without you around. I swear I never thought messing with these stick-up-their-asses labcoats and their freaky military experiments would ever get boring but holy hell it kinda did. You'd think more of them wouldn't be just plain, well ... \i stupid\i0 ."{&1310}\par I snorted, and shook my head. "It really all just kind of ... sucked."{&1310}\par "Oh, come on!"{&1310}\par "No. Really."{&1310}\par "Don't lie to me."{&1310}\par "I'm not!"{&1310}\par "That sucks. You were so excited to go," she blew out a heavy sigh, forcing the pink tendrils of hair hanging over the sides of her face to flop over and out of the way for a second. "Even old \i Weir\i0 do seemed like he liked the idea for some reason."{&1310}\par Yeah, but I'd never told her it was dad's in the first place, so of course he had in his own little, close-lipped and quiet sort of way. Oh, he never said anything directly, but I had picked up on the hints. He probably thought they'd been subtle, but he was getting old now and I'd caught onto him a long time ago. Not that I'd ever tell him that either, though.{&1310}\par "I know, I know," Tess waved both hands in front of her as we slipped down one of the side alleys from the main causeway, "following in his footsteps or something like that, but -- come on. He barely even let you go to public class with all the other military brats on station."{&1310}\par She gave me this exasperated look that suddenly made me feel so wonderfully at home again with its familiarity I could have cried. I'd forgotten a lot -- buried in the back of my head to protect it from screaming instructors, near-death fatigue, and twenty-four hour discipline that barely let up even after lights-out. But this -- \i this\i0  was something special and homely and just for me and \i my\i0  life. No one else's.{&1310}\par {&1310}\par \pard\sl480\slmult1\qc\f1\fs20 *\tab *\tab *\f0\fs22 {&1310}\par \pard\fi720\sl480\slmult1\cf2\f2 {&1310}\par \cf1\f0 That moment stuck in my head of a sudden as I followed that trail of blood up and over the dead readout consoles into the lab. There had been a viewport there that must have been regular glass and not steelglass because it was shattered like whoever it was bleeding all over the place had broken right through it. {&1310}\par Other memories tried to swirl up and around inside my skull but they were jumbled, nonsensical images that made my forehead start throbbing. I put the heel of my hand to it before I remembered the slimy blood still caked there. Then it was suddenly impossible not to dry heave at the floor.{&1310}\par The smell. I'd never smelled so much blood in one place before. I'd seen plenty of cadets bleed during training -- I'm pretty sure they wouldn't have let you graduate without getting some minimum of blood punched right out of you by the instructors -- but not like this. It was like someone had been sliced open and dragged across the open deck.{&1310}\par Why? Just ... \i why\i0 ?{&1310}\par Why would anyone do that?{&1310}\par I didn't want to look in there. There wasn't going to be anyone alive, that's for sure. Not with all the blood they'd left behind. And if they were ...{&1310}\par I didn't want to look in there.{&1310}\par But I did.{&1310}\par And there was nothing.{&1310}\par It must have taken me a couple minutes of just standing there, breathing short, shallow breaths in the dark before I forced myself to step forward and look. My boots clopped on the floor a few steps and I was gazing over inside. I followed the trail all the way in to where it finally just pooled and disappeared there. No body. Nothing even inside the lab. It looked like it had been completely empty and unused before someone had gone up and died in the middle of it. Except they weren't there anymore.{&1310}\par Where was the bleeder?{&1310}\par I looked around in the dark. The emergency lights really didn't help for shit. Maybe they'd taken him away? That made sense if someone had been wounded in some kind of accident and they suddenly had to evacuate the level. The \i whole\i0  level, though? I guess I couldn't know without checking the whole place but ... the silence was eerie. You'd think ghosts would stick to planets and the colonies. Terrestrial places. There was too much metal and technology here for that superstitious crap. But no. Somehow that whole place I'd grown up and spent my entire life in just suddenly felt dead and empty and haunted all around me.{&1310}\par It was just this deck. I \i had \i0 to get off this deck. There would still be people on the other decks. Right?{&1310}\par Something caught my eye on the floor and I found a relatively bloodless spot between the jagged shards of broken glass still sticking up from the port hole to lean up on and get a closer look inside. I could have just used the door but ... there was no fucking way I was going in there. So I stuck my head closer, trying to see, and saw it. A mark on the floor.{&1310}\par It was in the blood. I was pretty sure of that. And -- I couldn't be sure without getting in there and looking close but -- I think it was part of a footprint. A bootheel of blood. I didn't bother trying to go inside and look. I just crouched down next to the door and looked for any more.{&1310}\par I found them. Smears of liquid against the deck that the low light turned black. I had a sudden image in my head of a half-dead man getting up out that pool of his own blood and staggering out into the hallway. How could someone who'd lost that much blood even do that? Too many horror vids stuck in the back of my head were telling me zombie. Is that what had happened? Some weird experiment up here finally went wrong and caused a contagion outbreak? What about me? Oh my god was I infected now?{&1310}\par No. They had biocontamination mechanisms in place for that. I know they did. {&1310}\par But what if they failed?{&1310}\par Wait. No.{&1310}\par This was a psychokinetics research deck. The biotics facilities had the bigger, reinforced  labs that none of that shit could get out of if things went wrong. And they didn't have a post on the wall indicating "PK Labs 81-120" on the bulkhead.{&1310}\par It was just above my head when I stood back up, barely legible there in the dark. But these were psychokinetics labs -- \i not\i0  biotics. So that threw that whole worry right out the airlock.{&1310}\par But there was a creeping certainty in the back of my head that I couldn't get rid of so easily. I was trying to ignore it as hard as I could. I didn't want to think about it. \i Couldn't\i0  think about it. But those memory-like dreams were too vivid and lodges inside like an infection of their own. All I could see was that alien world through Sergeant Brennan's eyes when I tried to squeeze my own shut.{&1310}\par The urge to just sit there, plant myself firmly in a corner and tight up into a ball waiting for someone -- \i anyone\i0  -- to come and help me, tell me what the hell had happened to everyone else and left me here all alone in the dark, was overwhelming. Training won out, though. Training and all those horror vids me and Tess used to watch growing up. I wasn't going to die here and no one was going to come save \i me\i0 .{&1310}\par Nothing had changed. I had to get off this deck. I had to find \i someone\i0 . {&1310}\par I got up to follow those bloody footprints. Not because I wanted to -- following obviously terrible clues like that was how the dumb people always got killed in the vids -- Because I \i had\i0  to. I had a feeling they would lead me to a way off that deck and I was right.{&1310}\par I found the lifts, but the lifts were dead just like everything else. Those smudges of blood from some half-dead guy's feet led that way. As I'd followed them the image of someone else picking him up by one shoulder and helping him limp and shuffle his way toward escape popped into my head. Didn't that make more sense? More sense than zombies or monsters, I guess. And it was a comforting thought because I started to calm down. The shadows seemed less thick and stifling, more empty and unthreatening. This wasn't some horrible experiment gone wrong or some kind of attack -- it was just some terrible accident, and they'd had to evacuate this level. That's all.{&1310}\par \i See? And that wasn't so hard to get under control, was it?\i0 {&1310}\par But ... why did they leave \i me\i0 ?{&1310}\par \i Maybe they didn't\i0 .{&1310}\par I don't know where that thought came from but it was weird, and I couldn't shake it as I looked around wondering how the hell I was going to get off this level when the lifts were down. This time, thankfully, without so much of that harried panic that'd followed me out of the lab and down the halls. I got a little frustrated staring at those closed lift doors instead.{&1310}\par Well? What now?{&1310}\par If I'd had anything on me but a busted comm and some casual civvies I might have been able to do something. That got me checking any pockets I had in a rush. {&1310}\par "What ..."{&1310}\par Something in my pocket slipped out of my hand when I tried to pull it out. That slick, oozy feel of old blood I could almost forget about but not really. Whatever it was, it clattered to the floor and I doubled over after it without thinking. Like that little sound would suddenly wake up the empty halls with too much noise.{&1310}\par "... the hell?"{&1310}\par I picked the thing back up and twisted it around in my fingers, trying to get a better look. Some kind of datachip, I thought, but it was hard to tell in the dark. Probably just something Tess had given me or I'd picked up after getting back home. I slipped it back in my jean pocket, but there was nothing else.{&1310}\par So prying the door open with my fingers was what I was left with, and that didn't work out too well. I struggled with each of the doors for a few seconds, trying to peel it back with just my fingertips, before moving onto the next. I lost my grip on one and ended up falling over into the wall, and I almost didn't bother with the last lift -- which was the one I ended up getting open. Not that it mattered that much in the end. {&1310}\par I yanked away until the powered-down lift door was open, but there was only empty space inside. No lift. I wonder if \i that\i0  would have mattered either. What was I going to do with a dead box of steel that wouldn't go anywhere? I don't know. It's not like I knew how to hotwire something like that or anything. Or had any power source to get it moving even if I did.{&1310}\par There were support braces, rivets, and tons of mechanisms that would've been whirring about along the sides of the tube the lift moved through to get to the other decks of the station, but I couldn't climb them. Even powered down and safe, I couldn't climb them. The bulkhead sealed just a little ways down between this deck and the next and I was pretty sure that was some kind of security lockdown against potential hull breaches.{&1310}\par "Well ... \i shit\i0 !"{&1310}\par Panic again. Frustrated panic.{&1310}\par What the hell was I going to do now? The bulkheads being sealed between decks couldn't have been a good sign. It probably meant I couldn't even get off this fucking deck at all!{&1310}\par I slumped back against the wall, wringing my hands back through my hair. I forgot the blood on one of them.{&1310}\par \i What the hell am I supposed to do\i0 ?{&1310}\par I couldn't just die in here. I couldn't. Right?{&1310}\par The thought of that started freaking me out on a whole new level that I could barely even comprehend.{&1310}\par \i Don't think about it. Don't think about it.\i0 {&1310}\par Wait.{&1310}\par I stopped clawing at my scalp and looked up.{&1310}\par There were emergency access tubes, right? For the maintenance guys? Christ, there \i had\i0  to be.{&1310}\par Yes! I'd overheard people working down for Chief Fitzpatrick talking about climbing in there -- the "bowels" of the station and all that. I'd just never really cared or paid much attention to them before, and certainly never climbed inside myself.{&1310}\par I got up and started scrambling around along the walls near the lifts -- I just guessed they might be there, but who knew, it was a place to start at least -- and started chasing that down like a lifeline. It probably was. I'd die in here otherwise, I was sure of it. Chances are the environmental systems wouldn't be giving me any fresh air and I'd die slowly of carbon dioxide poisoning. And if it wasn't that -- dehydration. How did I know anyone would ever even come for me? What if no one was even left alive?{&1310}\par \i Don't think about that\i0 .{&1310}\par Shit. Right. It's not helping.{&1310}\par That hope and that task kept me occupied enough again not to just lose it. I suppose training at the Academy helped a little too, even though I'd never really thought about getting stuck in a situation that might kill me while I was there. You just \i didn't\i0 , not really. I don't care what anybody said. {&1310}\par I spent what felt like hours pawing along the bulkheads for anything that might have been an access hatch to what I was imagining were a complicated, interlacing network that ran throughout the entire station. I knew they were. They had to be. And one of them had to lead to the next deck.{&1310}\par The emergency lighting didn't help. Who designed those things anyways? I could understand why they barely used anything but shenlizite fuel cells for everything else. This backup lighting sucked and I almost didn't realize it when I finally came across exactly what I was looking for.{&1310}\par I felt for the release after I barely missed what the thing was with my searching hands entirely. Just a bit of the bulkhead sticking out but fairely seamless and smooth. I crouched down, got a good look, and immediately tugged on that release. {&1310}\par Considering everything else around here, I'd half-expected the thing to make me fight it open. I guess it must have been mechanical, and that made sense if it was supposed to be used in emergencies. This was \i definitely\i0  an emergency too, so I ignored the warning and threw it open.{&1310}\par I was ready for the dark, and the claustrophobic insides. I hadn't thought much about it but I was definitely prepared to claw my way through there if it meant getting off this haunted level and down to the next deck without being left to rot. What I wasn't ready for, though, was the body I found inside.\cf2\f2 {&1310}\par }{&1310}

My old home. She was giving me a judgmental look out of the corner of her eye as we walked. "Did they even let you sleep on that ship?"{&1310}\par "Eight hours everyday. But I had to spend at least half of them getting ready for the next day, so ... No, not really."{&1310}\par God that was true, and it was terrible now that I thought about it being sort of behind me. They always said you had enough time to get all the sleep you needed but that was BS. They'd give you too much crap to do before the next day for you to get more than three or four hours of sleep at best.{&1310}\par "Yeah, and that new murder-only diet isn't doing much for your face either. You look fucking horrible, so I guess you didn't get a second look from any of those eager, young cadets, huh?"{&1310}\par "Nope. But at least I got to give them all the second looks \i I\i0  felt like," I told her, straight-faced. "Especially in those unisex showers."{&1310}\par "You are such a \i fucking \i0 liar!"{&1310}\par And I got to laugh at that sudden mix of snarky attitude and red-faced gall from being outmaneuvered by me on her face.{&1310}\par "Anyways -- if they were half as hideous as the guys I watched come off that ship with you, I wasn't missing anything. Better off getting eyeballed by an officer with old balls and a pedigree here than some testosterone-junkie barely out of puberty, I guess."{&1310}\par "I think you were the only reason Bertram's was so popular."{&1310}\par "Well my dad wasn't a retired admiral in the Navy, so ... And what do you mean '\i were\i0 '? I still am, bitch. Way to not call me back, by the way. You have \i no\i0  idea how boring it's been here since you left. I swear I never thought messing with these asshat labcoats and their freaky military experiments would ever get boring but holy hell it kinda did. You'd think more of them wouldn't be just plain, well ... \i stupid\i0 ."{&1310}\par She waggled her fingers in the air and threw her voice sarcastically when she said "freaky" so suddenly that I started laughing again. It gave her a chance to snag a cigarette out of her coat inside pocket and light up there while we walked.{&1310}\par "So," she mumbled around the stem, and then puffed out a lungful of smoke to one side, "anything interesting happen that you couldn't tell me while you were being monitored?"{&1310}\par "Who says I'm not being monitored right \i now\i0 ?"{&1310}\par "\i Shut \i0 up." She shook her head, not believing that for a second. And then again, "Anything?"{&1310}\par I thought about it, but there wasn't really all that much that came to mind. I ended up sighing and shrugging instead. {&1310}\par "It really all just kind of ... sucked."{&1310}\par "Oh, come on. Really? "{&1310}\par "Yeah. It really did."{&1310}\par "How long'd it take you to figure that out? I told you it was a fucking horrible idea back when you still had a chance to back out."{&1310}\par She puffed and gave me a look full of chagrine out of the corner of her eye. I just shrugged again.{&1310}\par "I guess you should've listened to your BFF instead of old \i Weir\i0 do, huh? Yeah? You remember that for next time."{&1310}\par The Academy was all dad's idea in the first place, not that I'd ever told her that. She'd thought it was mine, and he'd just been really supportive and excited about the whole thing. Oh, he'd never said anything directly at first, but I had picked up on the hints. He probably thought they'd been subtle, but he was getting old now and I'd caught onto him a long time ago. Not that I'd ever tell him that either, though.{&1310}\par "I know, I know," Tess waved both hands in front of her as we slipped down one of the side alleys from the main causeway -- a shortcut to my old apartment with dad, "following in his footsteps or something like that, but -- come on. He barely even let you go to public class with all the other military brats on station."{&1310}\par She gave me this exasperated look that only she could manage with me. Bertram had made her to go public schooling her whole life and she always gave me shit about being "protected" from it by dad. She might have even resented me a little bit for it, but she never let that really show. Either way, she brought it up now and couldn't help poking fun at me and everything we did as kids all the way back to my old home, laughing it up about anything and everything we could remember before I'd disappeared away to some hellhole out of her life for six whole months.{&1310}\par {&1310}\par \pard\sl480\slmult1\qc\f1\fs20 *\tab *\tab *\f0\fs22 {&1310}\par \pard\fi720\sl480\slmult1\cf2\f2 {&1310}\par \cf1\f0 That moment stuck in my head of a sudden as I followed that trail of blood up and over the dead readout consoles into the lab.

I struggled with each of the doors for a few seconds, trying to peel it back with just my fingertips, before moving onto the next. I lost my grip on one and ended up falling over into the wall, and I almost didn't bother with the last lift -- which was the one I ended up getting open. Not that it mattered that much in the end. {&1310}\par I yanked away until the powered-down lift door was open, but there was only empty space inside. No lift. I wondered if \i that\i0  would have mattered either. What was I going to do with a dead box of steel that wouldn't go anywhere? I don't know. It's not like I knew how to hotwire something like that or anything. Or had any power source to get it moving even if I did.{&1310}\par There were support braces, rivets, and tons of mechanisms that would've been whirring about along the sides of the tube the lift moved through to get to the other decks of the station, but I couldn't climb them. Even powered down and safe, I couldn't climb them. The bulkhead sealed just a little ways down between this deck and the next and I was pretty sure that was some kind of security lockdown against potential hull breaches.{&1310}\par "Well ... \i shit\i0 !"{&1310}\par Panic again. Frustrated panic.{&1310}\par What the hell was I going to do now? The bulkheads being sealed between decks couldn't have been a good sign. It probably meant I couldn't even get off this fucking deck at all!{&1310}\par I slumped back against the wall, wringing my hands back through my hair. I forgot the blood on one of them.{&1310}\par \i What the hell am I supposed to do\i0 ?{&1310}\par I couldn't just die in here. I couldn't. Right?{&1310}\par The thought of that started freaking me out on a whole new level that I could barely even comprehend.{&1310}\par \i Don't think about it. Don't think about it.\i0 {&1310}\par Wait.{&1310}\par I stopped clawing at my scalp and looked up.{&1310}\par There were emergency access tubes, right? For the maintenance guys? Christ, there \i had\i0  to be.{&1310}\par Yes! I'd overheard people working down for Chief Fitzpatrick talking about climbing in there -- the "bowels" or "arteries" of the station or something cute and stupid like that. I'd just never really cared or paid much attention to them before, and certainly never climbed inside myself. And they tried to teach you to pay attention to \i everything\i0  in a life or death situation at the Academy.{&1310}\par I got up and started scrambling around along the walls near the lifts -- I just guessed they might be there, but who knew, it was a place to start at least -- and started chasing that down like a lifeline. It probably was. I'd die in here otherwise, I was sure of it. Chances are the environmental systems wouldn't be giving me any fresh air and I'd die slowly of carbon dioxide poisoning. And if it wasn't that -- dehydration. How did I know anyone would ever even come for me? What if no one was even left alive?{&1310}\par \i Don't think about that\i0 .{&1310}\par Shit. Right. It's not helping.{&1310}\par That hope and that task kept me occupied enough again not to just lose it. I suppose training at the Academy helped a little too, even though I'd never really thought about getting stuck in a situation that might kill me while I was there. You just \i didn't\i0 , not really. I don't care what anybody said. {&1310}\par I spent what felt like hours pawing along the bulkheads for anything that might have been an access hatch to what I was imagining were a complicated, interlacing network that ran throughout the entire station. I knew they were. They had to be. And one of them had to lead to the next deck.{&1310}\par The emergency lighting didn't help. Who designed those things anyways? I could understand why they barely used anything but shenlizite fuel cells for everything else. This backup lighting sucked and I almost didn't realize it when I finally came across exactly what I was looking for.{&1310}\par I felt for the release after I barely missed what the thing was with my searching hands entirely. Just a bit of the bulkhead sticking out but still all but seamless and smooth. I crouched down, squinted to get a good look, and immediately tugged on that release. {&1310}\par Considering everything else around here, I'd half-expected the thing to make me fight it open. I guess it must have been mechanical, and that made sense if it was supposed to be used in emergencies. This was \i definitely\i0  an emergency too, so I ignored the warning and threw it open.{&1310}\par I was ready for the dark, and the claustrophobic insides. I hadn't thought much about it but I was definitely prepared to claw my way through there if it meant getting off this haunted level and down to the next deck without being left to rot. What I wasn't ready for, though, was the body I found inside.\cf2\f2 {&1310}\par }{&1310}
