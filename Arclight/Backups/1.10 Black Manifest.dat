Packed in with stinking, huddled masses of poor travelers dredged up from what must have been every desolate hole in the sector. There was a reason he had chosen Riftwatch all those years ago, and it wasn't just because of the old charlatan's prophecy. He enjoyed the solitude. There was no space to think in this festering cell.{&1310}\par It was necessary. Just like everything he had had to do for the past two decades. He kept reminding himself of that, especially when he looked down into that dusky face with those familiar almond eyes.{&1310}\par "So," the girl was speaking again. She huffed out a heavy breath through her teeth. "Are you going to tell me where we're going or not?"{&1310}\par Sitting in the bowels of a rickety old transport cruiser had drained her enthusiasm that much more. She had gotten a sarcastic attitude with him over the past twenty-four hours. A combination of several things, he was sure. Not to forget her little explosion at the docking platform when she found out they wouldn't be going back to the shuttle or that he had left her other bags behind in Riftwatch. That had soured her quite a bit. But, in the end, he assumed it was just because he refused to tell her anything she did not need to know. Which was a lot.{&1310}\par They would be almost a week to Dreggor, stuck down there the whole while. Evelyn was hunched over next to him on the floor, lost amidst the throngs of squatting, coughing, filth-mongering other passengers.

It became an effort not to feel more sympathy for her and that situation he was putting her through.{&1310}\par It was necessary.{&1310}\par "You'll know when we get there," he told her.

The next several days would be long and insufferable, he knew. And matters would only escalate when they were done. All of a sudden, he had so much to do with so little time left to do it. It was a crushing weight that he had known so long ago that he could not escape. Ironic how the decision had seemed so simple back then. They alwasy did.{&1310}\par But now ... {&1310}\par Now, he looked down at that innocent girl beside him all grown up and ...{&1310}\par Well. None of it seemed so easy anymore. He could still remember the day he took her away.{&1310}\par "Evelyn."{&1310}\par She rounded back on him once more, frowning.{&1310}\par "Yeah?"{&1310}\par He opened his mouth to tell her something. Maybe it was being in that place, alone, and so far from everything else that mattered just then. Maybe it was in seeing that look in profile on her face that reminded him so much of the mother she never knew. Maybe. But he would never know.{&1310}\par Something else snapped inside his head, hurling every other thought away.{&1310}\par It was several, long moments before Nolan stirred again. The girl's frown turned anxious and worried as he sat there staring off into space and through her like she wasn't even there. His face went white, and he started to shake.{&1310}\par "Dad ...?"{&1310}\par When she reached to touch him, he gasped back to life so suddenly she jumped herself. It took him another moment to steady his trembling hands. But then he was digging them into her arm.{&1310}\par "We need to get out of here!" he hissed in her face.{&1310}\par She opened her mouth to say something, but he never gave her the chance. Bounding back up to his feet, he hauled her up bodily with him. She might have cried out in surprise at the suddenness of it, but it was the furthest thing from Nolan's mind just then. He could \i feel\i0  the universe coming apart around them.{&1310}\par They had to climb over the hordes of destitute to get to the other side of the cabin. They barely seemed to notice. He didn't. A lot of coughing, low whispers, and a few children crying. He ignored it, pulling the girl right through now as if it were nothing.{&1310}\par "Uh ..."{&1310}\par He hit the doors and yanked her through without another word. They were in a corridor then, leading back toward the deck ports where they had boarded and ladder and stairwells to the upper decks.

He just snatched her hand back, hauling her along again down the hall. She twisted around, eying the guard's body as they stalked away, leaving him quickly behind.{&1310}\par He gave a few more security that got in the way his violent sleep treatment as they made their way through the lower decks and up. A cold sweat sheathed Nolan's face, and he had to grit his teeth to make himself go on when they reached a stairwell. It didn't go up as far as he needed it to, but he was having a hard time keeping his thinking straight. Not with that rending sound like the gnashing of teeth on space itself so deafening in his ears. A lesser man might have clawed them out.

Not that there was anything else he could do for her. He was scared himself, and with much more good reason to be. He knew everything that she did not, and there were a good many reasons to worry about whether or not they would even survive the next few minutes. That he had somehow been outmaneuvered was not lost on him in the slightest.{&1310}\par And that was why, in some ways, it was a godsend when they reached the next corridor and they were suddenly not alone anymore.

I grabbed my \i one\i0  bag, and stood again.{&1310}\par "Okay ..."{&1310}\par "Come on." He snatched my arm in an icy grip before I had even gotten the pack slipped back on, and dragged me hurriedly away.{&1310}\par We had to climb over a bunch of those poor people to get to the other side of the cabin.

And dad just pulled my right on through it as if it were nothing.{&1310}\par "Uh ..."{&1310}\par He hit the doors to some other room, and yanked me through with one last look behind for good measure. We were in some kind of hallway then. And I guess we weren't supposed to be there, because there was a uniformed man with a heavy shock-stick that came at us with an angry look.{&1310}\par "No one's allowed out of the aft lounge during transit," he started to say. By his tone, I guess he was pretty used to dealing with the kinds of people stuffed together back in the cabin. But dad didn't give him a chance to do much else.{&1310}\par My ears twitched as he swung a hand up. The Voidtongue again.

And I just stared, wide-eyed, at the man on the ground.{&1310}\par "What did you do \i that\i0  for?"

I didn't know where he was going, or why. And he could barely stop long enough to make sure he was going the way he meant to, let alone to explain any of that mess to me. I tried to keep up with him the best I could. {&1310}\par It was hard not to get a little worried at the way he was carrying on. A few glimpses of his deceptively serene face told me enough. A cold sweat glimmered at the sides. Maybe he hid it from me more than himself, but I could tell. He was scared. And that started to absolute terrify me.{&1310}\par I was a nervous wreck too by the time we got upstairs. And I nearly jumped out of my skin when we abruptly came up short at the site of hooded figure from before standing alone in the next corridor.{&1310}\par Dad let me go, and pushed me back behind him. I noticed what he must have instantly, a moment later. The few guards that littered the floor ahead weren't his work. They had throats cut and stomachs sliced open, already bled out onto the deck. Already dead. And that hooded figure stood in the middle of them.{&1310}\par How did he get ahead of us?{&1310}\par I didn't have long to wonder at that, though. Footsteps clambered down the stairwell behind us, and I twisted around. Another, smaller dark figure was coming up after us from down there, with two of the biggest and ugliest looking monsters I had ever seen to either side. Huge, yellowed fangs poked out from lumpy faces, both hunkering down to keep their tufted heads underneath the ceiling. They took up the entire stairway.{&1310}\par Dad lifted a hand, lips moving quickly. Those three down below stopped at the gesture like they knew what it meant. And he held them there for a moment, eyes darting back and forth between them and the lone man standing ahead. I just stood there, still as stone and wondering what the hell was going on. I wasn't quite brave enough to ask it, though.{&1310}\par "You know why I'm here," the man down the corridor uttered then. His voice was low, and rich. He was big beneath his rags too, and I caught a glint of steel when I looked. For a moment, I could feel the eyes beneath his hood on me. And my skin crawled (so bad{&47}until) I was sure it would slide right off the bone. But he wasn't talking to me.{&1310}\par "Hand over the girl," was all he said. To dad. I glanced back down toward the three below, the brutish monsters inching closer when they thought dad wasn't paying enough attention. The third, a woman, held her ground for now.{&1310}\par And that was when I suddenly realized just who he meant for dad to hand over.{&1310}\par "\i What\i0 ?" {&1310}\par I did shriek at him this time. I looked from the man to the woman and the two monsters, and tried to squeeze myself even further away against the wall behind dad. The woman below was eying me like she meant to disect my insides, and those two brutes just looked hungry. The hooded man didn't pay me any more notice, but that hate seething in the air was so thick I could almost taste it.{&1310}\par Dad stuck his other hand up in my face to silence me. For once, I couldn't even argue.{&1310}\par "You're a fool if you think I would ever do so willingly," he said right back at the hooded man. The tone of his voice was new. Dangerous. I had never heard him talk like that before. To anyone. "Step aside. \i Now\i0 ."{&1310}\par I would have. Oh god, but I would have if he had been talking to me just then, and I scrunched even deeper against the wall. But he wasn't. And the other man didn't seem to care.{&1310}\par "I am sorry that you feel that way ... old man."{&1310}\par The way he said it was slow. Threatening. {&1310}\par Something moved underneath his rags.{&1310}\par And so did dad.{&1310}\par Light filled the corridor in an instant. Blinding. I felt a hand catch and shove me back into the wall, and I bounced off into the ground with a pitiful thud. Fire and lightning screamed overhead, eating up all other sound until the whole world around was thunder and burning flesh. I clapped both hands over my ears and hugged the deck like there was nothing else. And, for a single moment, there wasn't.{&1310}\par Then I saw dad again.{&1310}\par Nolan Weir's hands were on fire. His face was still smooth, but his eyes blazed (bright{&47}hot) with that murderous inferno. First one way, and then the other - he rounded on the three behind and lobbed a ball of fire down the stairs. It hit one of the brutes. There was a crack like a whip. Then the whole stair went up in flames, chunks of the beast roaring out of it.{&1310}\par The hooded man in rags was next. Dad's other hand leapt up, and lightning flashed. It snapped into those rags, lighting them up. The man tumbled back over into the wall without a sound.{&1310}\par Thunder boomed.{&1310}\par Dad had my arm in his hand then, tearing me back up from the floor.{&1310}\par "Run! Get out of here!" {&1310}\par He shouted at me over the storm. Impossibly, I could already hear the two still remaining below scrambling up the steps again. I stared at him dumbly, wide-eyed and in shock. And he just snatched my dead weight to him, snarling down my neck.{&1310}\par "Get off the ship!"{&1310}\par The one remaining brute was on us. It loomed out of the smoke and flames with its yellow-fanged maw gaping. Dad flicked a wrist without a second thought, sending it spinning over backwards in tiny pieces and away. I think I started to choke.{&1310}\par He hauled me up again, and shoved me headlong ahead into the corridor. I stumbled wildly past the man in rags, leaden limbs flailing, and hit the deck again at the other end. And I sat there for a long moment, gagging on rent flesh, coppery blood, and the impossibility of it all. {&1310}\par Dad caught me up behind.{&1310}\par "Evelyn! Run!" he shouted again, and I twisted back around. This time, though, it was to freeze up as that hooded man came up behind dad. A long, wicked black blade dangled in one hand beneath those rags. And as the old man looked at me with his angrily pleading eyes, that other grabbed him by the shoulder and stuck him through.{&1310}\par I don't know how, but I was running after that. And the last thing I saw of dad was that hooded figure standing over him with his black sword before everything (dissolved into tears{&47}just fell apart around me).\cf2\f1\fs20 {&1310}\par }{&1310}

I looked from the man to the woman and the two monsters, and tried to squeeze myself even further away against the wall behind dad. The woman below was eying me like she meant to disect my insides, and those two brutes just looked hungry. The hooded man didn't pay me any more notice, but that hate seething in the air was so thick I could almost taste it.{&1310}\par Dad stuck his other hand up in my face to silence me. For once, I couldn't even argue.{&1310}\par "You're a fool if you think I would ever do so willingly," he said right back at the hooded man. The tone of his voice was new. Dangerous. I had never heard him talk like that before. To anyone. "Step aside. \i Now\i0 ."{&1310}\par I would have. Oh god, but I would have if he had been talking to me just then, and I scrunched even deeper against the wall. But he wasn't. And the other man didn't seem to care.{&1310}\par "I am sorry that you feel that way ... old man."{&1310}\par The way he said it was slow. Threatening. {&1310}\par Something moved underneath his rags.{&1310}\par And so did dad.{&1310}\par Light filled the corridor in an instant. Blinding. I felt a hand catch and shove me back into the wall, and I bounced off into the ground with a pitiful thud. Fire and lightning screamed overhead, eating up all other sound until the whole world around was thunder and burning flesh. I clapped both hands over my ears and hugged the deck like there was nothing else. And, for a single moment, there wasn't.{&1310}\par Then I saw dad again.{&1310}\par Nolan Weir's hands were on fire. His face was still smooth, but his eyes blazed (bright{&47}hot) with that murderous inferno. First one way, and then the other - he rounded on the three behind and lobbed a ball of fire down the stairs. It hit one of the brutes. There was a crack like a whip. Then the whole stair went up in flames, chunks of the beast roaring out of it.{&1310}\par The hooded man in rags was next. Dad's other hand leapt up, and lightning flashed. It snapped into those rags, lighting them up. The man tumbled back over into the wall without a sound.{&1310}\par Thunder boomed.{&1310}\par Dad had my arm in his hand then, tearing me back up from the floor.{&1310}\par "Run! Get out of here!" {&1310}\par He shouted at me over the storm. Impossibly, I could already hear the two still remaining below scrambling up the steps again. I stared at him dumbly, wide-eyed and in shock. And he just snatched my dead weight to him, snarling down my neck.{&1310}\par "Get off the ship!"{&1310}\par The one remaining brute was on us. It loomed out of the smoke and flames with its yellow-fanged maw gaping. Dad flicked a wrist without a second thought, sending it spinning over backwards in tiny pieces and away. I think I started to choke.{&1310}\par He hauled me up again, and shoved me headlong ahead into the corridor. I stumbled wildly past the man in rags, leaden limbs flailing, and hit the deck again at the other end. And I sat there for a long moment, gagging on rent flesh, coppery blood, and the impossibility of it all. {&1310}\par Dad caught me up behind.{&1310}\par "Evelyn! Run!" he shouted again, and I twisted back around. This time, though, it was to freeze up as that hooded man came up behind dad. A long, wicked black blade dangled in one hand beneath those rags. And as the old man looked at me with his angrily pleading eyes, that other grabbed him by the shoulder and stuck him through.{&1310}\par I don't know how, but I was running after that. And the last thing I saw of dad was that hooded figure standing over him with his black sword before everything (dissolved into tears{&47}just fell apart around me).\cf2\f1\fs20 {&1310}\par }{&1310}

And she grumbled out another irritable groan at that. He ignored it.{&1310}\par "Of \i course\i0  I will. But I want to know \i now\i0  ..."{&1310}\par But Nolan just hunched in deeper upon himself. The next several days would be long and insufferable, he knew. And matters would only escalate when they were done. All of a sudden, he had so much to do with so little time left to do it. It was a crushing weight that he had known so long ago that he could not escape. Ironic how the decision had seemed so simple back then. They alwasy did.{&1310}\par But now ... {&1310}\par Now, he looked down at that innocent girl beside him all grown up and ...{&1310}\par Well. None of it seemed so easy anymore. He could still remember the day he took her away.{&1310}\par "Evelyn."{&1310}\par She rounded back on him once more, frowning.{&1310}\par "Yeah?"{&1310}\par He opened his mouth to tell her something. Maybe it was being in that place, alone, and so far from everything else that mattered just then. Maybe it was in seeing that look in profile on her face that reminded him so much of the mother she never knew. Maybe. But he would never know.{&1310}\par Something else snapped inside his head, hurling every other thought away.{&1310}\par It was several, long moments before Nolan stirred again. The girl's frown turned anxious and worried as he sat there staring off into space and through her like she wasn't even there. His face went white, and he started to shake.{&1310}\par "Dad ...?"{&1310}\par When she reached to touch him, he gasped back to life so suddenly she jumped herself. It took him another moment to steady his trembling hands. But then he was digging them into her arm.{&1310}\par "We need to get out of here!" he hissed in her face.{&1310}\par She opened her mouth to say something, but he never gave her the chance. Bounding back up to his feet, he hauled her up bodily with him. She might have cried out in surprise at the suddenness of it, but it was the furthest thing from Nolan's mind just then. He could \i feel\i0  the universe coming apart around them.{&1310}\par They had to climb over the hordes of destitute to get to the other side of the cabin. They barely seemed to notice. He didn't. A lot of coughing, low whispers, and a few children crying. He ignored it, pulling the girl right through now as if it were nothing.{&1310}\par "Uh ..."{&1310}\par He hit the doors and yanked her through without another word. They were in a corridor then, leading back toward the deck ports where they had boarded and ladder and stairwells to the upper decks. None of the poor running in the bowels of the ship were supposed to be allowed out, though, and a uniformed man with a heavy shock-stick came at them immediately with an angry look.{&1310}\par "No one's allowed out of the aft lounge during transit," he started to say. Disinterested. Almost bored. He was used to dealing with the kinds of people stuffed together back in the hold behind. But Nolan didn't give him a chance to do much else.{&1310}\par He swung a hand up, words of power fluttering across his lips. He shouted the last at the guard and it threw him over into the wall, out cold without another word. The man slumped down to the deck on his side. The girl stared, wide-eyed, at that body on the ground.{&1310}\par "What did you do \i that\i0  for?" she shrieked at him in surprise.{&1310}\par "Keep moving," was all Nolan said, not bothering to answer, or wait for her to pick up again. He just snatched her hand back, hauling her along again down the hall. She twisted around, eying the guard's body as they stalked away, leaving him quickly behind.{&1310}\par He gave a few more security that got in the way his violent sleep treatment as they made their way through the lower decks and up. A cold sweat sheathed Nolan's face, and he had to grit his teeth to make himself go on when they reached a stairwell. It didn't go up as far as he needed it to, but he was having a hard time keeping his thinking straight. Not with that rending sound like the gnashing of teeth on space itself so deafening in his ears. A lesser man might have clawed them out. But a lesser man would not have been as attuned as he was.{&1310}\par A blessing, and a curse. For once in his long life, he wasn't entirely sure just why.{&1310}\par The girl was scared. Not that there was anything else he could do for her. He was scared himself, and with much more good reason to be. He knew everything that she did not, and there were a good many reasons to worry about whether or not they would even survive the next few minutes. That he had somehow been outmaneuvered was not lost on him in the slightest.{&1310}\par And that was why, in some ways, it was a godsend when they reached the next corridor and they were suddenly not alone anymore. No guards came at them this time. They had already crossed into the upper decks. No. Instead, their bodies were strewn all over the floor.\cf2\f1\fs20 {&1310}\par }{&1310}

Sullen, even. It brought Nolan back out of his reverie. She turned her head to look up at him when he didn't answer right away, and caught him staring.{&1310}\par "-- What?"{&1310}\par He shook his head and glanced away. He had been digging up old memories a lot of late. Too much that should remain buried. It was distracting him from what needed to be done.{&1310}\par They had been crowded in the lower decks for more than a day now. Packed in with stinking, huddled masses of poor travelers dredged up from what must have been every desolate hole in the sector. There was a reason he had chosen Riftwatch all those years ago, and it wasn't just because of the old charlatan's prophecies. He enjoyed the solitude. There was no space to think in this festering cell.{&1310}\par It was necessary. Just like everything he had had to do for the past two decades. He kept reminding himself of that, especially when he looked down into that dusky face with those familiar almond eyes.{&1310}\par "So," the girl was speaking again. She huffed out a heavy breath through her teeth. "Are you going to tell me where we're going or not?"{&1310}\par Sitting in the bowels of a rickety old transport cruiser for two days had drained her enthusiasm that much more. She had gotten a sarcastic attitude with him over the past twenty-four hours. A combination of several things, he was sure. Not to forget her little explosion at the docking platform when she found out they wouldn't be going back to the shuttle or that he had left her other bags behind in Riftwatch. That had soured her quite a bit. But, in the end, he assumed it was just because he refused to tell her anything she did not need to know. Which was a lot.{&1310}\par They would be half a week to Dregoran, stuck down there the whole while. Evelyn was hunched over next to him on the floor, lost amidst the throngs of squatting, coughing, filth-mongering passengers. She looked almost as miserable as they did now, if not nearly so unwashed. It became an effort not to feel more sympathy for her and that situation he was putting her through.{&1310}\par It was necessary.{&1310}\par "You'll know when we get there," he told her. And she grumbled out another irritable groan at that. He ignored it.{&1310}\par "Of \i course\i0  I will. But I want to know \i now\i0  ..."{&1310}\par But Nolan just hunched in deeper upon himself.

He shouted the last of it at the guard and it threw him over into the wall, out cold without another sound. The man slumped down to the deck on his side. The girl stared, wide-eyed, at that body on the ground.{&1310}\par "What did you do \i that\i0  for?" she shrieked at him in surprise. He had been very careful never to let her see him use the Aetherian arts on another human being before. It was a shock that could not be helped.{&1310}\par "Keep moving," was all Nolan said, not bothering to answer, or wait for her to pick up again.
