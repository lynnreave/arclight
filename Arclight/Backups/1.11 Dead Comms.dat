She didn't sound like she had cared much and I \i guess\i0  she hadn't said \i anything\i0  about a rescue so ... {&1310}\par I wanted to chew on my nails through the suit. I wanted to punch the hull and growl into the comm. I wanted to yell back at that woman -- \i anything\i0  to keep from flipping the fuck out at that pause that went on forever. I had to be professional. They must have been military. They \i sounded\i0  military. And I didn't want to be treated like just some dumb, unimportant civilian right now. I wanted out of this black, empty nothingness. {&1310}\par Right. Fucking. NOW.{&1310}\par That wait went on for minutes. It felt like hours. And I had this image of them ignoring me altogether while a desperate battle raged on for the station inside my head.{&1310}\par "Hello?" I tried again, finally. Desperately. "Is anyone still there? This is Evelyn Weir and I need someone to he-"{&1310}\par "Unit and designation, please."{&1310}\par Someone new. A new voice broke in on top of me, cutting me off. A man this time.{&1310}\par "Yes! I'm here -- I mean, this is Evelyn Weir and I need someone to come and get me. Situation ... critical?"{&1310}\par "Unit and designation, please," that voice repeated perfunctorily.{&1310}\par "What? I don't \i have\i0  any of those, I'm just ... \i stuck\i0  out here."{&1310}\par This guy wasn't yelling at me like the other one. I briefly wondered what the hell had even happened to her, but ...{&1310}\par \i God\i0 . T\i hat bitch probably \i0 did \i just blow me off.{&1310}\par \i0 Fuck, this guy better not too.{&1310}\par There was an annoyed sigh over the comm that I barely caught. Not a good sign. Then his voice again.{&1310}\par "What sector are you in? Extractions are authorized for KIAs only."{&1310}\par "Well, I'm not dead!"{&1310}\par I don't know why I felt like yelling that at him, but I did.{&1310}\par Another sigh, and I think he growled something about "auxiliaries" and "standard protocol" but I couldn't really tell.{&1310}\par "Give me your name again," he demanded with some of that frustration bleeding through. I ignored that and just told him. Then I waited for another pause while the comm went quiet.{&1310}\par \i This had better not go like the last one or I'll ... I'll ...\i0 {&1310}\par I'd what? Do what? Nothing? What could I do? Probably nothing.{&1310}\par \i Fuck\i0 .{&1310}\par I waited again. I looked at the ship's hull and tried to put my other hand through to rub my forehead but only bumped into faceplate. I just needed someone to come get me! How hard could that be? I didn't even want to \i think\i0  about what it would mean to be left alone out here too long. Those creepy monsters back in the research tower were beginning to almost seem more appealing than -- than suffocating to death!{&1310}\par Or ... no. {&1310}\par No.{&1310}\par Getting eaten was still worse.{&1310}\par Yeah.{&1310}\par I shook my head forlornly in my helmet.{&1310}\par ... How? \i How \i0 had this leave gone from fretting over dad and failing out of the academy to debating what was the worst way to die? {&1310}\par \i Poor life decisions, I guess.\i0 {&1310}\par Another salvo of pods overhead. I watched them without caring as much this second time. I mean, I \i cared\i0 , but I couldn't care actively right now. It's not like there was anything I could do about it. But I watched them. I watched them shoot towards the station with an uncomfortable, impatient detachment.{&1310}\par Those pods could only have meant fighting. An attack. Who? Pirates? There was no way pirates could have gotten this close and through all the regional defenses. Tau? Maybe, but Riftwatch was far from the borders of their space, and they were getting farther away with each year. It wasn't a great target to open a new war on if that's what was happening. {&1310}\par I was hugging an enemy ship. I was pretty sure of that, at least. How far away I'd flown from the station really started to dawn on me then. I'd been shouting into an open frequency, but who would be listening for it if they were under attack? \i Especially\i0  if the rest of the station was even half as bad as what I'd seen in the research tower.{&1310}\par "Excuse me ... Miss Weir?"{&1310}\par That woman had asked for an ID number. And the guy had wanted a unit and designation. Operational details.{&1310}\par Station military details wouldn't be broadcasting out this far if they were under attack ...{&1310}\par Right?{&1310}\par "Miss Weir, are you still there?"{&1310}\par Change in tone. That was the first thing I noticed when that guy suddenly came back. He'd been monotone, text-book, frustrated with me, but professional otherwise -- the way an ops command comms officer might be? -- before. Now he was suddenly polite. Asking me questions instead of demanding answers in order to proceed, or quoting standard procedure.{&1310}\par A command deck comms officer would be someone maybe listening for chatter on short-range frequencies. A comms officer that was part of the attack. {&1310}\par Dead comms. Extractions for KIAs. Sectors.{&1310}\par "Miss Weir?"{&1310}\par "... yeah?" My voice came out small and almost without me even realizing it.{&1310}\par "I asked if you could please tell me where you are so I can send someone to come get you."{&1310}\par \i Oh god \i0\'85{&1310}\par All those thoughts suddenly coalesced into something almost comically tragic.{&1310}\par \i I'm talking to the enemy.\i0 {&1310}\par  How ...{&1310}\par What-{&1310}\par "Miss Weir?" that too-nice voice nagged me again. I'd been staring at the ship in shock and must've given him some long, awkward pause.{&1310}\par "Wh-what?" I managed to stammer out.{&1310}\par They didn't know. They didn't know I knew.{&1310}\par "Is something wrong? Are you all right?"{&1310}\par "I, um ..."{&1310}\par I glanced around at empty space. The station. That hull around me. Like any of it would help me. It didn't.{&1310}\par "I'm fine."{&1310}\par "Good," he continued without skipping a beat. He didn't know. "Now I need you to activate your comm unit to broadcast your position so that we can send a team to come get you. Do you know how to do that?"{&1310}\par He hadn't noticed my lungs seizing up in shock and me having to force that answer out of me to sound normal. Like I didn't know who he was and what he was after. Because I didn't?{&1310}\par I didn't know who they were, but I was pretty sure I knew what they were going to do to me if I told them where I was. Kidnap me, I guess? Maybe that wasn't so bad compared to floating out here until I died or that ship finally moved. I'd be torn off the hull if it moved to velocity.{&1310}\par Christ, don't even think about that.{&1310}\par "Miss Weir?"{&1310}\par Fuck!{&1310}\par "Yes?"{&1310}\par "Can you broadcast your position for me, please?"{&1310}\par Is that what I was going to do? Wave a flag for the same people who wanted to cut off my head back in my room earlier?{&1310}\par Well ... what choices did I have, really? I was alone, and I couldn't stay in vacuum forever. And there was still the possibility that I was just being paranoid. What if he \i was\i0  with the station defense force? Or those weren't attackers at all but something completely different that I just had no idea about at all? It's not like I'd have been told anything important anyways. And I \i had\i0  been MIA for the past couple hours -- or however long -- at least.{&1310}\par I started moving a shaky hand toward where the transmitter would be on the side of my faceplate. They'd showed us them before -- back at the academy. There'd been brief SOS exercises in the introduction courses to zero-G training. {&1310}\par "Yes," I said, voice shaking just like my hand. I wondered if he noticed and could possibly guess what I was so scared of. Hopefully not.{&1310}\par I found the manual switch, but hesitated. I hesitated long enough that I expected to hear that comms guy in my ear again, coaxing me to basically surrender myself to people I was fairly sure I didn't want to meet. I hesitated.{&1310}\par Eventually, though, I just squeezed my eyes shut and turned it on.{&1310}\par "It's on," I whispered over the comm at him, not entirely sure just what that would eventually mean.{&1310}\par "Great," he said. "Just hold tight and wait for pickup."{&1310}\par "Okay."{&1310}\par He closed the line. {&1310}\par \i I guess that's it then.\i0 {&1310}\par The silence wasn't so oppressive now. Now it was waiting for sound and motion that made me nervous. But I did have a few minutes to think, at least. Or maybe that wasn't such a good thing because I just thought about those two men back on the station.{&1310}\par If those memories hadn't come trickling back, I wouldn't have worried so much at being captured or even cared. That comms officer hadn't sounded much like a pirate -- or what I expected one to sound like, I guess. Professional. Military. More like another Grand Admiral's fleet or a Tau invasion force, maybe. No, I would've just been taken prisoner and maybe held for a while or ransomed. Scary, yes, but not terrifying since I wasn't of any real importance to any military operation. I just hoped that I wasn't so \i un\i0 important that they'd just get rid of me and be done with it.{&1310}\par No. Mohawk and Beardface had been trying to kidnap me. \i Me\i0 . And the comms guy changed once he'd looked up my name or whatever. I \i was\i0  important in some small way, at least. And those two guys back on the station had been willing to kill me if they couldn't get me out alive.{&1310}\par Why me? No idea. But it wasn't at all just paranoid to make a connection between that attempted kidnapping{&47}murder and these people probably attacking the station right now.{&1310}\par Wait.{&1310}\par Wait.{&1310}\par Wait.{&1310}\par Those people attacking the station. They couldn't just be looking for \i me\i0  ... {&1310}\par ... Could they?{&1310}\par No. No, that would be \i crazy \i0 ...{&1310}\par As crazy as two guys trying to kidnap me in my own room in the middle of the night?{&1310}\par No. It was \i way\i0  crazier than that even. Like, by a \i lot\i0 . Attacking the whole \i station\i0 ? A guarded military research station? No freaking way I was worth that much to \i anyone\i0 .{&1310}\par The thought made me laugh out of context. Wow, that would've been flattering in the weirdest fucking way.{&1310}\par Dad. They must have been after dad. Me? I wasn't important enough. Dr. Nolan Weir, though ... retired \i Admiral\i0  Dr. Nolan Weir, though ... powerful, ex-soldier-with-a-laundry-list-of-secret-accolades-for-super-secret-weapons-research Nolan Weir, though ...{&1310}\par Who knew what he was working on now. Or how important it could be. They'd use me to get to him. Threaten to kill me, probably. It made the only sense.{&1310}\par God ... if this was all just some infighting between Grand Admirals over competing science experiments, I'd --{&1310}\par \i What? It's not like there's anything \i0 you \i can do.\i0 {&1310}\par I slumped. {&1310}\par \i Especially while I'm stuck out here.{&1310}\par \i0 What were a few dead scientists next to a Grand Admiral.? Or even a few \i thousand\i0 ?{&1310}\par I just kept floating there, with paralytic thoughts too big for my non-existent rank and clearance.{&1310}\par I guess I was going to disappoint dad for more than just flunking out.{&1310}\par It took a little while, but eventually a shuttle swung down silently into view, bright forlights streaming across the hull of the ship behind me. I doubted it had come from the station or else it would've been shot down. But I waited. I waited while they scanned around in my general vicinity for whatever visual confirmation of a weird person floating beside their big ship that they needed. Then the light was on me.{&1310}\par "Weir, is that you?"{&1310}\par A voice came on inside my headpiece as that light slipped over finally and blinded me. I waved a hand back at them because what else was I going to do? Make a break for it? That channel was cleaner now, and the voice was from someone new. Some other woman, but she sounded kind of familiar. Not like the first one, but ... someone I ...{&1310}\par "Stay where you are."{&1310}\par Thrusters flared to life on either side of the shuttle and it went into a controlled spin, pivoting until the rear-entry hatch was facing me -- one of those silent ballet's of near-perfect motion you saw whenever you stopped to watch machines move in space.{&1310}\par "Push off and get inside," was the next command.{&1310}\par I said goodbye to my grip on the hull -- reluctantly, but only because panicked thoughts of floating off forever into the void were still all too fresh inside my mind. That and this whole thing had a disturbed pit in my stomach.{&1310}\par I had to do something. I couldn't just let them take me hostage.{&1310}\par \i They might just kill me anyways\i0 . \i They tried to before\i0 .{&1310}\par How the hell had I even gotten out of there that time? I ... couldn't remember. But it wasn't going to happen again. I had nowhere to run out here, and no one else to help me.{&1310}\par Six months in advanced combat, incursion, and tactics training courses. What was it good for if not for something like this? Life or death?{&1310}\par There was only one way out of here alive.{&1310}\par \i I'm not helpless\i0 . \i I'm \i0 not.{&1310}\par Nervousness fluttered around in my guts as I drifted fast and not fast enough over to the open rear hatch of the shuttle. I could do this. I could -- because I'd be dead soon if I didn't. I tried to remember training. I tried to remember everything that had ever been yelled at me back at the academy. And I stuffed that anxiety down and tried to get control for once.{&1310}\par My boots were sucked down toward the floor as soon as I got inside the airlock and I almost forgot to stick them out so I landed on my feet. Deep breath. My palms were clammy inside the suit and I tried to rub them together through the material. The airlock was closed and I could see the re-pressurizing light blink on overhead.{&1310}\par Deep breath.{&1310}\par They didn't know I knew they were after me, and that was the only advantage I had. So I had to strike first. Surprise. But I had to be fast. I couldn't let them get this shuttle back into that ship, and I was ninety-nine percent sure that was exactly where we were going once they had me in hand.{&1310}\par I hit the release button on my faceplate as soon as the air was almost normal again, holding my breath for a second while I tore off the headsleeve and moved toward the inner airlock door. That knife was still in my hand, but I wasn't ready to kill anyone just yet. Not if I didn't have to. I switched the suit's built-in comms to silent mode.{&1310}\par Deep breath.{&1310}\par There wasn't much room between the door and the bulkhead, but I squeezed back out of view while I waited for someone to open it. I'd probably only get one shot, and they probably had guns.{&1310}\par I didn't have to wait long.{&1310}\par My suit's comm was muted, but I saw the light blink on my wrist indicating some incoming message over the frequency. I didn't need to hear it. That door opened and someone called out.{&1310}\par "Weir?"{&1310}\par For a second, I thought they wouldn't step inside. For a second, I felt that one chance slipping away before it even came.{&1310}\par Then she did.{&1310}\par "We-?"{&1310}\par I swung one arm wide and right into the throat of the woman who stepped inside the airlock. Her windpipe buckled and she choked on what was probably my name again, hands flying toward her neck on reflex. A pistol dropped to the floor.{&1310}\par My other hand was already moving, slamming the hilt of the knife into her skull while my wrist twisted back around from the throat strike and latched onto her coat, keeping her from falling over or stumbling back. {&1310}\par I needed a human shield for what came next.{&1310}\par I spun her around, switched hands, swept up the gun, and slipped that knife up against her throat all in one motion as fast as I could. Then I was pointing her pistol into the next room.{&1310}\par Someone was standing there. His eyes flashed wide and he had a rifle pointed low toward the deck. He hesitated for the same split second I did before deciding to shoot, but I already had my gun up. I burned a hole in his arm and one leg and he crumpled to the deck, losing his grip on the weapon.{&1310}\par My gun circle the room in an arc, but no one else was there. The woman in my arm was only dazed, but too heavy to drag around for long so I smacked the butt of the pistol into her head and threw her into the bulkhead. That guy on the floor was trying to pick his rifle back up, teeth bared while those holes in him bled out. I leapt forward and booted his head hard enough to knock him out. Then I was running toward the cockpit.{&1310}\par The door wasn't locked out or anything yet and opened easily. Another guy was waiting on the other side, though, sitting in one of the two pilot's chairs and twisted around to look at me coming in through the door. He reached for the sidearm on his coat instantly, but I fired first, clipping his shoulder. That gave me enough time to run up and whip the pistol across his face before he could get up, and I hit him again to put him out before throwing him out of that chair to the deck.{&1310}\par The cruiser was behind me now, and Riftwatch in front. Those three were down and out, but I hit the emergency button to lock out the cockpit door just in case and kicked the pilot in the back of the head again. Now I was in control. I'd only flown shuttles and boarding craft in simulators back at the academy, but it wasn't hard to get the autopilot to aim for the nearest docking back on the station. Another command in the console and aft thrusters were pushing me away from the enemy ship and back home.{&1310}\par So much for getting rescued.\cf2\f1 {&1310}\par }{&1310}

She didn't sound like she had cared much and I \i guess\i0  she hadn't said \i anything\i0  about a rescue so ... {&1310}\par I wanted to chew on my nails, or -- or squeeze my forehead or ... \i something\i0  to keep from flipping the fuck out at that pause that went on forever. I had to be professional. They must have been military. They \i sounded\i0  military. And I didn't want to be treated like just some dumb, unimportant civilian right now. I wanted out of this black, empty nothingness NOW.{&1310}\par That wait went on for minutes. It felt like hours. And I had this image of them ignoring me altogether while a desperate battle raged on inside my head.{&1310}\par "Hello?" I tried again, finally. \i Desperately\i0 . "Is anyone still there? This is Evelyn Weir and I need he-"{&1310}\par "Unit and designation, please."{&1310}\par Someone new. A new voice broke in on top of me, cutting me off. A man this time.{&1310}\par "Yes! I'm here -- I mean, this is Evelyn Weir and I need someone to come and get me. Situation ... critical?"{&1310}\par "Unit and designation, please," that voice repeated perfunctorily.{&1310}\par "What? I don't \i have\i0  any of those, I'm just ... \i stuck\i0  out here."{&1310}\par This guy wasn't yelling at me like the other one. I briefly wondered what the hell had even happened to her, but ...{&1310}\par \i God\i0 . T\i hat bitch probably \i0 did \i just blow me off.{&1310}\par \i0 Fuck, this guy better not too.{&1310}\par There was an annoyed sigh over the comm that I barely caught. Not a good sign. Then his voice again.{&1310}\par "What sector are in? Extractions are authorized for KIAs only."{&1310}\par "Well, I'm not dead!"{&1310}\par I don't know why I felt like yelling that at him, but I did.{&1310}\par Another sigh.{&1310}\par "Your name again?" he asked. I told him. Then I waited for another pause while the comm went quiet.{&1310}\par \i This had better not go like the last one or I'll ... I'll ...\i0 {&1310}\par I didn't know \i what \i0 I'd do. Nothing? What could I do? Probably nothing.{&1310}\par \i Fuck\i0 .{&1310}\par I waited again. I looked at the ship's hull and tried to put my other hand through to rub my forehead but only bumped into faceplate. I just needed someone to come get me! How hard could that be? I didn't even want to \i think\i0  about what it would mean to be left alone out here too long. Those creepy monsters back in the research tower were beginning to almost seem more appealing than -- than suffocating to death!{&1310}\par Or ... no. {&1310}\par No.{&1310}\par Getting eaten was still worse.{&1310}\par Yeah.{&1310}\par How had this leave gone from fretting over dad and failing out of the academy to debating what was the worst way to die anyways? {&1310}\par \i Poor life decisions, I guess.\i0 {&1310}\par Another salvo of pods overhead. I watched them without caring as much this second time. I mean, I \i cared\i0 , but I couldn't care actively right now. It's not like there was anything I could do it about anyways either. But I watched them. I watched them shoot towards the station with an uncomfortable, impatient detachment.{&1310}\par Then I started to think about those pods.{&1310}\par \i Really\i0  think.{&1310}\par I was too far away from the station to see, but those pods could only have meant fighting. An attack. Who? Pirates? There was no way pirates could have gotten this close and through all the regional defenses. Tau? Maybe, but Riftwatch was far from the borders of their space, and they were getting further away with each year. It wasn't a great target to open a new war on if that's what was happening.{&1310}\par I kept looking at those pods. Then I slowly came back around to where they had shot out. I was hugging an enemy ship. There was no way they were friendlies with everything I had already seen. Right?{&1310}\par How far away I'd flown from the station really started to dawn on me then. I'd been shouting into an open frequency, but who would be listening for it if they were under attack? \i Especially\i0  if everywhere else was even half as bad as what I'd seen in the research tower.{&1310}\par That woman had asked for an ID number. And the guy had wanted a unit and designation. Operational details.{&1310}\par Station military details wouldn't be broadcasting out this far if they were under attack ...{&1310}\par "Excuse me ... Miss Weir?"{&1310}\par Right?{&1310}\par "Miss Weir, are you still there?"{&1310}\par There was a change in tone. That was the first thing I noticed when that guy suddenly came back. He'd been monotone, text-book, professional -- the way an ops command comms officer might be? -- before. Now he was suddenly polite. Asking me questions instead of demanding answers in order to proceed, or quoting standard procedure.{&1310}\par A command deck comms officer would be someone maybe listening for chatter on short-range frequencies. A comms officer that was part of the attack.{&1310}\par "Miss Weir?"{&1310}\par "... yeah?"{&1310}\par "I asked if you could please tell me where you are so I can send someone to come get you."{&1310}\par \i Oh my god \i0\'85{&1310}\par All those thoughts suddenly coalesced into something almost \i comically\i0  tragic.{&1310}\par \i I'm talking to the enemy.\i0 {&1310}\par  How ...{&1310}\par What-{&1310}\par "Miss Weir?" that too-nice voice nagged me again. I'd been staring at the ship in shock and must've given him some long, awkward pauses.{&1310}\par "Wh-what?" I managed to stammer out.{&1310}\par They didn't know. They didn't know I knew.{&1310}\par "Is something wrong? Are you all right?"{&1310}\par "I, uhhh ..."{&1310}\par I glanced around at empty space, the station, and that hull around me like any of it would help me. It didn't.{&1310}\par "I'm fine."{&1310}\par "Good. Now I need you to activate your comm unit to broadcast your position so that we can send a team to come get you. Do you know how to do that?"{&1310}\par Do I know how to do that -- yes! Yes, I knew how to do that! But ... did I \i want\i0  to do that? I'd be waving a flag for them to see and come hunt me down and do whatever they were going to do to me. Kidnap me, I guess? Maybe that wasn't so bad compared to floating out here until I died or that ship finally moved. I'd be torn off the hull if it moved to velocity.{&1310}\par Christ, don't even think about that.{&1310}\par "Miss Weir?"{&1310}\par Fuck. {&1310}\par "Yes?"{&1310}\par "Can you broadcast your position for me, please?"{&1310}\par What choices did I have? And there was still the possibility that I was just being paranoid. What if he \i was\i0  with the station defense force? Or those weren't attackers at all but something completely different that I just had no idea about at all? It's not like I'd have been told anything important anyways.{&1310}\par I started moving a shaky hand toward where the transmitter would be on the side of my faceplate. They'd showed us them before -- back at the academy. There'd been brief SOS exercises in the introduction courses to zero-G training. {&1310}\par "Yes," I said, voice shaking just like my hand. I wondered if he noticed and could possibly guess what I was so scared of.{&1310}\par I found the manual switch, but hesitated. I hesitated long enough that I expected to hear that comms guy in my ear again, coaxing me to basically surrender myself to people I was fairly sure I didn't want to meet. I hesitated.{&1310}\par Then I turned it on.{&1310}\par "It's on," I told him, not entirely sure just what that would eventually mean.{&1310}\par "Great," he said. "Just hold tight and wait for pickup."{&1310}\par "Okay."{&1310}\par He closed the line. I guess that was it.{&1310}\par The silence wasn't so oppressive now. Now it was waiting for sound and motion that was making me nervous. But I did have a few minutes to think, at least. Or maybe that wasn't such a good thing because I just thought about those two men back on the station.{&1310}\par If those memories hadn't come trickling back, I wouldn't have worried so much at being captured or even cared. That comms officer hadn't sounded much like a pirate -- or what I expected one to sound like, I guess. Professional. Military. More like another Grand Admiral's fleet or a Tau invasion force, maybe. No, I would've just been taken prisoner and maybe held for a while or ransom. Scary, yes, but not terrifying since I wasn't important to any military. It might've even been a cool story to tell people like I had actually seen some real shit happen.{&1310}\par No. Mohawk and Beardface had been trying to kidnap me. \i Me\i0 . And they'd been willing to kill me if they couldn't get me out alive.{&1310}\par Why me? No idea. But it wasn't all just paranoid to make a connection between that attempted kidnapping{&47}murder and these people probably attacking the station right now.{&1310}\par Wait.{&1310}\par Wait.{&1310}\par Those people attacking the station ...{&1310}\par ... They couldn't just be looking for \i me\i0  ... could they?{&1310}\par No. No, that would be \i crazy \i0 ...{&1310}\par As crazy as two guys trying to kidnap me in the middle of the night?{&1310}\par No. It was \i way\i0  crazier than that even. Like, by a \i lot\i0 . Attacking the whole \i station\i0 ? A guarded military research station? No freaking way I was worth that much to \i anyone\i0 .{&1310}\par The thought made me laugh out of context. Wow, that would've been flattering in the weirdest fucking way.{&1310}\par Dad. They must have been after dad. Me? I wasn't important enough. Dr. Nolan Weir, though ... retired \i Admiral\i0  Dr. Nolan Weir, though ... powerful, ex-soldier-with-a-laundry-list-of-secret-accolades-for-super-secret-weapons-research Nolan Weir, though ...{&1310}\par Who knew what he was working on now. Or how important it could be. They'd use me to get to him. It made the only sense.{&1310}\par God ... if this was all just some infighting between Grand Admirals over competing science experiments, I'd --{&1310}\par \i What? There's nothing you can do.\i0 {&1310}\par What were a few dead scientists next to a Grand Admiral. Or even a few thousand.{&1310}\par I just kept floating there, with paralytic thoughts too big for my non-existent rank and clearance.{&1310}\par I guess I was going to disappoint dad for more than just flunking out.{&1310}\par After a little while, a shuttle swung down silently into view, bright forlights streaming across the hull of the ship behind me. I doubted it had come from the station or else it would've been shot down. But I waited. I waited while they scanned around in my general vicinity for whatever visual confirmation of a weird person floating beside their big ship that they needed. Then the light was on me.{&1310}\par "Weir, is that you?"{&1310}\par A voice came on inside my headpiece as that light slipped over finally and blinded me. I waved a hand back at them because what else was I going to do? Make a break for it? That channel was cleaner now, and the voice was from someone new. Some other woman, but she sounded kind of familiar. Not like the first one, but ... someone I ...{&1310}\par "Stay where you are."{&1310}\par Thrusters flared to life on either side of the shuttle and it went into a controlled spin, pivoting until the rear-entry hatch was facing me -- one of those silent ballet's of near-perfect motion you saw whenever you stopped to watch machines move in space.{&1310}\par "Push off and get inside," was the next command.{&1310}\par I said goodbye to my grip on the hull -- reluctantly, but only because panicked thoughts of floating off forever into the void were still all too fresh inside my head. That and this whole thing had a disturbed pit in my stomach.{&1310}\par I had to do something. I couldn't just let them take me hostage.{&1310}\par \i They might just kill me anyways\i0 . \i They tried to before\i0 .{&1310}\par How the hell had I even gotten out of there that time? I ... couldn't remember. But it wasn't going to happen again. I had nowhere to run out here.{&1310}\par Six months in advanced combat, incursion, and tactics training courses. What was it for if not for something like this? Life or death?{&1310}\par There was only one way out of here alive.{&1310}\par \i I'm not helpless\i0 . \i I'm \i0 not.{&1310}\par Nervousness fluttered around my guts as I drifted fast and not fast enough over to the open rear hatch of the shuttle. I could do this. I could -- because I'd be dead soon if I didn't. I tried to remember training. I tried to remember everything that had ever been yelled at me back at the academy. And I stuffed that anxiety down and tried to get control for once.{&1310}\par My boots were sucked down toward the floor almost as soon as I got inside the airlock and I almost forgot to stick them out so I landed on my feet. Deep breath. My palms were clammy inside the suit and I tried to rub them together through the material. The the airlock was closed and I could see the re-pressurizing light blink on overhead.{&1310}\par Deep breath.{&1310}\par They didn't know I knew they were after me, and that was the only advantage I had. So I had to strike first. Surprise. But I had to be fast. I couldn't let them get this shuttle back into that ship, and I was ninety-nine percent sure that was exactly where we were going once they had me in hand.{&1310}\par I hit the rleease button on my faceplate as soon as the air was almost normal again, holding my breath for a second while I tore off the headsleeve and moved toward the inner airlock door. That knife was still in my hand, but I wasn't ready to kill anyone just yet. Not if I didn't have to.{&1310}\par Deep breath.{&1310}\par There wasn't much room between the door and the bulkhead, but I squeezed back out of view while I waited for someone to open it. I'd probably only get one shot, and they probably had guns.{&1310}\par I didn't have to wait long.{&1310}\par My suit's comm was off, but I saw the light blink on my wrist indicating some incoming message over the frequency. I didn't need to hear it. That door opened and someone called out.{&1310}\par "Weir?"{&1310}\par For a second, I thought they wouldn't step inside. For a second, I felt that one chance slipping away before it even came.{&1310}\par Then she did.{&1310}\par "We-?"{&1310}\par I swung one arm wide and right into the throat of the woman who stepped inside the airlock. Her windpipe buckled and she choked on my name, hands flying toward her neck on reflex. A pistol clattered to the floor.{&1310}\par My other hand was already moving, slamming the hilt of the knife into her skull while my wrist twisted back around from the throat strike and latched onto her coat, keeping her from falling over or stumbling back. I needed a human shield for what came next.{&1310}\par I spun her around, switched hands, swept up the gun, and slipped that knife up against her throat all in one motion as fast as I could. Then I was pointing her pistol into the next room.{&1310}\par Someone was standing there. His eyes flashed wide and he had a rifle pointed low toward the deck. He hesitated for the same split second I did before deciding to shoot, but I already had my gun up. I burned a hole in his arm and one leg and he crumpled to the deck, losing his grip on the weapon.{&1310}\par My gun circle the room in an arc, but no one else was there. The woman in my arm was only dazed, but too heavy to drag around for long so I smacked the butt of the pistol into her head and threw her into the bulkhead. That guy on the floor was trying to pick his rifle back up, teeth bared while those holes in him bled out. I leapt forward and booted his head hard enough to knock him out. Then I was running toward the cockpit.{&1310}\par The door wasn't locked out or anything yet and opened easily. Another guy was waiting on the other side, though, sitting in one of the two pilot's chairs and twisted around to look at me coming in through the door. He reached for the sidearm on his coat instantly, but I fired first, clipping his shoulder. That gave me enough time to run up and whip the pistol across his face before he could get up, and I hit him again to put him out before throwing him out of that chair to the deck.{&1310}\par The cruiser was behind me now, and Riftwatch in front. Those three were down and out, but I hit the emergency button to lock out the cockpit door just in case and kicked the pilot in the back of the head again. Now I was in control. I'd only flown shuttles and boarding craft in simulators back at the academy, but it wasn't hard to get the autopilot to aim for the nearest docking back on the station. Another command in the console and aft thrusters were pushing me away from the enemy ship and back home.{&1310}\par So much for getting rescued.\cf2\f1 {&1310}\par }{&1310}

I'd been shouting into an open frequency, but who would be listening for it if they were under attack? \i Especially\i0  if everywhere else was even half as bad as what I'd seen in the research tower.{&1310}\par That woman had asked for an ID number. And the guy had wanted a unit and designation. Operational details.{&1310}\par Station military details wouldn't be broadcasting out this far if they were under attack ...{&1310}\par "Excuse me ... Miss Weir?"{&1310}\par Right?{&1310}\par "Miss Weir, are you still there?"{&1310}\par There was a change in tone. That was the first thing I noticed when that guy suddenly came back. He'd been monotone, text-book, professional -- the way an ops command comms officer might be? -- before. Now he was suddenly polite. Asking me questions instead of demanding answers in order to proceed, or quoting standard procedure.{&1310}\par A command deck comms officer would be someone maybe listening for chatter on short-range frequencies. A comms officer that was part of the attack.{&1310}\par "Miss Weir?"{&1310}\par "... yeah?"{&1310}\par "I asked if you could please tell me where you are so I can send someone to come get you."{&1310}\par \i Oh my god \i0\'85{&1310}\par All those thoughts suddenly coalesced into something almost \i comically\i0  tragic.{&1310}\par \i I'm talking to the enemy.\i0 {&1310}\par  How ...{&1310}\par What-{&1310}\par "Miss Weir?" that too-nice voice nagged me again. I'd been staring at the ship in shock and must've given him some long, awkward pauses.{&1310}\par "Wh-what?" I managed to stammer out.{&1310}\par They didn't know. They didn't know I knew.{&1310}\par "Is something wrong? Are you all right?"{&1310}\par "I, uhhh ..."{&1310}\par I glanced around at empty space, the station, and that hull around me like any of it would help me. It didn't.{&1310}\par "I'm fine."{&1310}\par "Good. Now I need you to activate your comm unit to broadcast your position so that we can send a team to come get you. Do you know how to do that?"{&1310}\par Do I know how to do that -- yes! Yes, I knew how to do that! But ... did I \i want\i0  to do that? I'd be waving a flag for them to see and come hunt me down and do whatever they were going to do to me. Kidnap me, I guess? Maybe that wasn't so bad compared to floating out here until I died or that ship finally moved. I'd be torn off the hull if it moved to velocity.{&1310}\par Christ, don't even think about that.{&1310}\par "Miss Weir?"{&1310}\par Fuck. {&1310}\par "Yes?"{&1310}\par "Can you broadcast your position for me, please?"{&1310}\par What choices did I have? And there was still the possibility that I was just being paranoid. What if he \i was\i0  with the station defense force? Or those weren't attackers at all but something completely different that I just had no idea about at all? It's not like I'd have been told anything important anyways.{&1310}\par I started moving a shaky hand toward where the transmitter would be on the side of my faceplate. They'd showed us them before -- back at the academy. There'd been brief SOS exercises in the introduction courses to zero-G training. {&1310}\par "Yes," I said, voice shaking just like my hand. I wondered if he noticed and could possibly guess what I was so scared of.{&1310}\par I found the manual switch, but hesitated. I hesitated long enough that I expected to hear that comms guy in my ear again, coaxing me to basically surrender myself to people I was fairly sure I didn't want to meet. I hesitated.{&1310}\par Then I turned it on.{&1310}\par "It's on," I told him, not entirely sure just what that would eventually mean.{&1310}\par "Great," he said. "Just hold tight and wait for pickup."{&1310}\par "Okay."{&1310}\par He closed the line. I guess that was it.{&1310}\par The silence wasn't so oppressive now. Now it was waiting for sound and motion that was making me nervous. But I did have a few minutes to think, at least. Or maybe that wasn't such a good thing because I just thought about those two men back on the station.{&1310}\par If those memories hadn't come trickling back, I wouldn't have worried so much at being captured or even cared. That comms officer hadn't sounded much like a pirate -- or what I expected one to sound like, I guess. Professional. Military. More like another Grand Admiral's fleet or a Tau invasion force, maybe. No, I would've just been taken prisoner and maybe held for a while or ransom. Scary, yes, but not terrifying since I wasn't important to any military. It might've even been a cool story to tell people like I had actually seen some real shit happen.{&1310}\par No. Mohawk and Beardface had been trying to kidnap me. \i Me\i0 . And they'd been willing to kill me if they couldn't get me out alive.{&1310}\par Why me? No idea. But it wasn't all just paranoid to make a connection between that attempted kidnapping{&47}murder and these people probably attacking the station right now.{&1310}\par Wait.{&1310}\par Wait.{&1310}\par Those people attacking the station ...{&1310}\par ... They couldn't just be looking for \i me\i0  ... could they?{&1310}\par No. No, that would be \i crazy \i0 ...{&1310}\par As crazy as two guys trying to kidnap me in the middle of the night?{&1310}\par No. It was \i way\i0  crazier than that even. Like, by a \i lot\i0 . Attacking the whole \i station\i0 ? A guarded military research station? No freaking way I was worth that much to \i anyone\i0 .{&1310}\par The thought made me laugh out of context. Wow, that would've been flattering in the weirdest fucking way.{&1310}\par Dad. They must have been after dad. Me? I wasn't important enough. Dr. Nolan Weir, though ... retired \i Admiral\i0  Dr. Nolan Weir, though ... powerful, ex-soldier-with-a-laundry-list-of-secret-accolades-for-super-secret-weapons-research Nolan Weir, though ...{&1310}\par Who knew what he was working on now. Or how important it could be. They'd use me to get to him. It made the only sense.{&1310}\par God ... if this was all just some infighting between Grand Admirals over competing science experiments, I'd --{&1310}\par \i What? There's nothing you can do.\i0 {&1310}\par What were a few dead scientists next to a Grand Admiral. Or even a few thousand.{&1310}\par I just kept floating there, with paralytic thoughts too big for my non-existent rank and clearance.{&1310}\par I guess I was going to disappoint dad for more than just flunking out.{&1310}\par After a little while, a shuttle swung down silently into view, bright forlights streaming across the hull of the ship behind me. I doubted it had come from the station or else it would've been shot down. But I waited. I waited while they scanned around in my general vicinity for whatever visual confirmation of a weird person floating beside their big ship that they needed. Then the light was on me.{&1310}\par "Weir, is that you?"{&1310}\par A voice came on inside my headpiece as that light slipped over finally and blinded me. I waved a hand back at them because what else was I going to do? Make a break for it? That channel was cleaner now, and the voice was from someone new. Some other woman, but she sounded kind of familiar. Not like the first one, but ... someone I ...{&1310}\par "Stay where you are."{&1310}\par Thrusters flared to life on either side of the shuttle and it went into a controlled spin, pivoting until the rear-entry hatch was facing me -- one of those silent ballet's of near-perfect motion you saw whenever you stopped to watch machines move in space.{&1310}\par "Push off and get inside," was the next command.{&1310}\par I said goodbye to my grip on the hull -- reluctantly, but only because panicked thoughts of floating off forever into the void were still all too fresh inside my head. That and this whole thing had a disturbed pit in my stomach.{&1310}\par I had to do something. I couldn't just let them take me hostage.{&1310}\par \i They might just kill me anyways\i0 . \i They tried to before\i0 .{&1310}\par How the hell had I even gotten out of there that time? I ... couldn't remember. But it wasn't going to happen again. I had nowhere to run out here.{&1310}\par Six months in advanced combat, incursion, and tactics training courses. What was it for if not for something like this? Life or death?{&1310}\par There was only one way out of here alive.{&1310}\par \i I'm not helpless\i0 . \i I'm \i0 not.{&1310}\par Nervousness fluttered around my guts as I drifted fast and not fast enough over to the open rear hatch of the shuttle. I could do this. I could -- because I'd be dead soon if I didn't. I tried to remember training. I tried to remember everything that had ever been yelled at me back at the academy. And I stuffed that anxiety down and tried to get control for once.{&1310}\par My boots were sucked down toward the floor almost as soon as I got inside the airlock and I almost forgot to stick them out so I landed on my feet. Deep breath. My palms were clammy inside the suit and I tried to rub them together through the material. The the airlock was closed and I could see the re-pressurizing light blink on overhead.{&1310}\par Deep breath.{&1310}\par They didn't know I knew they were after me, and that was the only advantage I had. So I had to strike first. Surprise. But I had to be fast. I couldn't let them get this shuttle back into that ship, and I was ninety-nine percent sure that was exactly where we were going once they had me in hand.{&1310}\par I hit the rleease button on my faceplate as soon as the air was almost normal again, holding my breath for a second while I tore off the headsleeve and moved toward the inner airlock door. That knife was still in my hand, but I wasn't ready to kill anyone just yet. Not if I didn't have to.{&1310}\par Deep breath.{&1310}\par There wasn't much room between the door and the bulkhead, but I squeezed back out of view while I waited for someone to open it. I'd probably only get one shot, and they probably had guns.{&1310}\par I didn't have to wait long.{&1310}\par My suit's comm was off, but I saw the light blink on my wrist indicating some incoming message over the frequency. I didn't need to hear it. That door opened and someone called out.{&1310}\par "Weir?"{&1310}\par For a second, I thought they wouldn't step inside. For a second, I felt that one chance slipping away before it even came.{&1310}\par Then she did.{&1310}\par "We-?"{&1310}\par I swung one arm wide and right into the throat of the woman who stepped inside the airlock. Her windpipe buckled and she choked on my name, hands flying toward her neck on reflex. A pistol clattered to the floor.{&1310}\par My other hand was already moving, slamming the hilt of the knife into her skull while my wrist twisted back around from the throat strike and latched onto her coat, keeping her from falling over or stumbling back. I needed a human shield for what came next.{&1310}\par I spun her around, switched hands, swept up the gun, and slipped that knife up against her throat all in one motion as fast as I could. Then I was pointing her pistol into the next room.{&1310}\par Someone was standing there. His eyes flashed wide and he had a rifle pointed low toward the deck. He hesitated for the same split second I did before deciding to shoot, but I already had my gun up. I burned a hole in his arm and one leg and he crumpled to the deck, losing his grip on the weapon.{&1310}\par My gun circle the room in an arc, but no one else was there. The woman in my arm was only dazed, but too heavy to drag around for long so I smacked the butt of the pistol into her head and threw her into the bulkhead. That guy on the floor was trying to pick his rifle back up, teeth bared while those holes in him bled out. I leapt forward and booted his head hard enough to knock him out. Then I was running toward the cockpit.{&1310}\par The door wasn't locked out or anything yet and opened easily. Another guy was waiting on the other side, though, sitting in one of the two pilot's chairs and twisted around to look at me coming in through the door. He reached for the sidearm on his coat instantly, but I fired first, clipping his shoulder. That gave me enough time to run up and whip the pistol across his face before he could get up, and I hit him again to put him out before throwing him out of that chair to the deck.{&1310}\par The cruiser was behind me now, and Riftwatch in front. Those three were down and out, but I hit the emergency button to lock out the cockpit door just in case and kicked the pilot in the back of the head again. Now I was in control. I'd only flown shuttles and boarding craft in simulators back at the academy, but it wasn't hard to get the autopilot to aim for the nearest docking back on the station. Another command in the console and aft thrusters were pushing me away from the enemy ship and back home.{&1310}\par So much for getting rescued.\cf2\f1 {&1310}\par }{&1310}

She didn't sound like she had cared much and I \i guess\i0  she hadn't said \i anything\i0  about a rescue so ... {&1310}\par I wanted to chew on my nails through the suit. I wanted to punch the hull and growl into the comm. I wanted to yell back at that woman -- \i anything\i0  to keep from flipping the fuck out at that pause that went on forever. I had to be professional. They must have been military. They \i sounded\i0  military. And I didn't want to be treated like just some dumb, unimportant civilian right now. I wanted out of this black, empty nothingness. {&1310}\par Right. Fucking. NOW.{&1310}\par That wait went on for minutes. It felt like hours. And I had this image of them ignoring me altogether while a desperate battle raged on for the station inside my head.{&1310}\par "Hello?" I tried again, finally. Desperately. "Is anyone still there? This is Evelyn Weir and I need someone to he-"{&1310}\par "Unit and designation, please."{&1310}\par Someone new. A new voice broke in on top of me, cutting me off. A man this time.{&1310}\par "Yes! I'm here -- I mean, this is Evelyn Weir and I need someone to come and get me. Situation ... critical?"{&1310}\par "Unit and designation, please," that voice repeated perfunctorily.{&1310}\par "What? I don't \i have\i0  any of those, I'm just ... \i stuck\i0  out here."{&1310}\par This guy wasn't yelling at me like the other one. I briefly wondered what the hell had even happened to her, but ...{&1310}\par \i God\i0 . T\i hat bitch probably \i0 did \i just blow me off.{&1310}\par \i0 Fuck, this guy better not too.{&1310}\par There was an annoyed sigh over the comm that I barely caught. Not a good sign. Then his voice again.{&1310}\par "What sector are you in? Extractions are authorized for KIAs only."{&1310}\par "Well, I'm not dead!"{&1310}\par I don't know why I felt like yelling that at him, but I did.{&1310}\par Another sigh, and I think he growled something about "auxiliaries" and "standard protocol" but I couldn't really tell.{&1310}\par "Give me your name again," he demanded with some of that frustration bleeding through. I ignored that and just told him. Then I waited for another pause while the comm went quiet.{&1310}\par \i This had better not go like the last one or I'll ... I'll ...\i0 {&1310}\par I'd what? Do what? Nothing? What could I do? Probably nothing.{&1310}\par \i Fuck\i0 .{&1310}\par I waited again. I looked at the ship's hull and tried to put my other hand through to rub my forehead but only bumped into faceplate. I just needed someone to come get me! How hard could that be? I didn't even want to \i think\i0  about what it would mean to be left alone out here too long. Those creepy monsters back in the research tower were beginning to almost seem more appealing than -- than suffocating to death!{&1310}\par Or ... no. {&1310}\par No.{&1310}\par Getting eaten was still worse.{&1310}\par Yeah.{&1310}\par I shook my head forlornly in my helmet.{&1310}\par ... How? \i How \i0 had this leave gone from fretting over dad and failing out of the academy to debating what was the worst way to die? {&1310}\par \i Poor life decisions, I guess.\i0 {&1310}\par Another salvo of pods overhead. I watched them without caring as much this second time. I mean, I \i cared\i0 , but I couldn't care actively right now. It's not like there was anything I could do about it. But I watched them. I watched them shoot towards the station with an uncomfortable, impatient detachment.{&1310}\par Those pods could only have meant fighting. An attack. Who? Pirates? There was no way pirates could have gotten this close and through all the regional defenses. Tau? Maybe, but Riftwatch was far from the borders of their space, and they were getting further away with each year. It wasn't a great target to open a new war on if that's what was happening. {&1310}\par I was hugging an enemy ship. I was pretty sure of that, at least.

I'd probably only get one shot, and they probably had guns.{&1310}\par I didn't have to wait long.{&1310}\par My suit's comm was off, but I saw the light blink on my wrist indicating some incoming message over the frequency. I didn't need to hear it. That door opened and someone called out.{&1310}\par "Weir?"{&1310}\par For a second, I thought they wouldn't step inside. For a second, I felt that one chance slipping away before it even came.{&1310}\par Then she did.{&1310}\par "We-?"{&1310}\par I swung one arm wide and right into the throat of the woman who stepped inside the airlock. Her windpipe buckled and she choked on my name, hands flying toward her neck on reflex. A pistol clattered to the floor.{&1310}\par My other hand was already moving, slamming the hilt of the knife into her skull while my wrist twisted back around from the throat strike and latched onto her coat, keeping her from falling over or stumbling back. I needed a human shield for what came next.{&1310}\par I spun her around, switched hands, swept up the gun, and slipped that knife up against her throat all in one motion as fast as I could. Then I was pointing her pistol into the next room.{&1310}\par Someone was standing there. His eyes flashed wide and he had a rifle pointed low toward the deck. He hesitated for the same split second I did before deciding to shoot, but I already had my gun up. I burned a hole in his arm and one leg and he crumpled to the deck, losing his grip on the weapon.{&1310}\par My gun circle the room in an arc, but no one else was there. The woman in my arm was only dazed, but too heavy to drag around for long so I smacked the butt of the pistol into her head and threw her into the bulkhead. That guy on the floor was trying to pick his rifle back up, teeth bared while those holes in him bled out. I leapt forward and booted his head hard enough to knock him out. Then I was running toward the cockpit.{&1310}\par The door wasn't locked out or anything yet and opened easily. Another guy was waiting on the other side, though, sitting in one of the two pilot's chairs and twisted around to look at me coming in through the door. He reached for the sidearm on his coat instantly, but I fired first, clipping his shoulder. That gave me enough time to run up and whip the pistol across his face before he could get up, and I hit him again to put him out before throwing him out of that chair to the deck.{&1310}\par The cruiser was behind me now, and Riftwatch in front. Those three were down and out, but I hit the emergency button to lock out the cockpit door just in case and kicked the pilot in the back of the head again. Now I was in control. I'd only flown shuttles and boarding craft in simulators back at the academy, but it wasn't hard to get the autopilot to aim for the nearest docking back on the station. Another command in the console and aft thrusters were pushing me away from the enemy ship and back home.{&1310}\par So much for getting rescued.\cf2\f1 {&1310}\par }{&1310}

She didn't sound like she had cared much and I \i guess\i0  she hadn't said \i anything\i0  about a rescue so ... {&1310}\par I wanted to chew on my nails through the suit. I wanted to punch the hull and growl into the comm. I wanted to yell back at that woman -- \i anything\i0  to keep from flipping the fuck out at that pause that went on forever. I had to be professional. They must have been military. They \i sounded\i0  military. And I didn't want to be treated like just some dumb, unimportant civilian right now. I wanted out of this black, empty nothingness. {&1310}\par Right. Fucking. NOW.{&1310}\par That wait went on for minutes. It felt like hours. And I had this image of them ignoring me altogether while a desperate battle raged on for the station inside my head.{&1310}\par "Hello?" I tried again, finally. Desperately. "Is anyone still there? This is Evelyn Weir and I need someone to he-"{&1310}\par "Unit and designation, please."{&1310}\par Someone new. A new voice broke in on top of me, cutting me off. A man this time.{&1310}\par "Yes! I'm here -- I mean, this is Evelyn Weir and I need someone to come and get me. Situation ... critical?"{&1310}\par "Unit and designation, please," that voice repeated perfunctorily.{&1310}\par "What? I don't \i have\i0  any of those, I'm just ... \i stuck\i0  out here."{&1310}\par This guy wasn't yelling at me like the other one. I briefly wondered what the hell had even happened to her, but ...{&1310}\par \i God\i0 . T\i hat bitch probably \i0 did \i just blow me off.{&1310}\par \i0 Fuck, this guy better not too.{&1310}\par There was an annoyed sigh over the comm that I barely caught. Not a good sign. Then his voice again.{&1310}\par "What sector are you in? Extractions are authorized for KIAs only."{&1310}\par "Well, I'm not dead!"{&1310}\par I don't know why I felt like yelling that at him, but I did.{&1310}\par Another sigh, and I think he growled something about "auxiliaries" and "standard protocol" but I couldn't really tell.{&1310}\par "Give me your name again," he demanded with some of that frustration bleeding through. I ignored that and just told him. Then I waited for another pause while the comm went quiet.{&1310}\par \i This had better not go like the last one or I'll ... I'll ...\i0 {&1310}\par I'd what? Do what? Nothing? What could I do? Probably nothing.{&1310}\par \i Fuck\i0 .{&1310}\par I waited again. I looked at the ship's hull and tried to put my other hand through to rub my forehead but only bumped into faceplate. I just needed someone to come get me! How hard could that be? I didn't even want to \i think\i0  about what it would mean to be left alone out here too long. Those creepy monsters back in the research tower were beginning to almost seem more appealing than -- than suffocating to death!{&1310}\par Or ... no. {&1310}\par No.{&1310}\par Getting eaten was still worse.{&1310}\par Yeah.{&1310}\par I shook my head forlornly in my helmet.{&1310}\par ... How? \i How \i0 had this leave gone from fretting over dad and failing out of the academy to debating what was the worst way to die? {&1310}\par \i Poor life decisions, I guess.\i0 {&1310}\par Another salvo of pods overhead. I watched them without caring as much this second time. I mean, I \i cared\i0 , but I couldn't care actively right now. It's not like there was anything I could do about it. But I watched them. I watched them shoot towards the station with an uncomfortable, impatient detachment.{&1310}\par Those pods could only have meant fighting. An attack. Who? Pirates? There was no way pirates could have gotten this close and through all the regional defenses. Tau? Maybe, but Riftwatch was far from the borders of their space, and they were getting further away with each year. It wasn't a great target to open a new war on if that's what was happening. {&1310}\par I was hugging an enemy ship. I was pretty sure of that, at least. How far away I'd flown from the station really started to dawn on me then. I'd been shouting into an open frequency, but who would be listening for it if they were under attack? \i Especially\i0  if the rest of the station was even half as bad as what I'd seen in the research tower.{&1310}\par "Excuse me ... Miss Weir?"{&1310}\par That woman had asked for an ID number. And the guy had wanted a unit and designation. Operational details.{&1310}\par Station military details wouldn't be broadcasting out this far if they were under attack ...{&1310}\par Right?{&1310}\par "Miss Weir, are you still there?"{&1310}\par Change in tone. That was the first thing I noticed when that guy suddenly came back. He'd been monotone, text-book, frustrated with me, but professional otherwise -- the way an ops command comms officer might be? -- before. Now he was suddenly polite. Asking me questions instead of demanding answers in order to proceed, or quoting standard procedure.{&1310}\par A command deck comms officer would be someone maybe listening for chatter on short-range frequencies. A comms officer that was part of the attack. {&1310}\par Dead comms. Extractions for KIAs. Sectors.{&1310}\par "Miss Weir?"{&1310}\par "... yeah?"{&1310}\par "I asked if you could please tell me where you are so I can send someone to come get you."{&1310}\par \i Oh god \i0\'85{&1310}\par All those thoughts suddenly coalesced into something almost \i comically\i0  tragic.{&1310}\par \i I'm talking to the enemy.\i0 {&1310}\par  How ...{&1310}\par What-{&1310}\par "Miss Weir?" that too-nice voice nagged me again. I'd been staring at the ship in shock and must've given him some long, awkward pause.{&1310}\par "Wh-what?" I managed to stammer out.{&1310}\par They didn't know. They didn't know I knew.{&1310}\par "Is something wrong? Are you all right?"{&1310}\par "I, um ..."{&1310}\par I glanced around at empty space, the station, and that hull around me like any of it would help me. It didn't.{&1310}\par "I'm fine."{&1310}\par "Good. Now I need you to activate your comm unit to broadcast your position so that we can send a team to come get you. Do you know how to do that?"{&1310}\par {&1310}\par Do I know how to do that -- yes! Yes, I knew how to do that! But ... did I \i want\i0  to do that? I'd be waving a flag for them to see and come hunt me down and do whatever they were going to do to me. Kidnap me, I guess? Maybe that wasn't so bad compared to floating out here until I died or that ship finally moved. I'd be torn off the hull if it moved to velocity.{&1310}\par Christ, don't even think about that.{&1310}\par "Miss Weir?"{&1310}\par Fuck. {&1310}\par "Yes?"{&1310}\par "Can you broadcast your position for me, please?"{&1310}\par What choices did I have? And there was still the possibility that I was just being paranoid. What if he \i was\i0  with the station defense force? Or those weren't attackers at all but something completely different that I just had no idea about at all? It's not like I'd have been told anything important anyways.{&1310}\par I started moving a shaky hand toward where the transmitter would be on the side of my faceplate. They'd showed us them before -- back at the academy. There'd been brief SOS exercises in the introduction courses to zero-G training. {&1310}\par "Yes," I said, voice shaking just like my hand. I wondered if he noticed and could possibly guess what I was so scared of.{&1310}\par I found the manual switch, but hesitated. I hesitated long enough that I expected to hear that comms guy in my ear again, coaxing me to basically surrender myself to people I was fairly sure I didn't want to meet. I hesitated.{&1310}\par Then I turned it on.{&1310}\par "It's on," I told him, not entirely sure just what that would eventually mean.{&1310}\par "Great," he said. "Just hold tight and wait for pickup."{&1310}\par "Okay."{&1310}\par He closed the line. I guess that was it.{&1310}\par The silence wasn't so oppressive now. Now it was waiting for sound and motion that was making me nervous. But I did have a few minutes to think, at least. Or maybe that wasn't such a good thing because I just thought about those two men back on the station.{&1310}\par If those memories hadn't come trickling back, I wouldn't have worried so much at being captured or even cared. That comms officer hadn't sounded much like a pirate -- or what I expected one to sound like, I guess. Professional. Military. More like another Grand Admiral's fleet or a Tau invasion force, maybe. No, I would've just been taken prisoner and maybe held for a while or ransom. Scary, yes, but not terrifying since I wasn't important to any military. It might've even been a cool story to tell people like I had actually seen some real shit happen.{&1310}\par No. Mohawk and Beardface had been trying to kidnap me. \i Me\i0 . And they'd been willing to kill me if they couldn't get me out alive.{&1310}\par Why me? No idea. But it wasn't all just paranoid to make a connection between that attempted kidnapping{&47}murder and these people probably attacking the station right now.{&1310}\par Wait.{&1310}\par Wait.{&1310}\par Those people attacking the station ...{&1310}\par ... They couldn't just be looking for \i me\i0  ... could they?{&1310}\par No. No, that would be \i crazy \i0 ...{&1310}\par As crazy as two guys trying to kidnap me in the middle of the night?{&1310}\par No. It was \i way\i0  crazier than that even. Like, by a \i lot\i0 . Attacking the whole \i station\i0 ? A guarded military research station? No freaking way I was worth that much to \i anyone\i0 .{&1310}\par The thought made me laugh out of context. Wow, that would've been flattering in the weirdest fucking way.{&1310}\par Dad. They must have been after dad. Me? I wasn't important enough. Dr. Nolan Weir, though ... retired \i Admiral\i0  Dr. Nolan Weir, though ... powerful, ex-soldier-with-a-laundry-list-of-secret-accolades-for-super-secret-weapons-research Nolan Weir, though ...{&1310}\par Who knew what he was working on now. Or how important it could be. They'd use me to get to him. It made the only sense.{&1310}\par God ... if this was all just some infighting between Grand Admirals over competing science experiments, I'd --{&1310}\par \i What? There's nothing you can do.\i0 {&1310}\par What were a few dead scientists next to a Grand Admiral. Or even a few thousand.{&1310}\par I just kept floating there, with paralytic thoughts too big for my non-existent rank and clearance.{&1310}\par I guess I was going to disappoint dad for more than just flunking out.{&1310}\par After a little while, a shuttle swung down silently into view, bright forlights streaming across the hull of the ship behind me. I doubted it had come from the station or else it would've been shot down. But I waited. I waited while they scanned around in my general vicinity for whatever visual confirmation of a weird person floating beside their big ship that they needed. Then the light was on me.{&1310}\par "Weir, is that you?"{&1310}\par A voice came on inside my headpiece as that light slipped over finally and blinded me. I waved a hand back at them because what else was I going to do? Make a break for it? That channel was cleaner now, and the voice was from someone new. Some other woman, but she sounded kind of familiar. Not like the first one, but ... someone I ...{&1310}\par "Stay where you are."{&1310}\par Thrusters flared to life on either side of the shuttle and it went into a controlled spin, pivoting until the rear-entry hatch was facing me -- one of those silent ballet's of near-perfect motion you saw whenever you stopped to watch machines move in space.{&1310}\par "Push off and get inside," was the next command.{&1310}\par I said goodbye to my grip on the hull -- reluctantly, but only because panicked thoughts of floating off forever into the void were still all too fresh inside my head. That and this whole thing had a disturbed pit in my stomach.{&1310}\par I had to do something. I couldn't just let them take me hostage.{&1310}\par \i They might just kill me anyways\i0 . \i They tried to before\i0 .{&1310}\par How the hell had I even gotten out of there that time? I ... couldn't remember. But it wasn't going to happen again. I had nowhere to run out here.{&1310}\par Six months in advanced combat, incursion, and tactics training courses. What was it for if not for something like this? Life or death?{&1310}\par There was only one way out of here alive.{&1310}\par \i I'm not helpless\i0 . \i I'm \i0 not.{&1310}\par Nervousness fluttered around my guts as I drifted fast and not fast enough over to the open rear hatch of the shuttle. I could do this. I could -- because I'd be dead soon if I didn't. I tried to remember training. I tried to remember everything that had ever been yelled at me back at the academy. And I stuffed that anxiety down and tried to get control for once.{&1310}\par My boots were sucked down toward the floor almost as soon as I got inside the airlock and I almost forgot to stick them out so I landed on my feet. Deep breath. My palms were clammy inside the suit and I tried to rub them together through the material. The the airlock was closed and I could see the re-pressurizing light blink on overhead.{&1310}\par Deep breath.{&1310}\par They didn't know I knew they were after me, and that was the only advantage I had. So I had to strike first. Surprise. But I had to be fast. I couldn't let them get this shuttle back into that ship, and I was ninety-nine percent sure that was exactly where we were going once they had me in hand.{&1310}\par I hit the release button on my faceplate as soon as the air was almost normal again, holding my breath for a second while I tore off the headsleeve and moved toward the inner airlock door. That knife was still in my hand, but I wasn't ready to kill anyone just yet. Not if I didn't have to.{&1310}\par Deep breath.{&1310}\par There wasn't much room between the door and the bulkhead, but I squeezed back out of view while I waited for someone to open it.

I'd be waving a flag for them to see and come hunt me down and do whatever they were going to do to me. Kidnap me, I guess? Maybe that wasn't so bad compared to floating out here until I died or that ship finally moved. I'd be torn off the hull if it moved to velocity.{&1310}\par Christ, don't even think about that.{&1310}\par "Miss Weir?"{&1310}\par Fuck. {&1310}\par "Yes?"{&1310}\par "Can you broadcast your position for me, please?"{&1310}\par What choices did I have? And there was still the possibility that I was just being paranoid. What if he \i was\i0  with the station defense force? Or those weren't attackers at all but something completely different that I just had no idea about at all? It's not like I'd have been told anything important anyways.{&1310}\par I started moving a shaky hand toward where the transmitter would be on the side of my faceplate. They'd showed us them before -- back at the academy. There'd been brief SOS exercises in the introduction courses to zero-G training. {&1310}\par "Yes," I said, voice shaking just like my hand. I wondered if he noticed and could possibly guess what I was so scared of.{&1310}\par I found the manual switch, but hesitated. I hesitated long enough that I expected to hear that comms guy in my ear again, coaxing me to basically surrender myself to people I was fairly sure I didn't want to meet. I hesitated.{&1310}\par Then I turned it on.{&1310}\par "It's on," I told him, not entirely sure just what that would eventually mean.{&1310}\par "Great," he said. "Just hold tight and wait for pickup."{&1310}\par "Okay."{&1310}\par He closed the line. I guess that was it.{&1310}\par The silence wasn't so oppressive now. Now it was waiting for sound and motion that was making me nervous. But I did have a few minutes to think, at least. Or maybe that wasn't such a good thing because I just thought about those two men back on the station.{&1310}\par If those memories hadn't come trickling back, I wouldn't have worried so much at being captured or even cared. That comms officer hadn't sounded much like a pirate -- or what I expected one to sound like, I guess. Professional. Military. More like another Grand Admiral's fleet or a Tau invasion force, maybe. No, I would've just been taken prisoner and maybe held for a while or ransom. Scary, yes, but not terrifying since I wasn't important to any military. It might've even been a cool story to tell people like I had actually seen some real shit happen.{&1310}\par No. Mohawk and Beardface had been trying to kidnap me. \i Me\i0 . And they'd been willing to kill me if they couldn't get me out alive.{&1310}\par Why me? No idea. But it wasn't all just paranoid to make a connection between that attempted kidnapping{&47}murder and these people probably attacking the station right now.{&1310}\par Wait.{&1310}\par Wait.{&1310}\par Those people attacking the station ...{&1310}\par ... They couldn't just be looking for \i me\i0  ... could they?{&1310}\par No. No, that would be \i crazy \i0 ...{&1310}\par As crazy as two guys trying to kidnap me in the middle of the night?{&1310}\par No. It was \i way\i0  crazier than that even. Like, by a \i lot\i0 . Attacking the whole \i station\i0 ? A guarded military research station? No freaking way I was worth that much to \i anyone\i0 .{&1310}\par The thought made me laugh out of context. Wow, that would've been flattering in the weirdest fucking way.{&1310}\par Dad. They must have been after dad. Me? I wasn't important enough. Dr. Nolan Weir, though ... retired \i Admiral\i0  Dr. Nolan Weir, though ... powerful, ex-soldier-with-a-laundry-list-of-secret-accolades-for-super-secret-weapons-research Nolan Weir, though ...{&1310}\par Who knew what he was working on now. Or how important it could be. They'd use me to get to him. It made the only sense.{&1310}\par God ... if this was all just some infighting between Grand Admirals over competing science experiments, I'd --{&1310}\par \i What? There's nothing you can do.\i0 {&1310}\par What were a few dead scientists next to a Grand Admiral. Or even a few thousand.{&1310}\par I just kept floating there, with paralytic thoughts too big for my non-existent rank and clearance.{&1310}\par I guess I was going to disappoint dad for more than just flunking out.{&1310}\par After a little while, a shuttle swung down silently into view, bright forlights streaming across the hull of the ship behind me. I doubted it had come from the station or else it would've been shot down. But I waited. I waited while they scanned around in my general vicinity for whatever visual confirmation of a weird person floating beside their big ship that they needed. Then the light was on me.{&1310}\par "Weir, is that you?"{&1310}\par A voice came on inside my headpiece as that light slipped over finally and blinded me. I waved a hand back at them because what else was I going to do? Make a break for it? That channel was cleaner now, and the voice was from someone new. Some other woman, but she sounded kind of familiar. Not like the first one, but ... someone I ...{&1310}\par "Stay where you are."{&1310}\par Thrusters flared to life on either side of the shuttle and it went into a controlled spin, pivoting until the rear-entry hatch was facing me -- one of those silent ballet's of near-perfect motion you saw whenever you stopped to watch machines move in space.{&1310}\par "Push off and get inside," was the next command.{&1310}\par I said goodbye to my grip on the hull -- reluctantly, but only because panicked thoughts of floating off forever into the void were still all too fresh inside my head. That and this whole thing had a disturbed pit in my stomach.{&1310}\par I had to do something. I couldn't just let them take me hostage.{&1310}\par \i They might just kill me anyways\i0 . \i They tried to before\i0 .{&1310}\par How the hell had I even gotten out of there that time? I ... couldn't remember. But it wasn't going to happen again. I had nowhere to run out here.{&1310}\par Six months in advanced combat, incursion, and tactics training courses. What was it for if not for something like this? Life or death?{&1310}\par There was only one way out of here alive.{&1310}\par \i I'm not helpless\i0 . \i I'm \i0 not.{&1310}\par Nervousness fluttered around my guts as I drifted fast and not fast enough over to the open rear hatch of the shuttle. I could do this. I could -- because I'd be dead soon if I didn't. I tried to remember training. I tried to remember everything that had ever been yelled at me back at the academy. And I stuffed that anxiety down and tried to get control for once.{&1310}\par My boots were sucked down toward the floor almost as soon as I got inside the airlock and I almost forgot to stick them out so I landed on my feet. Deep breath. My palms were clammy inside the suit and I tried to rub them together through the material. The the airlock was closed and I could see the re-pressurizing light blink on overhead.{&1310}\par Deep breath.{&1310}\par They didn't know I knew they were after me, and that was the only advantage I had. So I had to strike first. Surprise. But I had to be fast. I couldn't let them get this shuttle back into that ship, and I was ninety-nine percent sure that was exactly where we were going once they had me in hand.{&1310}\par I hit the release button on my faceplate as soon as the air was almost normal again, holding my breath for a second while I tore off the headsleeve and moved toward the inner airlock door. That knife was still in my hand, but I wasn't ready to kill anyone just yet. Not if I didn't have to.{&1310}\par Deep breath.{&1310}\par There wasn't much room between the door and the bulkhead, but I squeezed back out of view while I waited for someone to open it. I'd probably only get one shot, and they probably had guns.{&1310}\par I didn't have to wait long.{&1310}\par My suit's comm was off, but I saw the light blink on my wrist indicating some incoming message over the frequency. I didn't need to hear it. That door opened and someone called out.{&1310}\par "Weir?"{&1310}\par For a second, I thought they wouldn't step inside. For a second, I felt that one chance slipping away before it even came.{&1310}\par Then she did.{&1310}\par "We-?"{&1310}\par I swung one arm wide and right into the throat of the woman who stepped inside the airlock. Her windpipe buckled and she choked on my name, hands flying toward her neck on reflex. A pistol clattered to the floor.{&1310}\par My other hand was already moving, slamming the hilt of the knife into her skull while my wrist twisted back around from the throat strike and latched onto her coat, keeping her from falling over or stumbling back. I needed a human shield for what came next.{&1310}\par I spun her around, switched hands, swept up the gun, and slipped that knife up against her throat all in one motion as fast as I could. Then I was pointing her pistol into the next room.{&1310}\par Someone was standing there. His eyes flashed wide and he had a rifle pointed low toward the deck. He hesitated for the same split second I did before deciding to shoot, but I already had my gun up. I burned a hole in his arm and one leg and he crumpled to the deck, losing his grip on the weapon.{&1310}\par My gun circle the room in an arc, but no one else was there. The woman in my arm was only dazed, but too heavy to drag around for long so I smacked the butt of the pistol into her head and threw her into the bulkhead. That guy on the floor was trying to pick his rifle back up, teeth bared while those holes in him bled out. I leapt forward and booted his head hard enough to knock him out. Then I was running toward the cockpit.{&1310}\par The door wasn't locked out or anything yet and opened easily. Another guy was waiting on the other side, though, sitting in one of the two pilot's chairs and twisted around to look at me coming in through the door. He reached for the sidearm on his coat instantly, but I fired first, clipping his shoulder. That gave me enough time to run up and whip the pistol across his face before he could get up, and I hit him again to put him out before throwing him out of that chair to the deck.{&1310}\par The cruiser was behind me now, and Riftwatch in front. Those three were down and out, but I hit the emergency button to lock out the cockpit door just in case and kicked the pilot in the back of the head again. Now I was in control. I'd only flown shuttles and boarding craft in simulators back at the academy, but it wasn't hard to get the autopilot to aim for the nearest docking back on the station. Another command in the console and aft thrusters were pushing me away from the enemy ship and back home.{&1310}\par So much for getting rescued.\cf2\f1 {&1310}\par }{&1310}
