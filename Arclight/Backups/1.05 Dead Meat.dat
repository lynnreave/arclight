And my legs gave out.{&1310}\par Even before the rush and gargling scream. I collapsed down, that thing whipping one of its crooked, impossible limbs into the wall and slicing a hole right through it. I heard the metal rend, and my heart tried to burst -- but I flipped over onto my stomach first.{&1310}\par The pulse rifle slipped out of my hands and flew away loudly into the dark. I flung a mewling sound of self-pity and despair flung from my mouth along after it.{&1310}\par Another wet howl echoed in the corridor. I threw myself up to my feet, flying, stumbling around that thing and the bodies ahead. Instinct, and reflex. My own body sliced up into pieces flashed in my mind so suddenly I forgot I was already moving. {&1310}\par Something else snapped in just over my back. And again into the ground where my feet had been.{&1310}\par I hit another corner in the bulkheads -- a side hallway I could barely make out except for the shift in the dim, red panels on the floor and ceiling. I lashed out and caught it with both hands, slipping on dead people's blood on the deck. That took me clean off my feet again, but not on down the hall. I yanked myself over into the other hallway. That thing slashed in right behind.{&1310}\par It screamed at me. That fleshy, gaping-head scream filled with something worse than teeth. I tripped up a few desperate steps, blood slick on my shoes. Those emergency lights didn't do anything for the hallway but outline the walls, and they were out in some places. Covered up too, maybe. By bodies, blood, or something else -- I couldn't tell for sure. There was only red-tinged black ahead and that thing behind.{&1310}\par I charged the other end. Hard. But I didn't get far. There \i were\i0  more bodies on the floor. And I had the fleeting thought, as I slid wildly ahead into another wall, that there could have been even more of those things up ahead of me.{&1310}\par When I came back up, that thing was screaming right in my face.{&1310}\par It slashed something at me. My arm sliced open through the sleeve and whatever it was punched a hole in the deck. I remembered the dead marine all jacked up on the floor with his guts falling out as I spun around on my back in the blood on the ground, and both feet went flying. One managed to hit the thing somewhere.{&1310}\par It hit me again. Something blunt this time because it sent me sliding away down the hall. I slapped the deck and leapt back up to my feet, stumbled a few steps, and slipped into a door. It was shut tight.{&1310}\par I froze for one, terrible moment. That warbling started up again behind me, charging. Maybe it had never stopped. Everything went to cold, shivering ice again, and I tried to scream. But I just didn't have it in me.{&1310}\par Then I saw it. The door was open. {&1310}\par Just a little.{&1310}\par I didn't care. I flung myself at the hole without a second thought except for the murderous howl flying at me fast from behind. And got stuck partway through.{&1310}\par Maybe I looked back. The thing was just a big, black splotch against the blotted, dull lights. It was a horrible mistake. Pretty soon, it doubled up on itself and filled out the whole corridor with that black that was somehow void.{&1310}\par I sucked in, squeezed, and screamed. Hands scrabbling on both sides, I smeared blood all over the doors. Panic reached a fever pitch as my fingers slid all over. I didn't look back again. Couldn't. Even as it gargled another vicious shriek at me, I clawed my way through the door. It swiped that razor-sharp something for my head. {&1310}\par And then I was through.{&1310}\par I got halfway down the next corridor before I realized it, though.{&1310}\par Everything swirled around me in a blinding rush of black and red. I never stopped - barely slowed. But that thing was still caught in the door. I didn't look back, but I could hear it slashing at metal and screaming at me, trying to get through.{&1310}\par  I glanced down at my arm as I stumbled on -- at the blood dribbling down the length of it. It shook so hard it was hard to see in the dim light. And I had no idea how bad it was. But I couldn't care just then anyways. I just kept on running in the dark.{&1310}\par And that was when the gravity decided to go out, sending me tumbling wildly into the air.{&1310}\par I heard the subsystem die as my feet took off from the ground and my whole body kept careening forward. It died loudly with the emergency backups and I flailed desperately to catch myself on something -- \i anything\i0 ! It just sent me spinning. Something jumped up from the deck ahead of me and I screamed right before I slammed right into it.{&1310}\par Limbs tangled in mine and I punched, kicked, and shoved with every part of my body until it was away from me. We both hit the bulkhead, and I saw it was another headless corpse that I flung desperately away. The force of the kick sent me flying hard backward, though. I smacked the bulkhead with my head and saw stars. It was the brightest the world had been in what felt like forever.{&1310}\par The rest of it came back. {&1310}\par Slowly.{&1310}\par I had to get off this deck, was the languid thought in my head as I drift, slowing down, in the black. That thing was back there and it was going to kill me if I didn't get out of the tower and back to the habitats. But I had no idea where I even was.{&1310}\par There were more of those things too. I could hear them. Those creepy, piercing shrieks out of the dark that echoed around the corridor. Was anyone even still alive? What if the rest of the tower was just as bad as this one? What if everyone on Riftwatch was already dead? Huh? What \i then\i0 ?!{&1310}\par If that dark didn't get me killed, my eyes would. I couldn't keep tears from blinding them as I floated, feeling a hand to my throbbing head.{&1310}\par Eventually, my shoulder hit the deck -- what I \i thought\i0  was the deck -- and I had the presence of mind back to grab on to it. Any indent or rivulet in the metal. I scraped and scratched with my fingertips until I stopped myself from floating away again. Then I let go and swiped at my eyes.{&1310}\par \i Come on\i0 . MOVE.{&1310}\par It wasn't like that thing had gone quiet. I could hear metal rending way back behind me and echoing ahead. I had to keep moving. I had to hide and find a way off this deck.{&1310}\par I started to swim forward, lashing out with my blood-stained hands for anything along the way and pulling myself through the black and low, red light. My chest shook -- with sobs, I realized. And I couldn't make it stop. Fuck it, I \i tried\i0  ... {&1310}\par I hit another door. Spun myself around. And grabbed at the crack between them. I started prying them open, still wracked with shaking sobs that wouldn't go away. Just enough to peek into the next passageway.{&1310}\par Something leapt at my face as soon as I did.{&1310}\par That skin-ripping scream. I choked on my tongue, or else I would have screamed too. It slashed at me through the crack. Something caught in my side, and even more blood was spilling into the air.{&1310}\par I flung back. It howled, rearing and clawing at the door like some kind of rabid animal. And it wasn't alone. There was a whole other cabin out there. Not another corridor. What must have been a dozen of those things were suddenly flying and ripping at the metal between them and me.{&1310}\par The door bent, huge dents popping back in places. That warbling scream turned into a crescendo, making my ears bleed. I screamed too this time.{&1310}\par I guess I was dead. I saw Tess and dad in my head, bleeding out on the floor and torn apart. Bertram too. I saw all those bodies, in pieces all over everything. And I saw myself. The station ... it was just one big, bloody tomb for all of us.{&1310}\par My body floated over, bawling in the dark while those things tore open the door from the other side. If only Morisant and everyone else back at the academy could see me now. They'd know they'd been right about me. I was weak ... and useless, and ... I was about to get my guts ripped out of me in the worst way possible. I bet no one would even remember me once I was gone.{&1310}\par I might have tried to run, but I would've gotten nowhere hanging there in midair. One behind, a dozen in front of me- {&1310}\par My hand found the gun in my jacket pocket. {&1310}\par It was still there. I'd lost the rifle like a clumsy, fucking idiot but ... I still had the pistol. And I stabbed it out at those things without another thought.{&1310}\par I yanked on the trigger, and ...{&1310}\par Nothing.{&1310}\par Again.{&1310}\par Nothing.{&1310}\par That empty clicking sounded like deafening despair to my ears. I stared at the pistol while razored limbs whipped out in a frenzied mass of tentacles at the door. Howling and snarling and teeth like claws snapping bone. Metal groaned, and howled too. It started to finally come apart altogether.{&1310}\par I think I screamed again, shrieking fury and helplessness at that whole bloody mess. But no sound came out this time. Or they just drowned me out. I might have just thrown the pistol at them too. Holes appeared all over the door. It was already bent out of shape, folding in at me. It started to give way.{&1310}\par There were so many of them. I thought that with hopeless despair, and gave up. I just lay there, floating in air in the dark and tried not to think about how it would feel to get torn apart. And failed.{&1310}\par Then something grabbed my hand.{&1310}\par It dragged me to the floor. I screamed, and it spun me back around. {&1310}\par Nothing.{&1310}\par There was \i nothing\i0  there.{&1310}\par I sat there, eyes darting about wildly while the door went to pieces behind me. There was nothing there. But something had pulled me away.{&1310}\par God, I was fucking crazy now too.{&1310}\par "Run!"{&1310}\par A voice hissed in my ear, and I could almost recognize it. I didn't listen, though. I just floated there, looking dumbly around.{&1310}\par That something grabbed me again. {&1310}\par It forced my hand over to the wall and made me push forward, back away from the door with those things. All at once I realized they were still thrashing behind me and panicked. I didn't need anything or anyone to pull me along then. I spun my\i self\i0  back around to swam away.{&1310}\par Doorframes. Floor grates. Emergency light fixtures. It didn't matter. I clawed, scratched, and snatched at anything with some purchase. Anything that got me further away back down the hall from that blood-mad howling. Too slow, I realized. I was just \i too \i0 slow. Why the hell hadn't I started running earlier?! It chased me all the way down the corridor into the next. And that was where I finally heard it. {&1310}\par The worst sound I had ever heard in my life. {&1310}\par The sound of that door finally ripping into pieces and those things in the corridor with me{&1310}\par Faceless screaming tore at the walls all up the red and black passage at me. Clicking on metal as they suddenly rushed headlong after, filling up the dark behind. I didn't look back. {&1310}\par "There!" that voice hissed again in my ear, and my head whipped to the right where I realized that some kind of open space was gaping in the dead air beside me. A low surface that I swung myself over and through without another thought. Then my hands found a vacancy and I slid underneath.{&1310}\par There were a few seconds then where I couldn't hear anything but the blood rushing through my head. So loud it drowned everything else out. Those things tore down the hallway in slow motion, and my world narrowed down to the rabid thumping in my chest. {&1310}\par I closed my eyes to shut it out.{&1310}\par And saw that dead forest from my dreams instead.{&1310}\par Those men were torn apart, shredded by shadow. Firebolts firing wildly and running desperate in the fog. For a moment it was those dead marines on board the station instead, as they fled screaming through the halls being butchered into pieces all along the decks. I saw it like it all happened in an instant right in front of me then. It didn't feel like a dream. Now it felt real.{&1310}\par My eyes opened again.{&1310}\par That fleshy screaming was fading away down the corridor. It had passed right by me and I could hear it lashing out at the bulkheads back the way I had come, echoing like a waking nightmare. I could almost breathe again, and the shivering wasn't so violent anymore. I eased clammy palms against the underside of the desk where I floated and swallowed hard. My whole body shuddered.{&1310}\par Something slammed into the surface above me.{&1310}\par I jerked, sucking in air. Then froze up, wide-eyed and staring at that metal like I could see through to the other side. Hands still flat against the underbelly, I felt it strain and shake with that thing on top it. For one horrifying moment ... I waited for it to come down for me there.{&1310}\par But it didn't. I managed to slowly drag my head away toward where the low, red lights from the corridor painted shadows on the far wall. One of them was huge, sitting right on top of that open space, and moving.{&1310}\par I waited, and listened. There was nothing else to do, struck frozen stiff beneath that thing. Clicking. This one didn't scream at me. Instead there was the wet sound of somethng ripping and scratching just on the other side of that metal between us. Inches away from my face.{&1310}\par It took me some time. But, eventually, I noticed the man-like shape underneath that bulk of shadow twitching against the wall. At least, I noticed the head shape sticking out to one side of it. And I watched the shades play against the wall as it dug into that corpse and chewed it to fleshy pieces.{&1310}\par A hand flopped over, hanging just over the edge of the desk and trickling blood down its fingers. Two of them were missing. A woman's hand, with a small metal band on one finger. I fixed on that for a long time while the thing ripped into skin and bone and organ. I fixed on that for a long time after the thing was finished and clicked away after the others.{&1310}\par }{&1310}

And my legs gave out.{&1310}\par Even before the rush and gargling scream. I collapsed down, that thing whipping one of its crooked, impossible limbs into the wall and slicing a hole right through it. I heard the metal rend, and my heart tried to burst -- but I flipped over onto my stomach first.{&1310}\par The pulse rifle slipped out of my hands and flew away loudly into the dark. I flung a mewling sound of self-pity and despair flung from my mouth along after it.{&1310}\par Another wet howl echoed in the corridor. I threw myself up to my feet, flying, stumbling around that thing and the bodies ahead. Instinct, and reflex. My own body sliced up into pieces flashed in my mind so suddenly I forgot I was already moving. {&1310}\par Something else snapped in just over my back. And again into the ground where my feet had been.{&1310}\par I hit another corner in the bulkheads -- a side hallway I could barely make out except for the shift in the dim, red panels on the floor and ceiling. I lashed out and caught it with both hands, slipping on dead people's blood on the deck. That took me clean off my feet again, but not on down the hall. I yanked myself over into the other hallway. That thing slashed in right behind.{&1310}\par It screamed at me. That fleshy, gaping-head scream filled with something worse than teeth. I tripped up a few desperate steps, blood slick on my shoes. Those emergency lights didn't do anything for the hallway but outline the walls, and they were out in some places. Covered up too, maybe. By bodies, blood, or something else -- I couldn't tell for sure. There was only red-tinged black ahead and that thing behind.{&1310}\par I charged the other end. Hard. But I didn't get far. There \i were\i0  more bodies on the floor. And I had the fleeting thought, as I slid wildly ahead into another wall, that there could have been even more of those things up ahead of me.{&1310}\par When I came back up, that thing was screaming right in my face.{&1310}\par It slashed something at me. My arm sliced open through the sleeve and whatever it was punched a hole in the deck. I remembered the dead marine all jacked up on the floor with his guts falling out as I spun around on my back in the blood on the ground, and both feet went flying. One managed to hit the thing somewhere.{&1310}\par It hit me again. Something blunt this time because it sent me sliding away down the hall. I slapped the deck and leapt back up to my feet, stumbled a few steps, and slipped into a door. It was shut tight.{&1310}\par I froze for one, terrible moment. That warbling started up again behind me, charging. Maybe it had never stopped. Everything went to cold, shivering ice again, and I tried to scream. But I just didn't have it in me.{&1310}\par Then I saw it. The door was open. {&1310}\par Just a little.{&1310}\par I didn't care. I flung myself at the hole without a second thought except for the murderous howl flying at me fast from behind. And got stuck partway through.{&1310}\par Maybe I looked back. The thing was just a big, black splotch against the blotted, dull lights. It was a horrible mistake. Pretty soon, it doubled up on itself and filled out the whole corridor with that black that was somehow void.{&1310}\par I sucked in, squeezed, and screamed. Hands scrabbling on both sides, I smeared blood all over the doors. Panic reached a fever pitch as my fingers slid all over. I didn't look back again. Couldn't. Even as it gargled another vicious shriek at me, I clawed my way through the door. It swiped that razor-sharp something for my head. {&1310}\par And then I was through.{&1310}\par I got halfway down the next corridor before I realized it, though.{&1310}\par Everything swirled around me in a blinding rush of black and red. I never stopped - barely slowed. But that thing was still caught in the door. I didn't look back, but I could hear it slashing at metal and screaming at me, trying to get through.{&1310}\par  I glanced down at my arm as I stumbled on -- at the blood dribbling down the length of it. It shook so hard it was hard to see in the dim light. And I had no idea how bad it was. But I couldn't care just then anyways. I just kept on running in the dark.{&1310}\par And that was when the gravity decided to go out, sending me tumbling wildly into the air.{&1310}\par I heard the subsystem die as my feet took off from the ground and my whole body kept careening forward. It died loudly with the emergency backups and I flailed desperately to catch myself on something -- \i anything\i0 ! It just sent me spinning. Something jumped up from the deck ahead of me and I screamed right before I slammed right into it.{&1310}\par Limbs tangled in mine and I punched, kicked, and shoved with every part of my body until it was away from me. We both hit the bulkhead, and I saw it was another headless corpse that I flung desperately away. The force of the kick sent me flying hard backward, though. I smacked the bulkhead with my head and saw stars. It was the brightest the world had been in what felt like forever.{&1310}\par The rest of it came back. {&1310}\par Slowly.{&1310}\par I had to get off this deck, was the languid thought in my head as I drift, slowing down, in the black. That thing was back there and it was going to kill me if I didn't get out of the tower and back to the habitats. But I had no idea where I even was.{&1310}\par There were more of those things too. I could hear them. Those creepy, piercing shrieks out of the dark that echoed around the corridor. Was anyone even still alive? What if the rest of the tower was just as bad as this one? What if everyone on Riftwatch was already dead? Huh? What \i then\i0 ?!{&1310}\par If that dark didn't get me killed, my eyes would. I couldn't keep tears from blinding them as I floated, feeling a hand to my throbbing head.{&1310}\par Eventually, my shoulder hit the deck -- what I \i thought\i0  was the deck -- and I had the presence of mind back to grab on to it. Any indent or rivulet in the metal. I scraped and scratched with my fingertips until I stopped myself from floating away again. Then I let go and swiped at my eyes.{&1310}\par \i Come on\i0 . MOVE.{&1310}\par It wasn't like that thing had gone quiet. I could hear metal rending way back behind me and echoing ahead. I had to keep moving. I had to hide and find a way off this deck.{&1310}\par I started to swim forward, lashing out with my blood-stained hands for anything along the way and pulling myself through the black and low, red light. My chest shook -- with sobs, I realized. And I couldn't make it stop. Fuck it, I \i tried\i0  ... {&1310}\par I hit another door. Spun myself around. And grabbed at the crack between them. I started prying them open, still wracked with shaking sobs that wouldn't go away. Just enough to peek into the next passageway.{&1310}\par Something leapt at my face as soon as I did.{&1310}\par That skin-ripping scream. I choked on my tongue, or else I would have screamed too. It slashed at me through the crack. Something caught in my side, and even more blood was spilling into the air.{&1310}\par I flung back. It howled, rearing and clawing at the door like some kind of rabid animal. And it wasn't alone. There was a whole other cabin out there. Not another corridor. What must have been a dozen of those things were suddenly flying and ripping at the metal between them and me.{&1310}\par The door bent, huge dents popping back in places. That warbling scream turned into a crescendo, making my ears bleed. I screamed too this time.{&1310}\par I guess I was dead. I saw Tess and dad in my head, bleeding out on the floor and torn apart. Bertram too. I saw all those bodies, in pieces all over everything. And I saw myself. The station ... it was just one big, bloody tomb for all of us.{&1310}\par My body floated over, bawling in the dark while those things tore open the door from the other side. If only Morisant and everyone else back at the academy could see me now. They'd know they'd been right about me. I was weak ... and useless, and ... I was about to get my guts ripped out of me in the worst way possible. I bet no one would even remember me once I was gone.{&1310}\par I might have tried to run, but I would've gotten nowhere hanging there in midair. One behind, a dozen in front of me- {&1310}\par My hand found the gun in my jacket pocket. {&1310}\par It was still there. I'd lost the rifle like a clumsy, fucking idiot but ... I still had the pistol. And I stabbed it out at those things without another thought.{&1310}\par I yanked on the trigger, and ...{&1310}\par Nothing.{&1310}\par Again.{&1310}\par Nothing.{&1310}\par That empty clicking sounded like deafening despair to my ears. I stared at the pistol while razored limbs whipped out in a frenzied mass of tentacles at the door. Howling and snarling and teeth like claws snapping bone. Metal groaned, and howled too. It started to finally come apart altogether.{&1310}\par I think I screamed again, shrieking fury and helplessness at that whole bloody mess. But no sound came out this time. Or they just drowned me out. I might have just thrown the pistol at them too. Holes appeared all over the door. It was already bent out of shape, folding in at me. It started to give way.{&1310}\par There were so many of them. I thought that with hopeless despair, and gave up. I just lay there, floating in air in the dark and tried not to think about how it would feel to get torn apart. And failed.{&1310}\par Then something grabbed my hand.{&1310}\par It dragged me to the floor. I screamed, and it spun me back around. {&1310}\par Nothing.{&1310}\par There was \i nothing\i0  there.{&1310}\par I sat there, eyes darting about wildly while the door went to pieces behind me. There was nothing there. But something had pulled me away.{&1310}\par God, I was fucking crazy now too.{&1310}\par "Run!"{&1310}\par A voice hissed in my ear, and I could almost recognize it. I didn't listen, though. I just floated there, looking dumbly around.{&1310}\par That something grabbed me again. {&1310}\par It forced my hand over to the wall and made me push forward, back away from the door with those things. All at once I realized they were still thrashing behind me and panicked. I didn't need anything or anyone to pull me along then. I spun my\i self\i0  back around to swam away.{&1310}\par Doorframes. Floor grates. Emergency light fixtures. It didn't matter. I clawed, scratched, and snatched at anything with some purchase. Anything that got me further away back down the hall from that blood-mad howling. Too slow, I realized. I was just \i too \i0 slow. Why the hell hadn't I started running earlier?! It chased me all the way down the corridor into the next. And that was where I finally heard it. {&1310}\par The worst sound I had ever heard in my life. {&1310}\par The sound of that door finally ripping into pieces and those things in the corridor with me{&1310}\par Faceless screaming tore at the walls all up the red and black passage at me. Clicking on metal as they suddenly rushed headlong after, filling up the dark behind. I didn't look back. {&1310}\par "There!" that voice hissed again in my ear, and my head whipped to the right where I realized that some kind of open space was gaping in the dead air beside me. A low surface that I swung myself over and through without another thought. Then my hands found a vacancy and I slid underneath.{&1310}\par There were a few seconds then where I couldn't hear anything but the blood rushing through my head. So loud it drowned everything else out. Those things tore down the hallway in slow motion, and my world narrowed down to the rabid thumping in my chest. {&1310}\par I closed my eyes to shut it out.{&1310}\par And saw that dead forest from my dreams instead.{&1310}\par Those men were torn apart, shredded by shadow. Firebolts firing wildly and running desperate in the fog. For a moment it was those dead marines on board the station instead, as they fled screaming through the halls being butchered into pieces all along the decks. I saw it like it all happened in an instant right in front of me then. It didn't feel like a dream. Now it felt real.{&1310}\par My eyes opened again.{&1310}\par That fleshy screaming was fading away down the corridor. It had passed right by me and I could hear it lashing out at the bulkheads back the way I had come, echoing like a waking nightmare. I could almost breathe again, and the shivering wasn't so violent anymore. I eased clammy palms against the underside of the desk where I floated and swallowed hard. My whole body shuddered.{&1310}\par Something slammed into the surface above me.{&1310}\par I jerked, sucking in air. Then froze up, wide-eyed and staring at that metal like I could see through to the other side. Hands still flat against the underbelly, I felt it strain and shake with that thing on top it. For one horrifying moment ... I waited for it to come down for me there.{&1310}\par But it didn't. I managed to slowly drag my head away toward where the low, red lights from the corridor painted shadows on the far wall. One of them was huge, sitting right on top of that open space, and moving.{&1310}\par I waited, and listened. There was nothing else to do, struck frozen stiff beneath that thing. Clicking. This one didn't scream at me. Instead there was the wet sound of somethng ripping and scratching just on the other side of that metal between us. Inches away from my face.{&1310}\par It took me some time. But, eventually, I noticed the man-like shape underneath that bulk of shadow twitching against the wall. At least, I noticed the head shape sticking out to one side of it. And I watched the shades play against the wall as it dug into that corpse and chewed it to fleshy pieces.{&1310}\par A hand flopped over, hanging just over the edge of the desk and trickling blood down its fingers. Two of them were missing. A woman's hand, with a small metal band on one finger. I fixed on that for a long time while the thing ripped into skin and bone and organ. I fixed on that for a long time after the thing was finished and clicked away after the others.{&1310}\par }{&1310}
