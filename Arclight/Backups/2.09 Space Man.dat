I mean, a \i splitting\i0  headache. Oh, and I couldn't move.{&1310}\par That took me back for a second. I reached up with a hand to touch my throbbing head, and it wouldn't budge more than a couple inches. I mumbled out a few unintelligible words at that, unsure and still groggy. But I got my eyes open soon enough, and grimaced down at where my arms were bound. I was strapped to one of the bunks inside the shuttle.{&1310}\par I didn't start screaming for help or anything, but I did start thrashing wildly about. It got the attention of someone else inside the shuttle. And, for the first time, I noticed that man crouched there at the rear hatch. At the sound of me trying to wrest myself free, he twisted back around with a gun pointed at my head. {&1310}\par My gun.{&1310}\par I mean - Ev's gun.{&1310}\par Either way, he stuck it in my face and I froze. I didn't quite like the thought of what one of those bolts of fire might do to my head. Not that I could keep it out.{&1310}\par It didn't seem to bother him much at all.{&1310}\par He stared at me. For the few moments I could manage to keep my eyes up and beyond the business end of that pistol, I stared at him too. Not a good look, since he had some kind of raggedy, old scarf wrapped around his head under the hood he had pulled down. But I could see his eyes as they pushed into me along with that gun. Dark. Brown. And cold. Dead, and cold.{&1310}\par It was like looking at a corpse.{&1310}\par "What do-"{&1310}\par "Don't talk," he finally opened his mouth under that wrap about the same time I decided too. Coincidence, I'm sure. But he ground the edge of the barrel into my temple to drive the point home. I guess my breaking out in a cold sweat and shaking didn't do much to dissuade him either.{&1310}\par I waited.{&1310}\par And waited.{&1310}\par And waited.{&1310}\par And-{&1310}\par He twisted back around suddenly, looking toward the rear hatch. It gave me a chance to wonder why we were in the shuttle and what the hell he was waiting for. Those brown eyes were darting about like they'd heard something outside, and he reach a hand up to quickly unravel the scarf enough to let an ear free. And that was when I got a half-decent look at the tattoos on that one side of his face.{&1310}\par "You're Eluvian!" I gasped out.{&1310}\par The pistol abruptly cracked me on the side of the head. My vision went sideways. Black spots flickered across my eyes, and I had a hard time swallowing. For a while, all I could see was Evelyn lying there on the opposite bunk, unconscious still and breathing shallow breaths.{&1310}\par There was a buzzing in my ears. Like a weight pressing down. I waited for it to pass with eyes open but not really seeing anything. When the rest of the world finally did come back, though, that man was gone.{&1310}\par I blinked around for a few minutes, a little drunk on the pain inside my head. I laughed by myself and winced. And any fantasies about pulling a daring escape were crushed when our rescuer slipped back into cabin again, almost too quiet to even notice.{&1310}\par "Are you alone?" he asked then, keeping that rifle of his trained on the partially opened hatch but still managing to stick the pistol to my head once more. His eyes darted between the opening and me.{&1310}\par I didn't say anything this time. Those rifle- and pistol-whippings were too fresh in mind. I just glared back at him over Ev's gun, and kept my mouth shut until he crouched down right next to my ear.{&1310}\par "Are you alone?" he repeated in a low growl. "Who's with you?"{&1310}\par Maybe he thought I was dumb. That gaze beat at mine like a hammer again. I waited until he got angry and opened his mouth. Then I slammed my forehead right into his.{&1310}\par Looking back, it wasn't really the best idea. Seemed okay at the time, though.{&1310}\par He nearly flipped over onto the ground. In surprise more than anything else. No, it was my world that suddenly burst into blinding pain and agony.{&1310}\par "DAMNIT!"{&1310}\par I would have grabbed at my head again. Not that it would have done any good. Instead, I was left to grind it helplessly into the hard bunk underneath, desperate just to block out the throbbing in my skull. For all my trouble I only got a third lump there.{&1310}\par And maybe a little something else.{&1310}\par "Tell me," the man grunted down at me, returning the gun to my temple and pressing hard. He regained his composure a lot quicker, and was standing over me now. {&1310}\par "Now."{&1310}\par I winced without opening my eyes or looking at him. I could feel his own eyes on me just the same. Eventually, I just shook my head.{&1310}\par "Nobody's with us!"{&1310}\par If I thought that might get him to let up on the gun pointed at my brain, though, I was wrong. He pushed it even harder, enough to make me cry out a little in surprise.{&1310}\par "Are you sure?"{&1310}\par "What do you mean am I sure?" I snapped right back. "\i Yes\i0 , I'm sure, asshole!"{&1310}\par He did ease back a bit after another second, but not by much. I just grimaced at him with one eye half-open.{&1310}\par "I thought Eluvians weren't supposed to be into the whole killing thing," I mumbled miserably. He stared at me for a second. Then laughed. It wasn't a pleasant sound. More like grinding rubble.{&1310}\par "What rock did you just crawl off of?" he asked, and it was just as unpleasant. And rhetorical, because he didn't bother to wait for an answer to that one. {&1310}\par "What happened to your friend here?"{&1310}\par He moved towards Ev still lying comatose on the other bunk. And I just about lost it.{&1310}\par "Get away from her!" {&1310}\par I lashed out as violently as I could in an instant, but the ripped sheets binding me to the bed held me back. He ignored me, picking over her bandages. I couldn't see just what he was doing with his back to me, but I saw Ev squirm a bit in her sleep, groaning aloud. Her face was slick with sweat. {&1310}\par  "Don't you fucking touch her!" I growled at him. And I threw in a few dozen more choice words about how stupid and ugly and dirty he was. He got tired of it eventually.{&1310}\par "Shut up," he snapped, but I didn't stop. Not until the gun came back, pointed at my head like always. He let Ev be, though. "I didn't touch her," he tried to lie to me. \tab {&1310}\par I glared at him over the pistol. That kept him on me, and away from Ev.{&1310}\par "I'll ask again," he said, voice low but unconcerned. I wasn't enough of a threat to him to forget her completely. "What happened to your friend?"{&1310}\par "What do \i you\i0  care?" I spat at him. But he didn't bother to let me in on a reason - just stared at me with that bludgeoning gaze. Eventually, I mumbled something angry out about her ship being attacked. It really didn't matter as long as he left her alone. And I made sure he thought she was really sick too.{&1310}\par "Pirates?" he demanded in surprise, ignoring that other bit. Or - as surprised as that face could look. He quirked an eyebrow at me.{&1310}\par "I don't know," I muttered back, not really caring about that part myself. "Maybe."{&1310}\par "Is that why you set the distress beacon?" he continued, though. "Are you two the only survivors?"{&1310}\par "How the hell should I know? The beacon was so someone would come and actually \i help\i0  us!"{&1310}\par He studied me and my angry look a moment longer before turning away. It gave me a chance to look over his clothes for the first time - a long coat draped down over tough pants and thick boots. Lots of heavy-duty pockets and things belted to legs, arms, waist - you name it. Another gun, and a few more knives spread around. He looked like he was ready to go hunting, or shooting, or something. Not exactly the rescue I had been thinking of. And a \i lot \i0 of things he could use against us.{&1310}\par It was quiet for a bit. I guess he was thinking, because he forgot me for that little while. Long enough for me to work some magic while I waited. I nearly jumped out of my skin when he opened his mouth again. Luckily, I didn't. Not too soon.{&1310}\par "Where did the pirates attack you?" he started up the interrogation right where he left off, only giving me a sideways glance across his shoulder. Not enough to do him any good in catching me as I started to slip out of those bonds. "Over the planet?"{&1310}\par I had other ideas than answer his stupid questions, though. And they involved rushing that Eluvian man from behind - knocking him right into the rear hatch.{&1310}\par And that's exactly what I did.{&1310}\par He was bigger, and heavier than me. I screamed out as I charged him and I must have done something way to right, because he went flying upwards and his head hit the overhead panel hard enough to knock him right out. That brought his full weight down on me, though. And we collapsed in a heap just under the rear hatch.{&1310}\par No gunfire. No yelling or punching or kicking. Just the sudden quiet of the shuttle, and that limp body crushing down on me.{&1310}\par Good enough.\cf2 {&1310}\par }{&1310}

I mean, a \i splitting\i0  headache. Oh, and I couldn't move.{&1310}\par That took me back for a second. I reached up with a hand to touch my throbbing head, and it wouldn't budge more than a couple inches. I mumbled out a few unintelligible words at that, unsure and still groggy. But I got my eyes open soon enough, and grimaced down at where my arms were bound. I was strapped to one of the bunks inside the shuttle.{&1310}\par I didn't start screaming for help or anything, but I did start thrashing wildly about. It got the attention of someone else inside the shuttle. And, for the first time, I noticed that man crouched there at the rear hatch. At the sound of me trying to wrest myself free, he twisted back around with a gun pointed at my head. {&1310}\par My gun.{&1310}\par I mean - Ev's gun.{&1310}\par Either way, he stuck it in my face and I froze. I didn't quite like the thought of what one of those bolts of fire might do to my head. Not that I could keep it out.{&1310}\par It didn't seem to bother him much at all.{&1310}\par He stared at me. For the few moments I could manage to keep my eyes up and beyond the business end of that pistol, I stared at him too. Not a good look, since he had some kind of raggedy, old scarf wrapped around his head under the hood he had pulled down. But I could see his eyes as they pushed into me along with that gun. Dark. Brown. And cold. Dead, and cold.{&1310}\par It was like looking at a corpse.{&1310}\par "What do-"{&1310}\par "Don't talk," he finally opened his mouth under that wrap about the same time I decided too. Coincidence, I'm sure. But he ground the edge of the barrel into my temple to drive the point home. I guess my breaking out in a cold sweat and shaking didn't do much to dissuade him either.{&1310}\par I waited.{&1310}\par And waited.{&1310}\par And waited.{&1310}\par And-{&1310}\par He twisted back around suddenly, looking toward the rear hatch. It gave me a chance to wonder why we were in the shuttle and what the hell he was waiting for. Those brown eyes were darting about like they'd heard something outside, and he reach a hand up to quickly unravel the scarf enough to let an ear free. And that was when I got a half-decent look at the tattoos on that one side of his face.{&1310}\par "You're Eluvian!" I gasped out.{&1310}\par The pistol abruptly cracked me on the side of the head. My vision went sideways. Black spots flickered across my eyes, and I had a hard time swallowing. For a while, all I could see was Evelyn lying there on the opposite bunk, unconscious still and breathing shallow breaths.{&1310}\par There was a buzzing in my ears. Like a weight pressing down. I waited for it to pass with eyes open but not really seeing anything. When the rest of the world finally did come back, though, that man was gone.{&1310}\par I blinked around for a few minutes, a little drunk on the pain inside my head. I laughed by myself and winced. And any fantasies about pulling a daring escape were crushed when our rescuer slipped back into cabin again, almost too quiet to even notice.{&1310}\par "Are you alone?" he asked then, keeping that rifle of his trained on the partially opened hatch but still managing to stick the pistol to my head once more. His eyes darted between the opening and me.{&1310}\par I didn't say anything this time. Those rifle- and pistol-whippings were too fresh in mind. I just glared back at him over Ev's gun, and kept my mouth shut until he crouched down right next to my ear.{&1310}\par "Are you alone?" he repeated in a low growl. "Who's with you?"{&1310}\par Maybe he thought I was dumb. That gaze beat at mine like a hammer again. I waited until he got angry and opened his mouth. Then I slammed my forehead right into his.{&1310}\par Looking back, it wasn't really the best idea. Seemed okay at the time, though.{&1310}\par He nearly flipped over onto the ground. In surprise more than anything else. No, it was my world that suddenly burst into blinding pain and agony.{&1310}\par "DAMNIT!"{&1310}\par I would have grabbed at my head again. Not that it would have done any good. Instead, I was left to grind it helplessly into the hard bunk underneath, desperate just to block out the throbbing in my skull. For all my trouble I only got a third lump there.{&1310}\par And maybe a little something else.{&1310}\par "Tell me," the man grunted down at me, returning the gun to my temple and pressing hard. He regained his composure a lot quicker, and was standing over me now. {&1310}\par "Now."{&1310}\par I winced without opening my eyes or looking at him. I could feel his own eyes on me just the same. Eventually, I just shook my head.{&1310}\par "Nobody's with us!"{&1310}\par If I thought that might get him to let up on the gun pointed at my brain, though, I was wrong. He pushed it even harder, enough to make me cry out a little in surprise.{&1310}\par "Are you sure?"{&1310}\par "What do you mean am I sure?" I snapped right back. "\i Yes\i0 , I'm sure, asshole!"{&1310}\par He did ease back a bit after another second, but not by much. I just grimaced at him with one eye half-open.{&1310}\par "I thought Eluvians weren't supposed to be into the whole killing thing," I mumbled miserably. He stared at me for a second. Then laughed. It wasn't a pleasant sound. More like grinding rubble.{&1310}\par "What rock did you just crawl off of?" he asked, and it was just as unpleasant. And rhetorical, because he didn't bother to wait for an answer to that one. {&1310}\par "What happened to your friend here?"{&1310}\par He moved towards Ev still lying comatose on the other bunk. And I just about lost it.{&1310}\par "Get away from her!" {&1310}\par I lashed out as violently as I could in an instant, but the ripped sheets binding me to the bed held me back. He ignored me, picking over her bandages. I couldn't see just what he was doing with his back to me, but I saw Ev squirm a bit in her sleep, groaning aloud. Her face was slick with sweat. {&1310}\par  "Don't you fucking touch her!" I growled at him. And I threw in a few dozen more choice words about how stupid and ugly and dirty he was. He got tired of it eventually.{&1310}\par "Shut up," he snapped, but I didn't stop. Not until the gun came back, pointed at my head like always. He let Ev be, though. "I didn't touch her," he tried to lie to me. \tab {&1310}\par I glared at him over the pistol. That kept him on me, and away from Ev.{&1310}\par "I'll ask again," he said, voice low but unconcerned. I wasn't enough of a threat to him to forget her completely. "What happened to your friend?"{&1310}\par "What do \i you\i0  care?" I spat at him. But he didn't bother to let me in on a reason - just stared at me with that bludgeoning gaze. Eventually, I mumbled something angry out about her ship being attacked. It really didn't matter as long as he left her alone. And I made sure he thought she was really sick too.{&1310}\par "Pirates?" he demanded in surprise, ignoring that other bit. Or - as surprised as that face could look. He quirked an eyebrow at me.{&1310}\par "I don't know," I muttered back, not really caring about that part myself. "Maybe."{&1310}\par "Is that why you set the distress beacon?" he continued, though. "Are you two the only survivors?"{&1310}\par "How the hell should I know? The beacon was so someone would come and actually \i help\i0  us!"{&1310}\par He studied me and my angry look a moment longer before turning away. It gave me a chance to look over his clothes for the first time - a long coat draped down over tough pants and thick boots. Lots of heavy-duty pockets and things belted to legs, arms, waist - you name it. Another gun, and a few more knives spread around. He looked like he was ready to go hunting, or shooting, or something. Not exactly the rescue I had been thinking of. And a \i lot \i0 of things he could use against us.{&1310}\par It was quiet for a bit. I guess he was thinking, because he forgot me for that little while. Long enough for me to work some magic while I waited. I nearly jumped out of my skin when he opened his mouth again. Luckily, I didn't. Not too soon.{&1310}\par "Where did the pirates attack you?" he started up the interrogation right where he left off, only giving me a sideways glance across his shoulder. Not enough to do him any good in catching me as I started to slip out of those bonds. "Over the planet?"{&1310}\par I had other ideas than answer his stupid questions, though. And they involved rushing that Eluvian man from behind - knocking him right into the rear hatch.{&1310}\par And that's exactly what I did.{&1310}\par He was bigger, and heavier than me. I screamed out as I charged him and I must have done something way to right, because he went flying upwards and his head hit the overhead panel hard enough to knock him right out. That brought his full weight down on me, though. And we collapsed in a heap just under the rear hatch.{&1310}\par No gunfire. No yelling or punching or kicking. Just the sudden quiet of the shuttle, and that limp body crushing down on me.{&1310}\par Good enough.\cf2 {&1310}\par }{&1310}
