F4. We were the fourth platoon in our company, and the first company in the battalion. Cadets, servicemen instructors, and naval officers. We weren't the navy, and we weren't the marines. We were something else. Because we were expected to fight like something else. But we still had to PT like everyone else. You couldn't have fat psychos fighting pirates and embarassing the Grand Admirals, right?{&1310}\par "Left. Left. Lefty-right-a-ley-ooo!"{&1310}\par Morisant had billeted Dubois with leading our unit through physical training today, which was good. I liked it when Dubois played platoon sergeant because he sang those lines out at the top of his lungs like his life depended on bringing some soul to the cadence. He did. He had a beautiful voice and somehow didn't let the artificial gravity beat it out of him into a breathy rasp like most of the rest of us. Me? I sucked at it, like a lot of other people. But hearing him give it his all like that sometimes made me forget about my chest feeling like it was about to explode any second. For a little while.{&1310}\par Another heavy-G run for Foxtrot 4. The track we used was built up inside one of the athletic areas aboard the \i Soyorov\i0 , this one fitted for adjustable gravity simulation levels. And that just meant they turned it up. One kilometer - two, three ... it stopped mattering so much when I felt like I was beating feet with a couple dozen kilos on my back. I started to wonder if I could have a heartattack before hitting twenty-five.{&1310}\par "Mission top secret, destination unknooooown!"{&1310}\par A dull, out-of-breath roar blasted from the other cadets around me. Dubois had moved into another cadence, full of motivation. I was pretty good at running on my own, but this was something different. And the rest of the weight, cardio, and combat training was pretty brutal -- mostly because you never felt right or ready for it when it came. At least I never did. I was always tired, always out of breath. Exhausted, even in bed. It made me do and say stupid things.{&1310}\par "Captain had a mission that he had to compleeeete -- Some sorry ass grunts were about to get beat!"{&1310}\par Thirteen days, ten hours, and forty-two minutes left until we got off for pre-finals leave. It'd be the first time anyone had gotten to see home again since we started six months ago. I couldn't think about that anymore than I could think about what we were doing right now. It would ruin me, and I would fall apart. I just stared at Kerensky's name in front of me, emblazoned on the back of his PT suit, as he puffed his elbows forward and back in time to the cadence.{&1310}\par I kept up. I barely more than mouthed the words when we echoed Dubois back, but I kept the pace. It was like the one thing they couldn't make me look terrible at yet. I couldn't lead a squad exercise and I had no killer instinct, but I could run forever as long as the instructors were watching.{&1310}\par "He thought just a second then called up the bay -- Said 'Psychos gonna fuck shit up to-day'!"{&1310}\par We finished. We hit the squad bay. We took showers. We changed.{&1310}\par Then it was time for fighting sticks.{&1310}\par "This late in the game and you're still making those dumb mistakes, Peterson? Why don't you do us all a favor and pull your head out of Jiguli's ass!"{&1310}\par "You serious with this shit, Maya?"{&1310}\par "Ohhh, you think that's how it's done, fucktard. Maybe Foley will beat some sense into your fucking head while you're CRYING ON THE FUCKING FLOOR!"{&1310}\par "You hold onto that stick like it's your god damned cock, Xander, and don't you let him disarm you again."{&1310}\par "Oh, not that little \i looove\i0  tap. That didn't hurt. Just you wait until it's one of those fucking pirates -- is fucking bashing in -- your fucking skull!"{&1310}\par The sergeant instructors walked up and down the aisles as we sparred. They were mostly marines who'd done two tours in the void already, and had that dead look in their flinty eyes to prove it. You could hear their yelling from one end of the room to another, unless they got really worked up in some poor cadet's face. Then the sound just bounced around inside its own echo until it barely made sense anymore. Not that it mattered. A seven-foot-tall red-faced instructor who looked like he'd been fed muscle-enhancement nanos everyday for the last four years and was constantly on the verge of another heart attack he'd just shrug off like all the others ... might have been scary for the first month or two after we'd gotten here. Now, they mostly just went ignored when they were screaming and playing that game. I knew when they had something worthwhile to say because they got real serious and quiet. Dangerously so. I listened -- really \i listened \i0 -- when they did that. That was when I \i learned\i0  something.{&1310}\par Lieutenant Morisant stalked up and down the aisles too. Unlike the sergeant instructors, who stomped along in form-fitting PT outfits, he looked smart in full field uniform with all his medals and rank on proud display. He was navy, and he had at least two tours behind him. But he also had something the grunts helping train his tired unit of cadets didn't have. {&1310}\par He was a Psycho.{&1310}\par None of us had ever seen him \i do\i0  anything, and I think that was the scariest part about him. That he might have all that power just teeming beneath the surface waiting to burst and lash out at something -- someone -- \i anything\i0 . That he kept it so under control that you'd never know he wasn't just another naval officer in smart dress. I had regular nightmares sometimes where he came down on me and started tearing me apart with unseen, psychokinetic hands while those cold, dead eyes just watched in disapproval. Judging me. \i Evaluating\i0 . While my insides spilled out onto the floor. It was pretty fucked up. And \i I\i0  had actually grown up with a dad who strangers would tell me all the time was famous for being one of the most powerful psychokinetics in the sector.{&1310}\par Morisant took his time, inspecting people here and there with his hands clasped behind his back -- looking bluff and unflappable and unimpressed. His poker face never broke. But he did say a word here or there about how well someone was doing when they were doing really well. It wasn't kind or enthusiastic or passionate in any way -- just a statement of fact. To those who weren't doing well, he didn't say a word. That pretty much included me by default.{&1310}\par If you couldn't tell that the semester was winding down by counting the days until graduation, you knew it by those two things alone. The instructors wild desperation to instill some ounce of terror into their cadets. The CO of our training unit quietly contemplating everyone with hard lines of pass or fail.  It had all the finality to it of something coming to an end. {&1310}\par But who would graduate and who would be booted out on their ass? That was always the question. Even from day one.{&1310}\par Kominshk was my partner for sparring. We went at it with the staff mostly, like we were supposed to. But you couldn't help mixing in some other hand-to-hand techniques here and there.  Yeguns was what the official name for them was, but no one used it -- not even the instructors really. It was a throwback from the old Imperial days and most people hated to hear that stuff now. But it was all just jingoism.{&1310}\par Like out on the running track, they'd used the environmental controls to liven up training. In here, they cranked up the temperature inside the combat practice room to near-boiling instead. Sweat coated the inside of my palms around my fighting stick and my hair felt sticky and gross no matter how tight I'd pulled it back. Strands of Komi's were bursting out in ragged clumps that slinked along her sweaty, brown face. Just looking at her made me feel overcooked and tired. But this was the one thing I could do better than her.{&1310}\par I squared off with Komi again and again. Sometimes she got me, but most of the time I sent her crashing down to the floor. It started to fade into redundancy and I became aware of the lieutenant walking along behind the cadets, appraising. I waited -- half-dreading, half-excited -- for him to reach us. When he did, he stopped for a minute. He actually stopped and watched.{&1310}\par I was distracted, but I still managed to block Komi's suddenly vigorous attack, turn it back, spin her around, and throw her into the ground. She tried even harder now that Morisant was watching. Her form and technique were good, but I was faster. I anticipated her almost every time, and beat her. I beat her -- while Morisant watched.{&1310}\par A part of me felt very satisfied with that.{&1310}\par Another part felt terrible that it had to be Komi getting beat.{&1310}\par "It's too bad, Weir," the lieutenant abruptly spoke and I just as abruptly lost my balance in surprise. Kominshk didn't hesitate in the attack she laid into me. I barely managed to parry her away.{&1310}\par "We might have found the one thing you're good at."{&1310}\par He moved on before I could even \i think\i0  to utter a "thank you, sir." He moved on, but those words stuck with me just the same. We'd been doing martial combat training sessions all semester long, but Morisant rarely took a closer look -- just standing at the head of the room to oversee the unit in general. It was a small part of what it meant to be a Psycho, really. Your mind was the real weapon. And it wasn't like I'd always been any good. But I'd worked at it, and it stuck unlike most of the other stuff that I just couldn't seem to do right when I had everyone looking at me and an instructor barking down my neck. He'd given me the first approval I'd ever gotten from him, or maybe anyone that mattered here. Morisant. My face burned with another kind of heat, and I lost my edge just thinking about how wonderful that felt.{&1310}\par And Komi knocked me flat on my ass in a heartbeat.\cf2\f1 {&1310}\par }{&1310}

You could hear their yelling from one end of the room to another, unless they got really worked up in some poor cadet's face. Then the sound just bounced around inside its own echo until it barely made sense anymore. Not that it mattered. A seven-foot-tall red-faced instructor who looked like he'd been fed muscle-enhancement nanos everyday for the last four years and was constantly on the verge of another heart attack he'd just shrug off like all the others might have been scary for the first month or two after we'd gotten here. Now, they mostly just went ignored when they were screaming and playing that game. You knew when they had something worthwhile to say because they got dangerously serious and quiet. You listened -- really \i listened \i0 -- when they did that. That was when you \i learned\i0  something.{&1310}\par Lieutenant Morisant stalked up and down the aisles too. Unlike the instructors, who stomped along in form-fitting PT outfits, he looked smart in full field uniform with all his medals and rank on proud display. He took his time, inspecting people here and there with his hands clasped behind his back -- looking bluff and unflappable and unimpressed. His poker face never broke. But he did say a word here or there about how well someone was doing when they were doing really well. It wasn't kind or enthusiastic or passionate in any way -- just a statement of fact. To those who weren't doing well, he didn't say a word.{&1310}\par If you couldn't tell that the semester was winding down by counting the days until graduation, you knew it by those two things alone. The instructors seemingly wild desperation to instill some last ounce of terror into their cadets. The CO of our training unit quietly contemplating everyone with hard lines of pass or fail -- who will graduate and who will be booted out on their ass to crawl back home where they came from. That atmosphere had all the finality in it to tell you that it was coming close to the end.{&1310}\par Kominshk was my partner for sparring. We went at it with fighting sticks, rotating through the forms they told us to as the instructor in charge of the field that day shouted out what we should be working on into the comms. There would have been more energy in the room if they hadn't upped the temperature to near-boiling. Sweat coated the inside of my palms around my fighting stick and my hair still felt sticky and gross no matter how tight I'd pulled it back. Strand's of Komi's were bursting out in ragged clumps that slinked along her sweaty, brown face. Just looking at her made me feel overcooked and tired. But this was the one thing I could do better than her.{&1310}\par I squared off with Komi again and again. Sometimes she got me, but most of the time I sent her crashing down to the floor. It started to fade into redundancy and I became aware of the lieutenant walking along behind the cadets, appraising. I waited -- half-dreading, half-excited -- for him to reach us. When he did, he stopped for a minute. He actually stopped and watched.{&1310}\par I was distracted, but I still managed to block Komi's suddenly vigorous attack, turn it back, spin her around, and throw her into the ground. She tried even harder now that Morisant was watching. Her form and technique were good, but I was faster. I anticipated her almost every time, and beat her. I beat her ... while Morisant watched.{&1310}\par A part of me felt very satisfied with that.{&1310}\par Another part felt terrible that it had to be Komi getting beat.{&1310}\par "It's too bad, Weir," the lieutenant abruptly spoke and I just as abruptly lost my balance in surprise. Kominshk didn't hesitate in the attack she laid into me. I barely managed to parry her away.{&1310}\par "We might have found the one thing that you're good at."{&1310}\par He moved on before I could even \i think\i0  to utter a "thank you, sir." He moved on, but those words stuck with me just the same. We'd been doing martial combat training sessions all semester long, but Morisant rarely took a closer look -- just standing at the head of the room to oversee the unit in general. And he'd given me the first approval I'd ever gotten from him, or maybe anyone that mattered here. My face burned with a different kind of heat, and I lost my edge just thinking about how wonderful that felt.{&1310}\par And Komi knocked me flat on my ass in a heartbeat.\cf2\f1 {&1310}\par }{&1310}

F4. We were the fourth platoon in our company, and the first company in the battalion. Cadets, servicemen instructors, and naval officers. We weren't the navy, and we weren't the marines. We were something else. Because we were expected to fight like something else. But we still had to PT like everyone else. You couldn't have fat psychos fighting pirates and embarassing the Grand Admirals, right?{&1310}\par "Left. Left. Lefty-right-a-ley-ooo!"{&1310}\par Morisant had billeted Dubois with leading our unit through physical training today, which was good. I liked it when Dubois played platoon sergeant because he sang those lines out at the top of his lungs like his life depended on bringing some soul to the cadence. He did. He had a beautiful voice and somehow didn't let the artificial gravity beat it out of him into a breathy rasp like most of the rest of us. Me? I sucked at it, like a lot of other people. But hearing him give it his all like that sometimes made me forget about my chest feeling like it was about to explode any second. For a little while.{&1310}\par Another heavy-G run for Foxtrot 4. The track we used was built up inside one of the athletic areas aboard the \i Soyorov\i0 , this one fitted for adjustable gravity simulation levels. And that just meant they turned it up. One kilometer - two, three ... it stopped mattering so much when I felt like I was beating feet with a couple dozen kilos on my back. I started to wonder if I could have a heartattack before hitting twenty-five.{&1310}\par "Mission top secret, destination unknooooown!"{&1310}\par A dull, out-of-breath roar blasted from the other cadets around me. Dubois had moved into another cadence, full of motivation. I was pretty good at running on my own, but this was something different. And the rest of the weight, cardio, and combat training was pretty brutal -- mostly because you never felt right or ready for it when it came. At least I never did. I was always tired, always out of breath. Exhausted, even in bed. It made me do and say stupid things.{&1310}\par "Captain had a mission that he had to compleeeete -- Some sorry ass grunts were about to get beat!"{&1310}\par Thirteen days, ten hours, and forty-two minutes left until we got off for pre-finals leave. It'd be the first time anyone had gotten to see home again since we started six months ago. I couldn't think about that anymore than I could think about what we were doing right now. It would ruin me, and I would fall apart. I just stared at Kerensky's name in front of me, emblazoned on the back of his PT suit, as he puffed his elbows forward and back in time to the cadence.{&1310}\par I kept up. I barely more than mouthed the words when we echoed Dubois back, but I kept the pace. It was like the one thing they couldn't make me look terrible at yet. I couldn't lead a squad exercise and I had no killer instinct, but I could run forever as long as the instructors were watching.{&1310}\par "He thought just a second then called up the bay -- Said 'Psychos gonna fuck shit up to-day'!"{&1310}\par We finished. We hit the squad bay. We took showers. We changed.{&1310}\par Then it was time for fighting sticks.{&1310}\par "This late in the game and you're still making those dumb mistakes, Peterson? Why don't you do us all a favor and pull your head out of Jiguli's ass!"{&1310}\par "You serious with this shit, Maya?"{&1310}\par "Ohhh, you think that's how it's done, fucktard.

That didn't hurt. Just you wait until it's one of those fucking pirates -- is fucking bashing in -- your fucking skull!"{&1310}\par The instructors walked up and down the aisles as we sparred. You could hear their yelling from one end of the room to another, unless they got really worked up in some poor cadet's face. Then the sound just bounced around inside its own echo until it barely made sense anymore. Not that it mattered. A seven-foot-tall red-faced instructor who looked like he'd been fed muscle-enhancement nanos everyday for the last four years and was constantly on the verge of another heart attack he'd just shrug off like all the others ... might have been scary for the first month or two after we'd gotten here. Now, they mostly just went ignored when they were screaming and playing that game. You knew when they had something worthwhile to say because they got real serious and quiet. Dangerously so. You listened -- really \i listened \i0 -- when they did that. That was when you \i learned\i0  something.{&1310}\par Lieutenant Morisant stalked up and down the aisles too. Unlike the instructors, who stomped along in form-fitting PT outfits, he looked smart in full field uniform with all his medals and rank on proud display. He took his time, inspecting people here and there with his hands clasped behind his back -- looking bluff and unflappable and unimpressed. His poker face never broke. But he did say a word here or there about how well someone was doing when they were doing really well. It wasn't kind or enthusiastic or passionate in any way -- just a statement of fact. To those who weren't doing well, he didn't say a word.{&1310}\par If you couldn't tell that the semester was winding down by counting the days until graduation, you knew it by those two things alone. The instructors wild desperation to instill some ounce of terror into their cadets. The CO of our training unit quietly contemplating everyone with hard lines of pass or fail.  It had all the finality to it of something coming to an end. {&1310}\par But who would graduate and who would be booted out on their ass? That was always the question. Even from day one.{&1310}\par Kominshk was my partner for sparring. We went at it with the staff mostly, like we were supposed to. But you couldn't help mixing in some other hand-to-hand techniques here and there.  Yeguns was what the official name for them was, but no one used it -- not even the instructors really. It was a throwback from the old Imperial days and most people hated to hear that stuff now. But it was all just jingoism.{&1310}\par Like out on the running track, they'd used the environmental controls to crank up the temperature inside the combat practice room to near-boiling.

It was a small part of what it meant to be a Psycho, really. Your mind was the real weapon. And it wasn't like I'd always been any good. But I'd worked at it, and it stuck unlike most of the other stuff that I just couldn't seem to do right when I had everyone looking at me and an instructor barking down my neck. He'd given me the first approval I'd ever gotten from him, or maybe anyone that mattered here. Morisant. My face burned with another kind of heat, and I lost my edge just thinking about how wonderful that felt.{&1310}\par And Komi knocked me flat on my ass in a heartbeat.\cf2\f1 {&1310}\par }{&1310}
Version Backup 2015-04-16¶{\rtf1\ansi\ansicpg1252\deff0{\fonttbl{\f0\fnil\fcharset0 Garamond;}{\f1\fnil\fcharset0 Arial;}}{&1310}{\colortbl ;\red128\green128\blue128;\red255\green255\blue255;}{&1310}\viewkind4\uc1\pard\fi720\sl480\slmult1\cf1\lang1033\f0\fs22 {&1310}\par {&1310}\par There were forty cadets in our training platoon, Foxtrot 4. F4. We were the fourth platoon in our company, and the first company in the battalion. Cadets, servicemen instructors, and naval officers. We weren't the navy, and we weren't the marines. We were something else. Because we were expected to fight like something else. But we still had to PT like everyone else. You couldn't have fat psychos fighting pirates and embarassing the Grand Admirals, right?{&1310}\par "Left. Left. Lefty-right-a-ley-ooo!"{&1310}\par Morisant had billeted Dubois with leading our unit through physical training today, which was good. I liked it when Dubois played platoon sergeant because he sang those lines out at the top of his lungs like his life depended on bringing some soul to the cadence. He did. He had a beautiful voice and somehow didn't let the artificial gravity beat it out of him into a breathy rasp like most of the rest of us. Me? I sucked at it, like a lot of other people. But hearing him give it his all like that sometimes made me forget about my chest feeling like it was about to explode any second. For a little while.{&1310}\par Another heavy-G run for Foxtrot 4. The track we used was built up inside one of the athletic areas aboard the \i Soyorov\i0 , this one fitted for adjustable gravity simulation levels. And that just meant they turned it up. One kilometer - two, three ... it stopped mattering so much when I felt like I was beating feet with a couple dozen kilos on my back. I started to wonder if I could have a heartattack before hitting twenty-five.{&1310}\par "Mission top secret, destination unknooooown!"{&1310}\par A dull, out-of-breath roar blasted from the other cadets around me. Dubois had moved into another cadence, full of motivation. I was pretty good at running on my own, but this was something different. And the rest of the weight, cardio, and combat training was pretty brutal -- mostly because you never felt right or ready for it when it came. At least I never did. I was always tired, always out of breath. Exhausted, even in bed. It made me do and say stupid things.{&1310}\par "Captain had a mission that he had to compleeeete -- Some sorry ass grunts were about to get beat!"{&1310}\par Thirteen days, ten hours, and forty-two minutes left until we got off for pre-finals leave. It'd be the first time anyone had gotten to see home again since we started six months ago. I couldn't think about that anymore than I could think about what we were doing right now. It would ruin me, and I would fall apart. I just stared at Kerensky's name in front of me, emblazoned on the back of his PT suit, as he puffed his elbows forward and back in time to the cadence.{&1310}\par I kept up. I barely more than mouthed the words when we echoed Dubois back, but I kept the pace. It was like the one thing they couldn't make me look terrible at yet. I couldn't lead a squad exercise and I had no killer instinct, but I could run forever as long as the instructors were watching.{&1310}\par "He thought just a second then called up the bay -- Said 'Psychos gonna fuck shit up to-day'!"{&1310}\par We finished. We hit the squad bay. We took showers. We changed.{&1310}\par Then it was time for fighting sticks.{&1310}\par "This late in the game and you're still making those dumb mistakes, Peterson? Why don't you do us all a favor and pull your head out of Jiguli's ass!"{&1310}\par "You serious with this shit, Maya?"{&1310}\par "Ohhh, you think that's how it's done, fucktard. Maybe Foley will beat some sense into your fucking head while you're CRYING ON THE FUCKING FLOOR!"{&1310}\par "You hold onto that stick like it's your god damned cock, Xander, and don't you let him disarm you again."{&1310}\par "Oh, not that little \i looove\i0  tap. That didn't hurt. Just you wait until it's one of those fucking pirates -- is fucking bashing in -- your fucking skull!"{&1310}\par The sergeant instructors walked up and down the aisles as we sparred. They were mostly marines who'd done two tours in the void already, and had that dead look in their flinty eyes to prove it. You could hear their yelling from one end of the room to another, unless they got really worked up in some poor cadet's face. Then the sound just bounced around inside its own echo until it barely made sense anymore. Not that it mattered. A seven-foot-tall red-faced instructor who looked like he'd been fed muscle-enhancement nanos everyday for the last four years and was constantly on the verge of another heart attack he'd just shrug off like all the others ... might have been scary for the first month or two after we'd gotten here. Now, they mostly just went ignored when they were screaming and playing that game. I knew when they had something worthwhile to say because they got real serious and quiet. Dangerously so. I listened -- really \i listened \i0 -- when they did that. That was when I \i learned\i0  something.{&1310}\par Lieutenant Morisant stalked up and down the aisles too. Unlike the sergeant instructors, who stomped along in form-fitting PT outfits, he looked smart in full field uniform with all his medals and rank on proud display. He was navy, and he had at least two tours behind him. But he also had something the grunts helping train his tired unit of cadets didn't have. {&1310}\par He was a Psycho.{&1310}\par None of us had ever seen him \i do\i0  anything, and I think that was the scariest part about him. That he might have all that power just teeming beneath the surface waiting to burst and lash out at something -- someone -- \i anything\i0 . That he kept it so under control that you'd never know he wasn't just another naval officer in smart dress. I had regular nightmares sometimes where he came down on me and started tearing me apart with unseen, psychokinetic hands while those cold, dead eyes just watched in disapproval. Judging me. \i Evaluating\i0 . While my insides spilled out onto the floor. It was pretty fucked up. And \i I\i0  had actually grown up with a dad who strangers would tell me all the time was famous for being one of the most powerful psychokinetics in the sector.{&1310}\par Morisant took his time, inspecting people here and there with his hands clasped behind his back -- looking bluff and unflappable and unimpressed. His poker face never broke. But he did say a word here or there about how well someone was doing when they were doing really well. It wasn't kind or enthusiastic or passionate in any way -- just a statement of fact. To those who weren't doing well, he didn't say a word. That pretty much included me by default.{&1310}\par If you couldn't tell that the semester was winding down by counting the days until graduation, you knew it by those two things alone. The instructors wild desperation to instill some ounce of terror into their cadets. The CO of our training unit quietly contemplating everyone with hard lines of pass or fail.  It had all the finality to it of something coming to an end. {&1310}\par But who would graduate and who would be booted out on their ass? That was always the question. Even from day one.{&1310}\par Kominshk was my partner for sparring. We went at it with the staff mostly, like we were supposed to. But you couldn't help mixing in some other hand-to-hand techniques here and there.  Yeguns was what the official name for them was, but no one used it -- not even the instructors really. It was a throwback from the old Imperial days and most people hated to hear that stuff now. But it was all just jingoism.{&1310}\par Like out on the running track, they'd used the environmental controls to liven up training. In here, they cranked up the temperature inside the combat practice room to near-boiling instead. Sweat coated the inside of my palms around my fighting stick and my hair felt sticky and gross no matter how tight I'd pulled it back. Strands of Komi's were bursting out in ragged clumps that slinked along her sweaty, brown face. Just looking at her made me feel overcooked and tired. But this was the one thing I could do better than her.{&1310}\par I squared off with Komi again and again. Sometimes she got me, but most of the time I sent her crashing down to the floor. It started to fade into redundancy and I became aware of the lieutenant walking along behind the cadets, appraising. I waited -- half-dreading, half-excited -- for him to reach us. When he did, he stopped for a minute. He actually stopped and watched.{&1310}\par I was distracted, but I still managed to block Komi's suddenly vigorous attack, turn it back, spin her around, and throw her into the ground. She tried even harder now that Morisant was watching. Her form and technique were good, but I was faster. I anticipated her almost every time, and beat her. I beat her -- while Morisant watched.{&1310}\par A part of me felt very satisfied with that.{&1310}\par Another part felt terrible that it had to be Komi getting beat.{&1310}\par "It's too bad, Weir," the lieutenant abruptly spoke and I just as abruptly lost my balance in surprise. Kominshk didn't hesitate in the attack she laid into me. I barely managed to parry her away.{&1310}\par "We might have found the one thing you're good at."{&1310}\par He moved on before I could even \i think\i0  to utter a "thank you, sir." He moved on, but those words stuck with me just the same. We'd been doing martial combat training sessions all semester long, but Morisant rarely took a closer look -- just standing at the head of the room to oversee the unit in general.
