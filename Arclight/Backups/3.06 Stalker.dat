It was bent over, looking like it was eating something. The weapon sang and bolts of electric fire punched out across the room at it. But the thing had howled and slipped out of sight before he'd even pulled the trigger. It skittered away into the dark again.{&1310}\par Julian fired after it, twisting around. He missed, but I barely noticed. That light sweeping across the room gave me an eyeful of a dozen slaughtered bodies.

She bolted.{&1310}\par Firebolts lit up the room behind one after another as I twisted around and threw myself in the opposite direction of where I thought that thing had gone. Too bad it was away from the front door and outside. There was still the back door, though.

She peeled away and I was left skipping ahead.{&1310}\par Tess stomped right up the stairs, tripping all over herself as she went. I managed to catch myself and spin around, screaming after her. I couldn't breathe, though, so I just threw myself back at the steps too. I saw Julian firing away in the front room still, turning about in an arc back toward where we were. But right before he could, something loomed up in front of the kitchen door right in front of my face. {&1310}\par My feet tried to fly out from under me. Somehow, I flung myself over into the stairs instead - right as that thing swiped in for me. I forgot Julian. I forgot Tess. I just scrambled up those steps on all fours as fast as I possibly could.{&1310}\par That fleshless shriek ripped at the coat on my back. My heart was inside my throat and those wooden stairs swam in my eyes as I clawed my way up. I kept catching my breath for something to slice through me from behind. But nothing did.{&1310}\par I reached the top and Tess was there, latching onto my arm and pulling me into the upstairs hall toward our abandoned room. She tripped over the door, kicking it wide and stumbling in with me dragging behind her. Then she flopped over the bed face-first, diving toward the far corner. I fell into the bathroom door, twisting back around and unable to breathe.{&1310}\par For a few seconds, it was just the sound of both of us panting aloud in that cramped room. Tess didn't bother righting herself - lying there with her head crooked between the wall and the floor and half under the bed. She just managed to cast a finger at me.{&1310}\par "... the door!" she gasped out.{&1310}\par I was already throwing myself at it before she could even open her mouth, though. I thought about the Eluvian man as I fumbled with that manual latch in my hands, but I knew. He was already dead too.{&1310}\par "Oh \i god\i0 ," Tess cried out when it was done, and I stumbled back, "Jules!" She must have been echoing my thoughts and realized where we had left him just as well as I did.{&1310}\par I had a sinking feeling all over as I staggered back into the corner of the bathroom doorframe again. My heart had settled somewhere between my chest and my neck, trying to gag me as my body went cold. I had flashes of all those people down there. Butchered pieces of bloody meat. Just like the ones on the ship ...{&1310}\par "Ev ..."{&1310}\par The quiet sound of Tess' voice from behind brought me back.

There were no magnetic seals. The door was made of wood. I cast around the room for something - \i anything\i0  - before I remembered the pistol I still had in my coat pocket. The duplicate to the one Tess had taken from me. I fumbled around with shaky hands until I found it.{&1310}\par I glanced back at Tess, and she was looking at me like I was crazy, tears glinting in the corners of her eyes. That didn't stop her from scrambling to get her own gun free from the pack on her back. She even managed to climb back to her feet.{&1310}\par "Wh-what are we gonna do, Ev?" she asked me. As if I had any clue. Those two dead bounty hunters were still in there - starting to make the place stink like meat. I shook my head, trying not to think about all the dead people piling up in that place around me.{&1310}\par "I ... I don't know!"{&1310}\par Something slammed into the door.{&1310}\par I'm not sure who screamed - Tess, or me. But we both started firing wildly at the door and the wall around with those three pistols we had. Bolts of fire hissed into wood, bursting into molten flame and punching holes right through the grain. Pulses of fire flashed in a sudden fury, inundating the dim lights in the room as we let loose on anything and everything in a frantic three-meter radius around that door until it was barely hanging onto its hinges anymore. Then we stood there, breathing heavy and still as everything went quiet again.{&1310}\par "... did we get it?"{&1310}\par I didn't look at Tess. I couldn't peel my eyes away from the door. Waiting with my breath catching inside my throat. She eventually fixed back on it too, pistol still stuck out in front of her and shaking in her hands. I wasn't much better. Still, she recognized the problem before I did.{&1310}\par "Shit!" she spat out when she realized the door was on fire from all those shots. We'd unloaded on it without thinking much about the wood. Those firebolts had lit it ablaze. The wall too.{&1310}\par I think I must have panicked, because the next thing I knew - I had locked myself inside the bathroom.\cf2\f2 {&1310}\par }{&1310}

There were no magnetic seals. The door was made of wood. I cast around the room for something - \i anything\i0  - before I remembered the pistol I still had in my coat pocket. The duplicate to the one Tess had taken from me. I fumbled around with shaky hands until I found it.{&1310}\par I glanced back at Tess, and she was looking at me like I was crazy, tears glinting in the corners of her eyes. That didn't stop her from scrambling to get her own gun free from the pack on her back. She even managed to climb back to her feet.{&1310}\par "Wh-what are we gonna do, Ev?" she asked me. As if I had any clue. Those two dead bounty hunters were still in there - starting to make the place stink like meat. I shook my head, trying not to think about all the dead people piling up in that place around me.{&1310}\par "I ... I don't know!"{&1310}\par Something slammed into the door.{&1310}\par I'm not sure who screamed - Tess, or me. But we both started firing wildly at the door and the wall around with those three pistols we had. Bolts of fire hissed into wood, bursting into molten flame and punching holes right through the grain. Pulses of fire flashed in a sudden fury, inundating the dim lights in the room as we let loose on anything and everything in a frantic three-meter radius around that door until it was barely hanging onto its hinges anymore. Then we stood there, breathing heavy and still as everything went quiet again.{&1310}\par "... did we get it?"{&1310}\par I didn't look at Tess. I couldn't peel my eyes away from the door. Waiting with my breath catching inside my throat. She eventually fixed back on it too, pistol still stuck out in front of her and shaking in her hands. I wasn't much better. Still, she recognized the problem before I did.{&1310}\par "Shit!" she spat out when she realized the door was on fire from all those shots. We'd unloaded on it without thinking much about the wood. Those firebolts had lit it ablaze. The wall too.{&1310}\par I think I must have panicked, because the next thing I knew - I had locked myself inside the bathroom.\cf2\f2 {&1310}\par }{&1310}
