Quickly. Quietly. No parting farewells from those they had known and grown old with for twenty years. No final words to betray them before they even started. Just the way Nolan wanted it. The way it had to be. The girl was not so pleased, though.{&1310}\par It was almost a day before Evelyn regained consciousness. And then it was only enough to wonder groggily aloud again where she was and what had happened. Thaddeus had reminded her broken, burnt body what it was before the attack. And it had taken her mind along with it. She was at a loss for what happened after two men ambushed her in the old maintenance tunnels on Riftwatch.{&1310}\par Nolan was content to leave it that way. The less she knew, the better and more protected she was. It was not like she was not in much of a position to fight with him either, though. And she was still convinced, despite her vague memories of the attack, that the whole affair was just some temporary, long-awaited sabbatical from the station. He was content to leave that the way it was too.{&1310}\par The trip fell into a brief routine of idle questions about his plans and half-lamented whimsy over leaving everyone on Riftwatch behind. Despite her condition, Evelyn continued to chatter excitedly about it all without the faintest idea about what he really meant to do or why. And Nolan buried himself in his thoughts about that very thing, barely leaving the pilot's chair for the entire thirty hours. {&1310}\par He hardly ate and didn't sleep. The girl must have started to suspect by the time they reached the station, even though she had been asleep for most of it. Her excitement abated too quickly, and she turned to studying him when she thought he wasn't paying attention instead. He made a note to himself to hide it better in the coming days.{&1310}\par The Riftway hub changed from a distant, unmoving speck against the black to a floating spire in a matter of hours. And Evelyn could hardly take her eyes off it once it came into view.{&1310}\par "What\i  is \i0 that?" she demanded from the front of the craft with her face all but pressed flat into the porthole. It interrupted his thoughts while he draped himself over the pilot's console, and she had to twist back around to get his attention. He glanced at the distant station, then at her, and finally back down to the console again.{&1310}\par "Our first stop," was all he said. Not that the girl would have left it at that.{&1310}\par "There?" she stabbed a finger eagerly at the station in the porthole. "We're going there?" Her head bobbed incredulously. "We're getting on \i that\i0  there?"{&1310}\par Nolan ignored the question, still pondering a decision. Evelyn was transfixed on the thing, though.{&1310}\par "Are there a lot of people onboard?" she pressed, eyes wide and mouth agape as she stood there wondering at the novelty of it all. {&1310}\par "Yes."{&1310}\par "From other colonies, you think? {&1310}\par Again. "Yes."{&1310}\par "{&1310}\par He tried to get back to his thoughts and planning, but it was impossible with the way she continued firing off inane questions about this and that and everything. Infuriating. Especially considering how much was at stake. He had to remind himself, though, that she had never known anything beyond Riftwatch in her entire life. Not so, for him.{&1310}\par They had to wait some time outside the waystation's limited docking facilities while a port freed up for them to come aboard. The place was just a minor departure point between several of the surrounding outposts and minor colonies, though a few larger ships did frequent there to ferry travelers to Dreggor's Door. He could see one of them now, hanging down beneath the station on a long pylon. The girl seized on that soon enough.{&1310}\par "{&1310}\par A few more hours passed, but Evelyn hardly wore herself out. By the time someone from the docking authority authorized them to come aboard, Nolan had a headache that was making him edgier than he had already been. He snapped at the girl once or twice as they finally disembarked, but it lost its bite in the loudness of the crowds that greeted them. They might have dampened her spirits too, being some of the dirtiest, most unkempt people she must have ever seen, but it was hard to tell. He knew it was not the most welcome sight to his own eyes after so many years away.{&1310}\par "Evelyn! Stay near me."{&1310}\par She had started off almost immediately and he had to rein her in like a small child. The look she gave him back over her shoulder was about as petulant. He snatched her hand firmly in his and dragged her along behind him.{&1310}\par The crowd was hard to push through, it was so thick down by the docks. They couldn't help being jostled by people who had more filth and diseases than Nolan cared to think about. Riftwatch had been a clean, controlled place. The irony of suddenly succumbing to something simple after all that time did not sit well with him at all. Places like that did not have good scrubbers.{&1310}\par He got them on an elevator to the upper decks first. That was even more unpleasant than the docking areas they left behind. He suffered several more minutes squashed together with more of the system's vagrants than he could have hoped for to get to a free terminal on the promenade decks.{&1310}\par "Wait right here," he told the girl with a harsh eye when they got there. She played irritated and impatient with him, folding her arms and glancing wistfully about. He just rounded on the terminal, however, and started with his message.{&1310}\par It took a few minutes. Despite the abruptness of the whole affair, matters were still going according to plan and on schedule. Not that he had left much room for doubt. He had had more than twenty years to prepare for that moment after all. More than enough time to get it right.{&1310}\par But never without a few doubts.{&1310}\par "Evelyn."{&1310}\par The girl jumped when he turned around and called her name. She had still been standing there behaving - a small miracle. Her attention had been elsewhere, though, and he had to snap her out of it.{&1310}\par "What were you looking at?"{&1310}\par He came up beside her, glancing the way she had been staring. It had not been the whimsical fancy of the past minutes or several hours. And he could worry about so abrupt a shift in her out here.{&1310}\par "Nothing," she shook her head quickly, though, dismissing it. "I just ... I thought I saw someone."{&1310}\par "Come on." He took her by the arm and started pulling her away again. A few looks over his shoulder were not wasted in his wary concerns.{&1310}\par There was no incident as they reached another elevator down to the transport ship they would be taking. The girl sobered some, but still bubbled with that enthusiasm. And, for a few moments, Nolan could almost entertain the fantasy of that turning into a real holiday of sorts for her, with home waiting up for them to return. He crushed it in his head quickly enough, though.{&1310}\par A few more hours as they waited to board the passenger ship \i Menhir\i0 , however, bled a little bit more of that excitement right out of her. She was downright manageable by the time they were allowed in. And the accomodations she had to look forward to were little better than that of a refugee camp, buried in the bowels of the ship. Anything else would have meant registering with the passenger manifest. And that was something he would not do.{&1310}\par So they made it on board with little incident. Unnoticed. Ignored by fellow passengers and crew alike. Just like he had planned. And, just like he had planned, they were underway and flying fast toward Dreggor within forty-eight hours of the enemy's first move.\cf2\f1 {&1310}\par }{&1310}
