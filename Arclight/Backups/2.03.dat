It helped beat back the air that was trying to beat me back, but I could still feel it clawing at my skin and thrashing at sticks and weeds as I ran. It might have been a forest I landed in - what with all those humongous trees everywhere. I lost sight of the smoke trail inside them. My feet carried me as straight as they could, though I kept tripping over them. Dried leaves crunched underfoot and soft earth yielded, making me bounce along broken branches and creeping roots. I got that faceful of dirt a few times before I could chuck myself back up and forward. If it was even possible, I was twice as beat up by the time I found the trail again.{&1310}\par Canopies peeled back in the wind, and I caught another whiff of smoke. I squinted up above the trees, choking out heavy breaths, and could just make it out with the sun still beating down brighter than life. I kicked myself and started up hobbling along again that way.{&1310}\par The brush got thicker, and I had to scale a boulder or two just to reach a fallen, rotting log to roll myself haphazardly over. I was sweating, breathless, and stumbling when I saw a splintered stake of wood on fire sticking out of the ground. I leaned against a tree beside me and just stared at it for a second while I sucked in air through my teeth.{&1310}\par A big, steaming hunk of metal lay still just beyond.{&1310}\par I was shakier on my feet when I finally managed to push off again. This time, it wasn't the ground tripping me up. Eyes kept darting around that crashed pod, desperate for any sign of anyone. I half-stumbled, half-trudged-jogged over that way. But no one else was there.{&1310}\par Small fires and huge chunks of ash in upturned dirt littered the clearing where the pod had landed. At least \i now \i0 it was a clearing. Trees lay felled, burnt, and exploded into timbers all around. A few had even collapsed on top of the thing itself, and I had to climb underneath to get to it.{&1310}\par Holding onto the trunk of one of those downed trees, I was able to swing myself down behind the pod. The rear hatch port was small, and cracked. No help there. I didn't bother trying to look inside.{&1310}\par "Okay," I took a deep breath. "There's gotta be a release somewhere on this thing ..."{&1310}\par I scrounged around on the ground for a minute or so. Sweating, filthy, and wilting in the heat. Dirt rained down from the broken trees above and I tried unsuccessfully to ignore it. But it wasn't until I tried to grab a hold of metal that I realized it wasn't the sun making her sweat this time. It was the pod.{&1310}\par I snatched that hand back before it melted my skin off. And stared dumbly at the bark on those trees atop the thing that had caught fire.{&1310}\par "Well. That was \i almost \i0 stupid."{&1310}\par I could hear some biting thing Bertram would say in the back of my head and I managed a laugh.{&1310}\par "Thanks, Bertram."{&1310}\par I couldn't figure it out to open it. But it wasn't like I had anything better to do anyways. So I climbed back out away from those flames, and waited.{&1310}\par And waited.{&1310}\par And waited.{&1310}\par And eventually, it cooled down.{&1310}\par A lifetime later and I could get close enough to find the dumb release. Close enough to realize it was already slightly open ... But I tried not to think about that too much. {&1310}\par So I just popped it all the way, and the pod flipped back its rear hatch, squealing loudly at me and the rest of the trees. It quit halfway through. I had to yank it the rest of the way to look inside.{&1310}\par It was empty.{&1310}\par And I stared down inside, uncomprehending. I couldn't wipe the relief and excitement off my face from a second ago. It just did its work of slowly dying over the next few.{&1310}\par "Ev?" I asked to the empty space beneath. For some reason, it didn't feel like answering me back.{&1310}\par "... Doctor Weir ... ?"{&1310}\par That didn't seem to work either.{&1310}\par They had been in that pod. They \i had\i0  been. I was sure of it. And I had waited. I had waited for others.{&1310}\par Maybe I didn't see it at first. Or I just didn't want to. I blinked my eyes, pulling back. The sun poured in without me blocking its way. And suddenly those dark smudges all over the place weren't just shadows' play on the inside. It was blood.{&1310}\par I reeled. Everything started to recede from outside me, like the blood was seeping its way back in close to the heart. First slow. Then faster and faster. I drowned in a whitewash of white noise and, the next thing I knew, I was on the ground in the dirt.{&1310}\par Things started to slowly push back out from where they were trapped inside my skull. Feeling started to creep into my hands and feet, fingers and toes. And with it, the horrible thought that -{&1310}\par No. {&1310}\par They couldn't be -{&1310}\par No. I couldn't even think it. I shook my head so hard it almost came off. I started to wish it would.{&1310}\par No.{&1310}\par They had gotten out of there. I was already been too late. I must have been. They were free and out and already making their way through the forest back to somewhere safe.{&1310}\par I clawed my way back up to my feet.{&1310}\par I scrounged around the pod, desperate for any tracks. A footprint in the ash and mud, some trampled brush - anything. I made five runs around the steaming pod and cinders of fallen trees and ... nothing.{&1310}\par Giving up might have started to seem pretty good right about then. Maybe to someone else. Anyone else. Except I had no idea what else I could possibly do if I didn't find them. I was lost. And alone. I didn't even know what stupid planet I was on.{&1310}\par I did find something, though. Eventually. {&1310}\par I was grasping at straws and fading hopes when I reached the edge of the clearing, arms wrapped tight around me to ward of the inevitable realization and hopelessness. I could feel it coming just around the bend, but I wasn't ready for it yet. I'm not stupid, but ... I wasn't ready for it yet. {&1310}\par But that's when I found a footprint in the dirt.{&1310}\par Or maybe not.{&1310}\par I stopped, and bent low. It looked like ... \i something\i0 , anyways. {&1310}\par Something heavy had printed in the dirt there. I don't know much about those things, but someone always did in terrestrial vids. There were no other tracks around it. They just started up there, a dozen meters away from the pod, and tore away into the woods. Nothing like shoeprints anyways.{&1310}\par I looked up that way, gradually. And it made the hairs on the back of my neck perk up. For a while, all I could do was stare into those shadows hidden away from the blinding sun beneath the trees. And breathe.{&1310}\par It got real quiet. All I could hear was myself and that emptiness between me in the whitewashed clearing and that darkness that managed to find somewhere to hide beneath that light. Then something else abruptly broke the silence from behind.{&1310}\par Thunder cracked loud in the clouds above some distance off. No rain, though, or lightning. Just a heavy orange-yellow glow as they billowed out like steam from a covered pot. I shielded my eyes to look up and watched as they suddenly belched up a flaming ball of molten metal then. It howled out of that hole in the sky and flashed down toward the ground. The earth rattled, and nearly took me right up off my feet again as the thing plunged into the forest not too far away. When it was all over, I just stood there for a long moment, swallowing hard. {&1310}\par She had been wrong before, and hadn't waited long enough. But that couldn't stop her now. Without even a glance back at that dark spot in the woods, she took of as fast as her battered and bruised body would carry her. After that other pod.\cf2\f1 {&1310}\par }{&1310}
