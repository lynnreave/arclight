If the dark didn't get me killed, my eyes would. I couldn't keep tears from blinding them.{&1310}\par I swam forward, lashing out with my blood-stained hands for anything along the way and pulling myself along through the black and low, red light. My chest shook - the only sound in the dark around me. I couldn't make it stop. I tried. {&1310}\par I hit another door. Spun myself around. And grabbed at the crack between them. I started prying them open, still wracked with shaking sobs that wouldn't go away. Just enough to peek into the next passageway.{&1310}\par Something leapt at my face as soon as I did.{&1310}\par That skin-ripping scream. I choked on my tongue, or else I would have screamed too. It slashed at me through the crack. Something caught in my side. Then more blood was spilling into the air.{&1310}\par I flung back. It howled, rearing and clawing at the door like a rabid animal. And it wasn't alone. There was a whole other cabin out there. Not another corridor. A dozen of those things were suddenly flying and ripping at the metal between them and me.{&1310}\par The door bent. Huge dents popped back in places. That warbling scream turned into a crescendo, making my ears bleed. I screamed too this time.{&1310}\par I guess I was dead. I saw dad and that man in my head, bleeding out on the floor from a length of gleaming steel blacker than night. I saw all those bodies too, in pieces all over everything. And I saw myself. That ship ... it was just one big, bloody tomb for all of us.{&1310}\par My body floated over, bawling in the dark while those things tore open the door from the other side. I might have tried to run, but I got nowhere hanging there in midair. Instead, my hand found the gun in my jacket pocket. {&1310}\par It was still there. I lost everything and everyone else. But, somehow, I still had that. And I stabbed it out at those things without another thought.{&1310}\par I yanked on the trigger, and ...{&1310}\par Nothing.{&1310}\par Again.{&1310}\par Nothing.{&1310}\par Razored limbs whipped out like a frenzied mass of tentacles at the door. Howling and snarling and teeth like claws snapping bone. Metal groaned, and howled too. It started to finally come apart altogether.{&1310}\par I think I screamed again, shrieking fury and helplessness at that whole bloody mess. But no sound came out this time. Or they just drowned me out. I might have just thrown the pistol at them too. But I remembered something then. For once in my entire life ... I remembered something someone had told me right when it mattered.{&1310}\par I clicked the safety off. Bertram had switched it back on. {&1310}\par And I fired.{&1310}\par This time, light flashed bright in the dark.{&1310}\par That first shot went wide. It seared the door with a black mark and a whiff of ash. The next was better, though. And so was the next after that.{&1310}\par Bolts of fire hammered into the fleshy space between those doors. The things kept howling and screaming their throat-rending screams out at me. One fell back. Maybe. It was hard to tell in the dark. They thrashed so much. For all the good it seemed to do, those things barely noticed. They just kept coming.{&1310}\par Holes appeared all over the door. It was already bent out of shape, folding in at me. It started to give way.{&1310}\par There were too many of them. I realized that. Eventually. Wild-eyed and firing blindly into that murderous frenzy to get at me and rip me apart. Then I spun myself back around to swim away.{&1310}\par Doorframes. Floor grates. Emergency light fixtures. It didn't matter. I clawed, scratched, and snatched at anything with some purchase. Anything that got me further away back down the hall from that blood-mad howling. Too slow. I was just too slow. It chased me all the way down the corridor into the next. And that was where I finally heard it.{&1310}\par The worst sound I had ever heard in my life. The sound of that door ripping into pieces.{&1310}\par The faceless screaming tore at the walls all up the red and black passage at me. Clicking on metal as they suddenly rushed headlong after, filling up the dark behind. I didn't look back. There was some kind of desk beside me in the corridor - an open space in the dead air beside. I swung myself over and through, then slide underneath.{&1310}\par There were a few seconds then where I couldn't hear anything but the blood rushing through my head. So loud it drowned everything else out. Those things tore down the hallway in slow motion, and my world narrowed down to the rabid thumping in my chest. {&1310}\par I closed my eyes to shut it out.{&1310}\par And saw that dead forest from my dreams instead.{&1310}\par Those men were torn apart, shredded by shadow. Firebolts firing wildly and running desperate in the fog. For a moment it was those people on board that ship instead, as they fled screaming through the halls being butchered into pieces all along the decks. I saw it like it all happened in an instant right in front of me then. It didn't feel like a dream. Now it felt real.{&1310}\par My eyes opened again.{&1310}\par That throatless screaming was fading away down the corridor. It had passed right by me and I could hear it lashing out at the bulkheads back the way I had come, echoing like a waking nightmare. I could almost breathe again, and the shivering wasn't so violent anymore. I eased clammy palms against the underside of the desk where I floated and swallowed hard. My whole body shuddered.{&1310}\par Something slammed into the desktop above me.{&1310}\par I jerked, sucking in air. Then froze up, wide-eyed and staring through that metal like I could see through to the other side. Hands still flat against the underbelly, I felt it strain and shake with that thing on top it. For one long, terrible moment ... I waited for it to come down for me there.{&1310}\par But it didn't. I managed to slowly edge my head around into the small cubby-room I was in behind that desk. The breath stuck fast in my throat again. The low, red lights from the corridor painted shadows on the wall. One of them was huge, sitting right on top of that open space, and moving.{&1310}\par I waited, and listened. There was nothing else to do, struck frozen stiff beneath the desk. Clicking. This one did not scream at me. Instead there was the wet sound of somethng ripping and scratching just on the other side of that metal between us. Inches away from my face.{&1310}\par It took me some time. But, eventually, I noticed the man-like shape underneath that bulk of shadow twitching against the wall. At least, I noticed the head shape sticking out to one side of it. And I watched the shades play against the wall as it dug into that corpse and chewed it to fleshy pieces.{&1310}\par A hand flopped over, hanging just over the edge of the desk and trickling blood down its fingers. Two of them were missing. A woman's hand. I fixed on that for a long time while the thing ripped into skin and bone and organ. I fixed on that for a long time after the thing was finished and clicked away after the others.\cf2\f2 {&1310}\par }{&1310}

Those things tore down the hallway in slow motion, and my world narrowed down to the rabid thumping in my chest. {&1310}\par {&1310}\par {&1310}\par But I guess I finally got lucky with one of those wild shots. And I guess they liked bigger viewports on the upper deck cabins. Because one of those bolts went wide again and through. And must have hit glass. Because the whole room suddenly decompressed.{&1310}\par It was abrupt. One second I was firing into that boiling mass of murderous flesh and vicious claws, and the next, the room stared to come apart. Wind whipped past me, howling like all the demons in hell. Those things screamed above it, still thrashing at the door. As I watched, they peeled away one by one, yanked back out of sight. It all happened in the blink of a eye. And then the wind came for me.{&1310}\par I went hurtling toward the doors again and one of those fleshy maws still howling. I hit it with both feet and it flew away back into the room with the others.{&1310}\par It tried to suck me through the crack in the door, screaming all the way. It got me about halfway. Then I stuck. Hard. And it didn't stop trying.{&1310}\par My breathing stopped, choked off. Metal stabbed into my chest, caving in bone. I could almost hear it crunch above the howling. And my eyes squeezed shut. My shoes started to come off.{&1310}\par It was the worst pain I had ever felt in my life.{&1310}\par I nearly passed out before safety shields slipped down over the breach. My whole world was a narrow, black tunnel. Then I could suddenly breathe again. Enough to gasp out back to life and realize I was still stuck fast in the twisted door. It was still trying to cut me in half.{&1310}\par I got my hands between either side. Somehow. I could just barely breathe, choking on air as it tried to claw me apart from the inside. My body was already broken in too many ways. I sobbed a few notes there through my teeth alone in the dark.{&1310}\par Maybe it took pity on me. I know I would have. But one of the doors broke. Those things had torn it apart so badly it bent right back on its threads. And I cried out as it clawed its way down my back until I was free.{&1310}\par I'm not sure how I did it, but I managed to squeeze myself back out. I squirmed out into the corridor again, squished free like toothpaste from a tube. Except it was blood and organs I had inside of me. And they were all trying to get out.{&1310}\par By the time I could breathe right, that was all I did for the longest time. Floating there in the dark, red light.\cf2\f2 {&1310}\par }{&1310}

That ship ... it was just one big, bloody tomb for all of us.{&1310}\par My body floated over, bawling in the dark while those things tore open the door from the other side. I might have tried to run, but I got nowhere hanging there in midair. Instead, my hand found the gun in my jacket pocket. {&1310}\par It was still there. I lost everything and everyone else.

It started to finally come apart altogether.{&1310}\par I think I screamed again, shrieking fury and helplessness at that whole bloody mess. But no sound came out this time. Or they just drowned me out. I might have just thrown the pistol at them too. But I remembered something then. For once in my entire life ... I remembered something someone had told me right when it mattered.{&1310}\par I clicked the safety off. Bertram had switched it back on. {&1310}\par And I fired.{&1310}\par This time, light flashed bright in the dark.{&1310}\par That first shot went wide. It seared the door with a black mark and a whiff of ash. The next was better, though. And so was the next after that.{&1310}\par Bolts of fire hammered into the fleshy space between those doors. The things kept howling and screaming their throat-rending screams out at me. One fell back. Maybe. It was hard to tell in the dark. They thrashed so much. For all the good it seemed to do, those things barely noticed. They just kept coming.{&1310}\par Holes appeared all over the door. It was already bent out of shape, folding in at me. It started to give way.{&1310}\par There were too many of them. I realized that. Eventually. Wild-eyed and firing blindly into that murderous frenzy to get at me and rip me apart. Then I spun myself back around to swim away.{&1310}\par Doorframes. Floor grates. Emergency light fixtures. It didn't matter. I clawed, scratched, and snatched at anything with some purchase.

Firebolts firing wildly and running desperate in the fog.

I saw it like it all happened in an instant right in front of me then. It didn't feel like a dream. Now it felt real.{&1310}\par My eyes opened again.{&1310}\par That throatless screaming was fading away down the corridor. It had passed right by me and I could hear it lashing out at the bulkheads back the way I had come, echoing like a waking nightmare. I could almost breathe again, and the shivering wasn't so violent anymore. I eased clammy palms against the underside of the desk where I floated and swallowed hard. My whole body shuddered.{&1310}\par Something slammed into the desktop above me.{&1310}\par I jerked, sucking in air. Then froze up, wide-eyed and staring through that metal like I could see through to the other side. Hands still flat against the underbelly, I felt it strain and shake with that thing on top it. For one long, terrible moment ... I waited for it to come down for me there.{&1310}\par But it didn't. I managed to slowly edge my head around into the small cubby-room I was in behind that desk, the breath stuck fast in my throat again. The low, red lights from the corridor painted shadows on the wall. One of them was huge, sitting right on top of that open space, and moving.{&1310}\par I waited, and listened. There was nothing else to do, struck frozen stiff beneath the desk. Clicking. This one did not scream at me. Instead there was the wet sound of somethng ripping and scratching just on the other side of that metal between us. Inches away from my face.{&1310}\par It took me some time. But, eventually, I noticed the man-like shape underneath that bulk of shadow twitching against the wall. At least, I noticed the head-like shape sticking out to one side of it. And I watched the shades play against the wall as it dug into that corpse and chewed it to fleshy pieces.{&1310}\par A hand flopped over, hanging just over the edge of the desk and trickling blood down its fingers.
