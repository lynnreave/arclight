\viewkind4\uc1\pard\sl0\slmult1\cf1\lang1033\fs22 The power source for all advanced technology has begun to fail, while pirates plunder any of it that can find that hasn't. Evelyn Weir is a terrible recruit to the Grand Admirals' psychokinetic training program and all but flunks out before her home is attacked py pirates while she's on leave. Her father is killed and she is forced to flee for her life. Somehow blamed for the attack and on the run from the law, she joins her best friend, a vigilante, and two special agents in putting a stop to the pirate attacks in the sector once and for all.
