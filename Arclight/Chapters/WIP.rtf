\par Oh, sure, hiding out for our lives made it hard to marvel at that. A real planetside city with not thousands but \i millions\i0  of people. All just - \i living\i0  there. I couldn't even get my head around it. And it was almost easy to forget we were trapped inside that apartment. For the first time in my life I felt claustrophobic for want of the outside. You could \i feel\i0  the life thumping dully like blood through veins just beyond the walls. It was never quiet here.
